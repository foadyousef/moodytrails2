0,2019-09-03,['hiking'],Great workout!
1,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"First, don’t park next to paved road, drive down dirt road to right for TH parking. This one had LOTS of sun, wildflowers are poppin, and great views. Route can be hard to find after north peak but I did as others suggested and stayed near spine for most part and feel like I had a pretty good route (you can look at my recording). I never felt unsafe, or had my exposure-induced-anxiety kick in BUT if you have poles I’d definitely bring them bc of all the loose rock....and to make the stubborn grasshoppers move (there were lots of em)."
2,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",This trail was awesome! It is pretty rocky toward the end so be prepared. Bring plenty of water and put on sunscreen. 
3,2019-09-02,"['no shade', 'rocky']","Great Trail, awesome views. Quite steep at points. I will do it again for sure!"
4,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Awesome hike. This trail is steep but not nearly as bad as I was expecting compared to the other big mountains in the Wasatch. It took us 4 and a half hours to do the entire thing, my garmin put the distance a little over 9 miles. It is a lot of scree and loose rock near the top. Do-able for dogs but bring lots of water."

6,2019-08-31,['hiking'],Hiked loop over North peak of Mt. Nebo then down to Wolf Pass and back. Amazing views. Beautiful trail. Moderately hard in some spots. Flowers in bloom in upper meadows were wonderful. 
7,2019-08-31,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'off trail', 'rocky']",
8,2019-08-28,['hiking'],Way harder than anticipated. But totally worth it. Amazing views!
9,2019-08-24,['hiking'],Highly recommend staying close to the ridge for as long as you can!!
10,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"Great dog friendly trail, though we did Nebo Peak, so it was more than the 8.5 miles listed for the hike.  Beautiful views, and Amazing wildflowers!  
No water anywhere on the hike so come prepared with lots of water"
11,2019-08-24,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Hiked all the way to the peak on Saturday--THE INFO ON THIS PAGE IS NOT FOR GETTING TO THE PEAK, ONLY TO THE SADDLE BEFORE IT. I've had a hard time finding good info on the actual hike/vertical rise to the peak, but between some other hikers, our tracking devices, and myself, we estimated that the entire hike to the peak is about 10.5 miles and 4800/ft vertical rise. 

I saw a lot of nervous dogs and hikers on the knife edge section to the peak; it's a bad place for your pup to take a tumble, and the shale is hard on their paws. I was very glad my dogs weren't with me, and I'd recommend you leave even the most level-headed dog at home.

I'm moderately fit, and the entire hike took me eight hours. From wolf pass, it took me two hours to reach the peak, and two to come back down--it's a steep scramble with unsure footing, and you don't have any choice but to go slowly. 

The wildflowers are GORGEOUS right now. 

"
12,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"Just be prepared to slip, slide, maybe trip on the shell rocks in the upper part of the hike to the summit.  My iWatch tracked 10.3 miles, wife's was over ten too.  Some in our party wished they had gloves for rock scrambling and the lower temps on top.
As others have said, parking lot was full (8:30am), stay close to the ridge, wild flowers are awesome.
Wear sunscreen and have plenty of water.  Definitely a quad and calves burner."
13,2019-08-23,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Trail is good until you get to wolf pass and after that it gets quite steep which wouldn’t be a problem except it’s a lot of loose rock up to the false summit and then it’s nothing but sharp shell rock with trails going everywhere so pay attention to route so you don’t get in trouble! Also it was pretty disappointing there was no registry or something at the top to really designate the summit!
14,2019-08-17,['hiking'],Lefted the truck around 515ish am. Had to flashlight the early morning. What a sunrise sight! What a display of wildflowers! It's a challenge! But so worth it. And a peak to brag about. 
15,2019-08-17,['hiking'],We hiked just to the north peak today.  The wildflowers are in full bloom and it is spectacular.  We got to the trailhead at 7 am and the parking area was already full.  Lots of people enjoying the view and the fresh air.
16,2019-08-12,"['hiking', 'scramble']",Beautiful wild flowers; many mountain goats 
17,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'scramble']",
18,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",traversed North Peak to South peak. Then continue Southword.
19,2019-08-10,['hiking'],"Best wildflower display of any Utah hike I've been on.  Though less overall elevation gain than Timpanogas, I rate this as tougher as the incline sections are very steep.  On the way to the top the trail loses altitude often which is why the inclines have to be steep to get over 3800 ft. of gain. It also means there are many inclines on the way back.  Very rewarding but challenging.  Trail conditions today were ideal (cloud cover much of the day, cool temps, no dust  as it rained the night  before...)"
20,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'scramble']","Amazing hike we showed up at 6am. The weather was perfect and the views are out of this world!! This hike is pretty tough especially if you don’t hike often. The last mile is really tough and is very steep, with loose gravel and would not be a good time for little ones. Overall a must do in the Wasatch front!!! "
21,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Hit the trail at 430pm and the weather was fantastic! One of the more beautiful hikes. Trail is clear and easy to follow. Saw lots of mountain goats. The final push to the summit stay on the spine.  I took a faux path and wound up in sketchy loose rock. The spine was much easier and solid to follow. 
22,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"No snow crossings on the trail. Little traffic. Watch for afternoon thunderstorms that roll through. Great temperatures and great views.  Took me 4.5 hours, including waiting out a couple storms. Nebo's Peak was cloudy most of the afternoon."
23,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"First time doing Nebo. It was BADA! 
Trail had a few snow drifts but you could get around them. So no gear needed. This sucker was long, and crazy rugged at the top. Def a “hard” level hike. But super beautiful lots of wild flowers and killer views. tot worth every step.  Oh and cool 60deg "
24,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Hiked Mount Nebo on 7/15. Two definite snow crossings. One traverse before wolf pass. the other was just before the false summit and more steep and intimidating. Traction would have been nice, especially in the morning, but able to cross with help from trekking poles. After the false summit the trail was all clear. Stay close to the ridge line. Snow was much softer in the afternoon but crossable by taking our time.  On the way down we took the opportunity to do some glissading. This was our first time climbing nebo. The trail was steep but the exposure was less intimidating than many of the reviews made it out. Enjoy! 

"
25,2019-07-10,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","The trails open! Hiked this on 7/5/19. Honestly, it's still pretty sketchy with a few large glacier crossings, and an almost vertical climb to get to the summit since the trail is snowed over. Bottom couple miles is mostly clear, and you can generally avoid snow on the ridgeline. Took a lot longer than planned because of all the snow. Right now microspikes and good poles are a necessity, ice picks help with descents and if you end up falling. The difficulty rating of this trail is no joke, it's a beast to hike."
26,2019-07-05,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'snow']",Hiked this trail prepared for the snow with snowshoes and microspikes. Still a lot of sketchy glacier crossings. Plan extra time. It took us longer than we thought and were unable to summit because of the snow. Amazing views!
27,2019-07-02,['hiking'],Snow still in upper swales and ridges of Nebo. Lower 1.5 miles snow free and flowers starting to peak. 
28,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",There is still a lot of snow on this trail. I did not have my ice climbing boots so I was only able to make it about 1000 feet from the North peak. from the parking area the first mile of the trail was clear but after that it is all icy snow and the trail becomes hard to follow. the vegetation is stunning. well worth the time. I plan on going back later this week with the right footgear.
29,2019-06-24,['hiking'],Road is closed at Devils Kitchen and about 5 miles from the trailhead coming from the other side. 
30,2019-02-11,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, one of my favorite to do late summer. Challenging in some areas, and a little treacherous at the top, but also a lot of easy rolling area and gradual ascents. Takes most of a day, but easy to run a majority of the way down which makes it a lot faster :)"
31,2018-10-06,['hiking'],"Great hike. Tough hike. Several steep and technical sections but overall challenging enough and very rewarding. The false summit will have you fooled but if you keep pushing, you'll make it to the top and love the views. From the the false summit to the top, the trail is a little tricky to follow. Be careful! Took me just over 3 hours roundtrip with no breaks until the top and some trail running on the way down."
32,2018-09-13,['hiking'],Not for the faint of heart but once you come down from the summit and look back it is exhilarating and satisfying to know that you made it!  We had to keep encouraging each other to get through the sketchy parts but finally made it and had the summit all to ourselves for lunch.  Stay on the ridge near the top as described earlier.  Took us 6.5 hours total.  4.5 hours up and 2 hours down (with some running).  Highly recommended!
33,2018-08-27,[''],Literally finished this hike 3 hours ago. It’s a beast but worth it. The hardest portion is the false summit and Nebo itself as you are dealing with shell rock and scrambling up Nebo. My buddy and I finished in 5 hours and 15 minutes. 3 hours up and 2 hours and 15 minutes. Going down is just as hard as it is steep and lots of loose rock. Bring plenty of fluids and write your name in the book inside the jar on the summit!!!
34,2018-08-26,['hiking'],"This hike is tough with steep and sustained climbs and a fair amount of scrambling and ridgeline traverses but is also full of beautiful, even breathtaking vistas throughout. While reaching the summit is by far the hardest, this trail will work you out in both directions. Lots of big game animal sightings and more to view and take in there and back again. Plan on at least several hours for the round trip. And do take all the water you'll need -- there are no sources from which to filter along the way."
35,2018-08-23,['hiking'],Very beautiful hike. easy to fallow the trail. kind of hard to hike from false peak to actual peak ( just stay on the top ridge).
36,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"Don't be scared away by some of the other reviews! This is a great hike. Yes, it does have some steeper, more technical sections. Parts of it are more difficult than anything you would see on Timp, but overall I would say it's less difficult than Timp and much shorter. On the other hand, it's significantly easier than Provo Peak hiked from the valley. The steep section is maybe half of Provo Peak's ascent. The view from the top is amazing and hiking along the ridge can be pretty fun!

As many people have said, stay on the ridge. There are two false peaks. The first one is after Wolf Pass (just after hiking around the side of North Peak). The ascent here is the most strenuous. The second false peak is right before Nebo. Near the top of each of these, there are many paths leading off to the left. These are especially deceiving because the actual trail can be difficult to see when looking up from below. These other paths are not the trail and are much more difficult and even dangerous. For both false peaks, you want to go straight over the top of the peak. You can see in my recording that on the ascent we went off to the left for both peaks, which didn't turn out well. Try to follow the path we took on the descent, just straight over the peaks.

We summited in just under 2.5 hours, with maybe 10 minutes of breaks included in that. After about 20 minutes on the summit, we made it down in about 1.5 hours with a bit of trail running."
37,2018-08-08,['hiking'],"Amazing Views! Strenous, but well worth it! The tallest mountain in the Wasatch Range! Amazing flowers in August! :-)"
38,2018-08-06,['hiking'],Awesome hike but very strenuous.  Bring lots of snacks and protein bars.  And at least a 3 or 4 liters of water.  Very beautiful but has steep climbs and two false summits.  It's dog friendly but don't bring older/senior dogs.
39,2018-08-05,['hiking'],"I cannot add anything new than what has already been said in these reviews. I will reiterate and stress these points though. 

1- It is very steep when ascending the false peaks. As someone who’s hiked Timp many times I can say that this was much more difficult. Be self aware of your conditioning and be prepared for some thigh busting, lung burning action here!

2- Take LOTS of water! You will need it no joke. 

3- Bring a wind jacket. The top is super windy and chills you pretty good after you’re all sweaty. 

I probably won’t be doing this bad boy again anytime soon. But I don’t regret doing it either. Great views and feels awesome after your done!"
40,2018-08-04,[''],"Took us 4 hours to go up, 2.5 going back down. We were a young group in our mid 20s and went a steady pace with only a handful of short breaks. Try some yells at the first summit, it will echo like crazy!!!! This was a tough hike that kicked our butts by the time we got back to the car but it was challenging and fun on the way up!"
41,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"Nebo North is a great hike. You get fantastic views almost the entire trail. The first 1.5-2 miles is fairly easy. After that there are a couple really steep sections. The first climbs up to the first false summit. From there you traverse over to the bottom of the second false summit. The climb to the top of that is steep and loose. Make sure you stay on the trail. It's much easier. The trail on the way up the second false summit tends to run straight up the middle of the mountain or maybe a bit to the right. Don't veer left. Once on top of that summit, the trail typically is on the north side of the saddle. Stay on that and you'll have the easiest final climb to the top."
42,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"She’s a steep one. There’s a few cute chipmunks at the top, get ready for a climb tho."
43,2018-07-23,['hiking'],"The steep is real, be ready for your legs to melt underneath you en route to the final “scramble” - at which point you’ll have to shift into maximum overdrive and push for the summit. Absolutely worth the hard work, the view from the top is unreal."
44,2018-07-08,['hiking'],"After reading all the comments, we decided to drive out to Nebo and see what all the rage was about. For reference, we are pretty experienced hikers, one of us coming from LA and the other from Providence, RI (so both at sea level with about a week of acclimation in Park City at ~7000ft). 

The first part of the hike was beautiful. The hills were a little less gentle than some commenters have suggested, especially with the altitude (for all you out of towners), but it was nothing serious. The wildflowers were beautiful. 

The hike began to get real when we hit the first significant climb. You walk into a big valley and see a notch extending through the center with tall trees going up either side. Here, you cross the notch from left to right and begin to climb. We estimate we gained about 700-800 feet in this section in less than a mile. It is steep and the trail is loose, dusty dirt. However, we both felt comfortable and at the top of the climb, felt like it was manageable and felt ready to keep going. 

After this, you gain a ridge line and walk along a gently rolling path until you arrive at the base of the false summit. In the 1/2 mile leading up to this, you can see both Nebo and the false summit on the right and left respectively. The route to the false summit is another significant climb, perhaps gaining another 800 feet in about a mile of hiking. Once you get to the top of the false summit, it is a good time to take a little break and begin to plan your attempt at the peak. 

The final stage of the hike is very different from the first part. You walk along a tight, loose, rocky ridge above tree line. The path is not clearly demarcated and it is up to you to choose the path of least resistance. The ridge line is narrow and the drop off on either side is steep. My best advice, after completing the hike today (which others also suggest), is to stay as close to the top of the ridge as possible. Paths diverging to the left and right side can look inviting, however, many of these paths begin to drift off into loose shale and scree. While it can be intimidating to walk on top of a narrow, rocky ridge, you will find the path of least resistance here over and over again. 

The final push to the summit is scrappy and includes some scrambling. It's a good idea to test rocks with your hand/foot before trusting them. The things that look like paths are not always a good indicator of the best route -- we found that doing some class 4 or perhaps very easy class 5 scrambling/climbing made our lives a lot easier because we were able to feel secure with what we were holding and standing on. 

The route down from the summit requires patience. As is often the case, it is slow going when you head down on a hike like this. Keep a cool head and, again, follow the ridge as much as possible. After you hit the top of the false summit, the rest of the hike flies by. 

Our total time was 5 hours 50 minutes, 3:20 on the way up and 2:30 on the way down. This excludes a 20 minute pit stop we took on the peak to admire the views. 

In general, I would consider this a stout hike, but nothing terribly difficult. The real difficulty in this one lies in the mental game. It is significantly exposed and requires some confident scrambling. If you haven't done something above tree line before, get nervous seeing steep drop offs/on ridge lines, or you aren't fully acclimated to the altitude, I would be cautious and think about something less intense. If, on the other hand, you are in decent shape, don't get easily intimidated by heights, and feel confident in your ability to securely place your hands and feet at ~12,000 feet, go for it! It's really not so bad and offers BEAUTIFUL 360 views of the territory below. The hike itself is also really fun, challenging, and offers a wide array of different experiences and a lot of elevation gain in an afternoon."
45,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful trail, the views from the top are magnificent. There are a couple sections of the trail that are calf burners but most of it is a nice leisurely hike. It took me just shy of 5 hours to go up and down. I would definitely recommend it."
46,2018-06-24,['hiking'],"I completed the hike on 06/20. Although the trail is only 8.5 miles for round trip, plan around 8-hr. The trail is not always gaining elevation and it becomes very difficult towards the end. The final portion of the trail towards the summit is built on loose shale and there are multiple trails which are not always leading to the peak. I got lost in some false trails. It is better and safe to follow or ask someone in front of you. I would recommend hiking poles and tough shoes for this trail. The view is fantastic though."
47,2018-06-06,['hiking'],"I love this hike. The end is deceptively hard, especially when there's still patches of snow, but the views and experience of sitting on the top of the Wasatch front are well worth it. This is probably the most iron-rich soil I've seen so far in Salt Lake, and the flowers are multi-colored and pretty. There's some nice wildlife sometimes too."
48,2018-05-20,['hiking'],"This is a great hike but its rated as a hard one for a reason. This is one of the harder summits Ive done, since it climbs so fast. Make sure to bring lots of water, whatever the weather. The scenery and wildlife are great though."
49,2017-12-24,['hiking'],Despite not being terribly long this hike was still relatively hard due to the constant gain and loss of elevation. I went in august and it was still very cold in the morning and at the top so a light windbreaker would be recommended.
50,2017-12-11,['trail running'],Favorite Peak of the year! We were grateful to have our poles and traction for the ascent and descent from the valley before going up to the peak. It was a great trail from start to finish and enjoyable to run. - Side note: do not start this trail at the paved trailhead.  Be sure to head right on the jeep road about a half mile for the actual trailhead
51,2017-10-24,['hiking'],"great hike. definitely not as hard as some people have made it out to be. if you're used to hiking peaks this one won't be bad at all. if you go in October, take hunting orange if you go after the hunt has started as there will be hundreds of hunters there. also if there is any chance of snow take the proper gear because it will be icy."
52,2017-10-20,[''],Beautiful hike. Made it to the top despite the snow. Poles and microspikes were the key this time of year!
53,2017-09-05,['hiking'],Incredibly beautiful with challenging dynamic terrain. Make sure to get an early start though. It gets hot.
54,2017-09-02,['hiking'],"Challenging, even grueling at times, but worth doing - for that very reason. It was pretty hazy in all directions for us, so the views from the top could have been better. The mountain itself isn't as pretty as other mountains, e.g. Timp with its cirques, lakes, and waterfalls - there is none of that here.
I didn't even drink 3L of water, but it was under 50 degrees for most of our hike. On hotter days you would definitely need more water - there is none on the trail for filtering. No lakes, no rivers, not a trickle.
I wouldn't describe the first three and a half miles as ""easy"" - there are plenty of ups and downs and some of it is quite steep. But it does get particularly steep after the saddle between North Peak and the false summit, and then it's all basically loose shale between the false and true summits. As noted by other reviewers, it is particularly important to stay on or right next to the ridge on this last part of the hike. There are often two or three trails that weave around the ridge in this last section, and for the most part it doesn't matter which one you take, but there is one spot about 2/3 of the way between the false and true summits where there is clearly a well-worn trail that dips down the west face a bit - don't go that way, even though it's obvious that plenty of people have. Someone in our group got stuck there for about 20 minutes. It's all loose rock with very little to hold on to, and there is a perfectly safe trail up on the ridge.
Trekking poles might take some strain off your knees, but you don't need them to complete the hike. Just some decent footwear."
55,2017-08-28,['hiking'],"Fun, challenging hike. It is steep and offers little shade but well worth the effort. Be prepared with water, snacks, sunscreen and of course a camera."
56,2017-08-20,['hiking'],"This was a great hike. It is very technical so a lot of my time was spent looking at where my next footstep would be. The scenery was very nice, but not quite as nice as other hikes in the area. Those two reasons combined gave it a 4 star rating. It was a very nice hike though. Plenty challenging, not too crowded, and very spectacular views at the end. I'd definitely do it again, but I still enjoy Timpanogos more because I can enjoy being in the mountains without worrying about losing my footing on every step."
57,2017-08-19,['hiking'],"I think people expect this to be harder than it is because it's the highest in the Wasatch. The steepness getting to the false summit and difficulty navigating the ridge make this challenging for sure. Poles are essential for the false summit climb but I found them burdensome on the ridge. All the advice to ""stay the ridge"" means, on the ascent, there are a few paths that take you away from the ridge but still toward the summit. In general, stay on the path closest to the ridge. Sometimes it was physically easier to walk on the ridge than the path as well. Overall this was a fun little hike!"
58,2017-08-06,['hiking'],"This hike is everything that is advertised....beautiful views and a tough grinding hike with no shade to the summit.  A mountain goat decided to people watch and hung out all day just below the summit.  A couple of points I'd like to emphasize:
1) I carried 4L of water and used them all and had to borrow from others in my group.  Remember you aren't just losing water, you are losing electrolytes.  I didn't bring any electrolytes and paid the price.
2) The rocks on the scramble to the summit are SHARP.  One guy in my group cut his hand badly and we saw another hiker with a gash in his leg.  Gloves are a good idea.  On the ridge, if you trip or even drop a knee, your chances of getting sliced are high.  Go slow.
3) The trail is STEEP with loose rocks and gravel.  Chances of getting all the way down without falling are low even if you are young and sure footed.  I saw plenty of 20 somethings fall on their butts.  Trekking poles will help a lot.
4) Don't go out onto the rockslides, even if it looks like a trail heads that direction.  Stay on the ridge. The rock slides are just on the verge of sliding down the mountain.  It is a quick way down (and over a cliff), but you will not be coming back up.
5) The trail is listed as 8.7 miles...actual walking distance is probably closer to 12 miles.  There are lots of tight switchbacks/scramble that may not be properly accounted for.  
6) Enjoy!  The vast majority of hikers we talked to (I was with teen age daughters who talk to everyone) were first timers...leading me to think that there aren't a lot of people who hike it a second time.  So enjoy it while you are there."
59,2017-08-04,['backpacking'],"7.29.2017 | 25lb backpack | Recommend: Sunscreen, Long Pants, Trekking Poles

This was our first time exploring Mt Nebo and holy smokes it's strenuous! This isn't an exceptionally long hike but due to the elevation gain and steep peaks, it's easily an all day trip. If you're carrying a light pack or hike quickly, a 1/2 day would be sufficient. I suggest long pants for the meadow portions as the trail is narrow and lined with thick (and thorny) bushes.

Once you emerge from the brush, the ridgeline is exposed and has sweeping 360 views. The majority of our packed 6L water was consumed while on the ridge. The steepest part of the trail is summiting the false and actual peak and trekking poles were a must-have for the way down. Loose shale covers the ridges making them slippery, so a lot of people climbed up using their hands and scooched down on their butts.

The most important advice I can give is *STAY ON THE RIDGE!* Stay to the high points, follow the ridge and do not be fooled into thinking the trail goes to either side (hello cliffs)! I got my GSD and I into a life threatening situation by not following the ridge. The trail loses itself quite a few times to the peak but stay high and make it alive.

Overall, a beautiful and grandiose hike that is worth doing once! Just make sure you're prepared, seriously!"
60,2017-07-30,['hiking'],Fun hike! Lot of wild flowers in bloom and no snow to speak of. Last mile is a real work out.
61,2017-07-25,['hiking'],"Trail was dry snow has melted, lots of wild flowers in bloom watch for afternoon T-showers. I would recommend early start ."
62,2017-07-19,['trail running'],"Good trail, three small down trees on trail."
63,2017-07-16,[''],So beautiful- tons of wild flowers. The trail obviously gets tougher the closer to the summit as many places are narrow and on loose rock falls. Take lots of water and plan the whole day in and out. The views are amazing.
64,2017-07-15,['hiking'],"Fun hike, beautiful wildflowers this time of year and a good view. A steep hike and pretty strenuous but worth it!"
65,2017-06-19,['hiking'],"Great hike.  No water.  Limited shade.    Only made it 2.5 miles towards the peak before we had to turn around due to slippery terrain.  Snow run off created mud.   Plenty of snow on the top of Mnt Nebo.     Best to wait until mid/end of July for all snow to melt.  

Nothing but beautiful view after view"
66,2017-04-13,['backpacking'],Great for Backpacking. Summer into Early Fall is best
67,2016-11-25,['hiking'],"Did this hike a couple weeks ago. It was great to hike with virtually no one else on the trail, but snow and mud made the hike tough. The ground was frozen when we started, but as the day went on it became muddy. Also, there was ice in several spots. When we started ascending the first peak, we saw a herd of about 30 mountain goats. Going was tough on the peaks because there was about 3-6 inches of slippery snow. Definitely a work out getting up/down the peaks - even more so with the snow. Brought 4 liters of water and ended up using 2.5-3, although we weren't hiking in the heat."
68,2016-10-16,['hiking'],"Did this hike yesterday and it is no joke. My GPS put it at 12.27 miles from the first parking lot to the peak and back. The 8.7 may be as the crow flies, but doesn't account for the valleys you will dip into on the trail, which will give you about 4500 total ascended feet.   Because of the up and down nature of the hike, and the steepness, expect the trip back to take just as long as the hike in. 

There is an upper parking lot with a toilet, or you can drive straight to the trail head and park. 

There are about three stages of this hike. The first will take you through the woods until you are in the valley of North Peak. Then you will hike up the valley to a short spine.  The second phase will take you around the far side of North Peak until you reach the saddle.  The third stage will take you from the saddle, over the peak you see from the saddle then to the final peak.   

Most of this hike is extremely exposed.  A storm front was moving in yesterday, making some of the faces precarious, and cold.  In the summer I expect it is very hot on this trail.  Bring gloves regardless of the time of year to help with the slate rocks at the end, they are sharp!

As of yesterday there was some snow on the final approach and it was sketchy/slippery.  I expect it will get more snow covered from this point on and would advise spikes and poles for the top."
69,2016-10-12,['hiking'],"This is a fun hike. Expect it to take up most of your day, it took our group 5-6 hours or so for the hike. I took 3 liters of water, 4 probably would have been nice, but 3 worked. The hike has an amazing view, but it can be a bit discouraging once you hit the first peak. There is a saddle that you descend, then ascend to get to the higher peak, and by then most of our group was a bit fatigued, but it is worth it. It's a good hike overall."
70,2016-08-16,['hiking'],"I loved this hike and will definitely be doing it again next year!  

We started from the parking area on Mona Pole Road and it was 8.7 miles out and back for us.  The first 2 miles is nice with some short steep sections that aren't too bad and long flat areas in between.  Then there is a fairly steep part that climbs up to a ridge where you can view Mona and much of the valley below.  After you hike the ridge, gaining some elevation as you do, the trail is mostly downhill to wolf pass which is around the 3.5 mile mark.  After that it's a steep, loose climb to the north peak.  At the north peak, the trail gets a bit more serious. The ridge between the north peak and the base of Nebo peak itself can be a bit narrow and steep on both sides.  It deserves some caution. The final climb to the peak is steep again and not a place you'd want to trip and fall off the trail.  The view from the summit is amazing, as you'd expect, and definitely makes the hike worthwhile.  Be careful as you leave the summit not to stay on the ridge too long or you'll end up missing the preferred trail down and end up coming down a scary, loose, steep section like we did.

As others have stated, bring plenty to drink.  I brought 4 liters and it was about right for me. The hike is exposed without a lot of shade cover and there aren't any springs or streams to refill at (not in August, anyway).  Gloves would be a good idea as the rocks near the top are sharp.  I ended up cutting both of my hands on them.  We saw around 75 people, so either we picked an unusually busy weekend, or the trail is getting more popular.  Many of those were using walking sticks to help with the steep downhill sections which are hard on the knees.  Since it was brought up in earlier reviews, I actually think this is easier than Timp, but I do better on steep hikes than I do on long hikes and Timpanogos takes me 10 to 12 hours to complete so it's a lot of time on my feet.  Timp is prettier though with more meadows and flowers to enjoy."
71,2016-07-11,['hiking'],"Awesome hike. Yes, very steep during portions of the trip, but worth it."
72,2016-07-10,[''],"this is a tough hike. trails climb up and down. there is a part where you are hiking a thin Trail with shell rock under your feet.
we didn't make it to the top, by choice. not worth the risk. on the day we went all the other hikers did not make it. there were ten in total hikers this day. so not busy. this is bear country so be prepared. pretty warm in june. so water is BIG!!!
wild flowers in full bloom and streams still full. nice water fall at the end of the trail. but to get to the top there is no trail.
views spectacular and worth it."
73,2016-07-07,[''],"It was an amazing hike, one of the hardest I have ever done.  Of the 4 of us who started, only 2 of us completed the hike.  The last mile and a half or so was completely brutal with the incline and having to scramble up the rocks.  This hike was completely worth it but I am not sure I will do it again."
74,2016-07-06,['hiking'],"This is a short but tough hike that is definitely worth it!  The first 3.5 miles from trailhead to Wolf Pass was pretty typical, but the last mile from Wolf Pass to the tallest point (which is the middle peak, not the north peak) is where the real challenge starts!  1300’ of elevation in under a mile is a pretty aggressive incline!  Depending on how you define ""kid-friendly"", that description of this trail is debatable.  My 16yr old daughter hiked this with me and did just fine, but she's also done other peaks with me in preparation for something like this.  I also think it's debatable on whether or not Nebo is easier than Timp.  After doing Timp three times previously, I'd say Nebo is harder due that last mile of intense elevation gain plus the class 2 scramble with quite of bit of exposure on both sides!  In comparison, the only sketchy part on Timp is passing through the short section called the Chute, otherwise it’s just a long steady trek of 7 miles to the top.  Looking at our stats, it took us just as long to do 4.5 miles each way on Nebo as it did for us to do 7.2 miles each way on Timp (4 hrs up, 3 hrs down), so I’m curious to know what made Timp harder for those who say Nebo was easier?  ...too bad AllTrails doesn’t provide a comment feature on trail reviews to facilitate a conversation or connection with other users!"
75,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"Trailhead by 7:30, garmin 235 put it at 9.1 miles in just under 5 hours with lots of breaks.  I went with my brother and 8 year old son.  It's steep, and the trails diverge in many different areas the closer you approach the false peak and Mt Nebo. We had about 10 liters of water between three of us and used nearly all of it.  This is an exposure hike and I would recommend going early, hats and sunscreen.  The peak at Nebo had, to our dismay,  no marker!   There is no box with paper and pen to chronicle our adventure and we hope that summit post or Wasatch hiker can organize efforts to get this done:). The ride up from Santaquin is beautiful and the ride down thru Payson,  equally nice. There were 7 other hikers that made it to peak this day, 8 year old was the youngest and a 55 year old with his sister and brother-in-law.  Overall,  a great hike in Utah County that is relatively unknown to many, and we certainly recommend."
76,2016-07-05,['hiking'],so great but so hard
77,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"I'm glad to have marked this one off my bucket list...but it is NOT one I will do again! It took us about 7 hours, starting before 7:00 AM. We met several people on the trail, but only one or two who had ever hiked the peak before. It does not seem like a hike people want to repeat! The first half is beautiful, through woods and meadows. But the two peaks at the end are BRUTAL. And the descent is hard on the knees, as it is very steep."
78,2016-06-26,['hiking'],This was an excellent hike. It is steep for good portions: this is one you need to prepare for. Bring plenty of water.= and get an early start to avoid the heat.
79,2015-10-29,['hiking'],"Loved this hike! We left around 1130 and started our climb in t shirts and ended up putting on as many layers as we could because of the chilly wind. It's a climb so be ready for great views and a good leg workout. 

There was snow up the top and the trail was a little icy. I'd recommend this hike to anyone!"
80,2015-10-16,['hiking'],This was a wonderful hike!  There are places that get quite steep but I really enjoyed this hike!
81,2015-10-15,['hiking'],Love this trail!
82,2015-07-03,['hiking'],"Some reviews have undersold the intensity of this trail. It isn't easier than Timp, but it is a shorter trail. The vertical is pretty intense because you cover 3800 in 4.4 miles, but a good portion (a mile or so) is flat or downhill so it is really 3800 in 3.4 miles. The scramble at the top is also pretty intense. We had a 14 year old and a 16 year old in our group. The 14 year old struggled and the 16 year old did fine. The views are great, and the trail is very scenic."
83,2015-04-07,['hiking'],"My favorite trail system, by far, in the state of Arkansas.  The system gives you a little bit of everything, but stay to the North Trail.  It takes you around each side of the mountain, gives you a good view of the entire small range, and the topography is just breathtaking.  A great physical challenge for even the most adept hikers, the up and down will really get your heart going!  The views of Lake Dardanelle on the Northwest side are just gorgeous.  So underrated. 4 trips there and counting."
84,2014-10-26,['hiking'],"What a great hike! The grade is steep in some places, especially ascending the summit after the saddle. Plenty of wildflowers all throughout the summer. Don't expect to finish this in the ""expected"" 5.5 hours. Took our group 7. Great views from the top and from the saddle. BEWARE - NO WATER ALONG THE TRAIL, so pack all the water you will need. I summited with my lab too, so you can take the pooch along if they have well developed pads. Last mile is loose shale, and will cut up the paws if they are rookies to hiking."
85,2014-06-30,['hiking'],Completed this on 6/28/2014. Took us 7 hours walking at a leisurely pace. All snow is avoidable and I was able to comfortably summit in my Chaco sandals. Great Hike! Highly recommended. Relatively easy summit compared to other Wasatch Peaks although the last ~1/2 mile on the summit ridge does have some scrambling with exposure.
86,2014-06-21,['trail running'],"We loved this hike! There was still a bit of snow but we just hiked through or around it and it was melting fast. We started at the monument trailhead. It was easy to find. We went on the Mt. Nebo Scenic Loop from Payson. Once you get to the top of the loop (driving) and start back down, you will see the trailhead on your right. There are bathrooms there. We took the dirt road immediately to the right and went about 1/2 mile to a small parking area. It starts off kind of steep and you follow an old barb wire fence for a while. We were doing a trail run and had to hike quite a bit on the way up. You hike right below the North Peak and I wish we would have taken the time to summit that one also but we just stayed on the trail below the peak. The trail is very easy to follow until you get up into the rocks. You hike through a meadow and start up towards the middle peak. The rocks start right around the bottom of the hill going to the middle peak. It is very rocky and the rock is loose and a little dangerous. We had one in our group that decided to stay at the middle peak. My other friend and I went on to the South Peak and signed the Summit Book. It is very rocky (loose, unsteady rocks) and we were on hands and feet for some of it. The views were amazing! I wouldn't take little kids to the top of the Peak. There are some spots that you could fall a long way with one slip of the foot. My GPS showed 9.2 miles. It took us about 3 hours to the South Summit and a total of 6 hours back to the car. We stopped for photos and also saw one other group of 3 firefighters from South Jordan and talked to them for a bit. They were just starting up the middle peak as we were coming down. We ran almost the whole way back down and had a wonderful time! If you are thinking about doing this hike, do it! You will love it and be so glad you accomplished something amazing! It is so fun to look up at the Peak and know you were up there!"
87,2014-01-20,[''],One of my favorite trails to run or hike!
88,2013-09-02,['hiking'],"This was a hike I'd wanted to do for a long time. It was a pretty straight-forward hike, however, the steep ascent just after Wolf Pass should not be underestimated. The hike proved more difficult than we'd expected and one of our group got altitude sickness coming down for which it took us as long to get down as it did to go up. According to our GPS unit, our hike was 9 miles in 9 hours. Pretty spectacular views from the top. A full review of our trip is documented on our troop blog."
89,2013-08-04,['hiking'],"Fantastic Beauty, and relatively easy when compared to the long haul up Timpanogos!  Plus, its the highest of the Wasatch, so a definite for anyone."
90,2013-06-22,['hiking'],Great trail for a fall hike. It is fairly easy with a bit of steep climbing near the end of the trail. This trail is nice because it takes out a lot of the elevation gain.
91,2013-04-24,['hiking'],"A little scary at the end on the little ridge.  And not as pretty as hiking Timp, but a lot less crowded.  A fun hike."
92,2013-04-17,['hiking'],"This was an outstading hike.  The trail is very well kept and the views are always amazing.  As you start crossing over the saddle to start the main climb up it can look a little intimidating.  You just start tackling all the little switchbacks and before you know it you have reached the false summit.  At that point you want to be a little more sure footed, the rock is loose and in couple of spots you have to scramble around a couple of cliff areas.  It is well worth the hike!!!
"
93,2011-09-15,['hiking'],"A long hike but worth it.  Once you climb up from Wolf Pass, the trail eventually turns into flat loose rock.  Could have footing issues if done in wet weather, which we almost did."
94,2010-08-01,['hiking'],"Moderate to strenuous trails. We stayed in one of the cabins at this park. Very nice and comfy. One of the trails we went on was pretty strenuous, it was all rock stairs and thank goodness we were going down..lol. Of course we did have to come back up, but we went up a different way and it was gradual. The other trails were moderate.  Very beautiful place."
