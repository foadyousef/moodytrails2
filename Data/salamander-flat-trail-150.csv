1,2018-06-18,[''],trail is open now. did it on a Thursday and only saw 2 other groups. not crowded at all. very pretty. lots of flowers and butterflies that kept my 2 year old interested. lots of little ups and downs but nothing very steep so he was able to hike quite a lot himself. we weren't sure at first if it was going to be 2.64 miles round trip or each way but it is definitely 2.64 each way. we hiked about 2 miles in then turned around because 5 miles total is a lot for my kid and our dog. but the hike itself was very manageable. lots of shady spots too.
2,2018-05-16,[''],"road to get to this trail was closed today. could only park 1.5 miles away. didn't want to walk that far with my 2 year old to get to the trail so did pine hollow instead. not trying to give this trail a bad review cause we intend to do it later but check road is open first if you're planning to go soon. updated to add: found out road is closed until ""late May, early June"" so keep in mind most trails in this canyon will be inaccessible until June each year, even if they are perfectly hikeable by April or May."
3,2018-05-10,['hiking'],We ended up on this trail when we got lost. It had wonderful views and tons of wildlife.
4,2018-04-05,['hiking'],Itâ€™s a nice short easy hike. I take this route often on excursions up Timpanogos before the road opens to turn it into a loop. Up the road and down via salamander flat and pine hollow.

6,2017-12-09,['hiking'],Hiked about southwestern half of the trail on a loop trail from the Pine Hollow Trailhead. Good trail with limited views of the surrounding mountains because of the trees even with all of the leaves gone from the Aspens
7,2017-09-19,['hiking'],I would rate this as an easy hike. saw a few deer and a moose... pretty cool
8,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"It was a pretty easy hike. The views were great! Watch out for horses, bikers, and dirt bikes."
9,2017-06-02,['hiking'],Took my nephew on this hike today. It was way easy and had pretty views but salamander flats wasn't as cool as we thought it would be. It's a nice hike tho for young children but I probably won't ever hike it again.
10,2017-05-24,['hiking'],SUPER easy hike with insanely beautiful views.
11,2017-04-26,[''],"We went there 22 April 2017. It is a fairly easy trial. Some portion of the trial is muddy at the time, but is OK to handle. We liked it!"
12,2016-06-18,['hiking'],It was moderate with bugs and ants and beetles and bikes and dirt bikes and wild flowers.
13,2016-06-12,['hiking'],"Good hike with some wonderful views. However, too close to traffic noise and the road at times."
14,2016-05-30,['hiking'],Awesome beginner trail. Great for hiking or running.
