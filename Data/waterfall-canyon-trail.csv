1,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'rocky']",really enjoyed this hike. we went early and were the only ones there for a while. 
2,2019-09-01,['hiking'],"This hike is definitely not hard, I could see moderate. HIGH traffic all days of the week. Don’t go on unless you don’t mind a busy trail. "
3,2019-08-30,['hiking'],"Great hike! Pretty steep climb so make sure you’ve got proper shoes and lots of water. Overall, just the right length for the climb. Rewarding treat at the top with the cool waterfall!"
4,2019-08-27,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Great hike, starts off kinda slow but then takes you straight up for the second half. Cool waterfall and the top with even more fun climbing and great views. 
"
5,2019-08-24,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Enjoyed this hike while in Utah on a business trip. The waterfall was beautiful!
6,2019-08-16,['hiking'],I’m a little put off by all the rules and regulations... “Cool drinks for paying customers only” kind of takes away from the beauty of the hike. It’s a difficult trail and I love the waterfall at the end.
7,2019-08-15,"['hiking', 'rocky']",We tried trail running up to the waterfall and it was too rocky for us but overall it was a great hike.
8,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"More moderate than hard based on the short distance, but pretty at the end."
9,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"Steep, some scrambling, high traffic, great waterfall at the end."
10,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Literally as good as it gets- one of the Best hikes I have ever been on. The pictures of this trail and waterfalls do not do it justice... completely, absolutely, totally worth the effort you have to put in."
11,2019-08-02,['hiking'],Awesome trail! Minor tree coverage. Far worth the misty falls and the view from the top. Slick in the snow months. 
12,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"I went on this trail multiple times because I love it so much. It starts out pretty flat, but the end of the trail, near the waterfall, is very Rocky! Bring lots of water and sunscreen. There is a large chunk of the hike in the sun, so it is easy to get dehydrated. I saw a few lizards but no snakes."
13,2019-07-27,['hiking'],Good trail that works the leg muscles for sure. Beautiful scenery along the way. My only complaint is all the dog poop. 
14,2019-07-24,['hiking'],"Did this hike on July 15th, 2019.  Left the trailhead about 8 am.  Not too crowded.   Not too hot yet.  Good hike.  Definitely a little bit of a leg burner,  but  not too tough.   Very nice waterfall.   Absolutely worth the effort. "
15,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
16,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'rocky']","Did the trail last wk around 6pm, very hot and lots of snakes around the gate. Once we got to the falls and cooled off it was nice till we heard a mountain lion scream from above the falls we think "
17,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",I recommend coming to waterfall canyon off of 29th trailhead lots of shade and get water before seeing the waterfall!! 
18,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",
19,2019-07-20,['hiking'],Lots of water at the waterfall
20,2019-07-17,['hiking'],great view. really steep
21,2019-07-16,['hiking'],Fun hike. Short but steep. The waterfall is great though. Very crowded. 
22,2019-07-16,"['hiking', 'rocky']",This trail is tough at the beginning. There is no shade for the first mile or so and it’s bland as far as the surrounding area. After the first mile you meet a stream that is surrounded by trees. The trees provide shade as you follow the stream up to the water fall. 
23,2019-07-16,['hiking'],"Did this hike for a second time this summer to watch the sunset and It was the most beautiful view. Got really close to the waterfall to cool off and it drenched me, however, it felt so nice on the way down. "
24,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",
25,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"The beginning is boring because it goes along the Great Western Trail, but once you get into the trees, it is shaded and beautiful. There are several places that you cross over the stream. it is correctly marked as hard because of the steepness. although the water fault is spectacular, it was a little disappointing that there was no pool of water that you could wade in."
26,2019-07-11,['hiking'],Absolutely worth it to see the waterfall!
27,2019-07-10,['hiking'],"Did this trail with some friends on a sunny Thursday morning. Not very much shade the first mile or so. It’s a steady incline the whole way up but the waterfall at the end is beautiful and helps you cool off. Warning: we did see a rattlesnake at the very beginning of the trail, but that was the only one we saw. "
28,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"Only the slightest water on the trail, feet stayed dry the whole way up."
29,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"LOVE this trail. It is steep at parts, but is totally doable (my kids have been doing it for a couple years now (6&10). This waterfall is seriously amazing, I especially love it when it’s frozen!"
30,2019-07-03,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",
31,2019-06-29,['hiking'],Gorgeous waterfall. Steep hike but very doable if you’re not in a rush. 
32,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Good trail! You do get to walk through some water so waterproof shoes will save some discomfort. It does get pretty rocky towards the end and is a little steep. However numerous kids are on the trail so it can be done! The waterfall was worth it! Beautiful pictures. 
33,2019-06-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']","This wasn’t an easy trail but was very doable! Rocky and steep at points but very fun and scenic . Saw quite a few kiddos on the way up so don’t be *too* swayed by the “difficult” rating, but keep in mind it is slippery at times. The waterfall at the end is amazing and so, so worth the hike! 10/10 would hike again. "
34,2019-06-27,['hiking'],great hike. has some good climb to it and the waterfall at the top is amazing. 
35,2019-06-27,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Though this trail is fairly short, it is also a bit tough. The first half is pretty easy and flat, but the last half is quite rocky and steep. This year, with it being a wet winter, the trail was covered in water for many parts so bring shoes that can get wet! This being said, the waterfall is well worth the hike! It is one of my favorite hikes in the area! Especially when the waterfall is flowing like it is right now."
36,2019-06-26,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",
37,2019-06-25,['hiking'],This is beautiful end of June 2019 and we still had a ton of runoff so the waterfall was beautiful totally worth the hike.  At times we were walking through a stream as well due to Roman off.  This is NOT an easy hike but worth it.  Our little Yorkie did it too but he is a super active dog.  We heard there were a possibility of snakes but we didn’t see any. Super fun hike a must do!!
38,2019-06-23,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! Hiking by the fast flowing water was outstanding. Lots of unmarked forks for first time to area. The views of valley are stunning! Lots of shade. Will head back soon. 
39,2019-06-22,['hiking'],Tough but fun!
40,2019-06-21,['hiking'],"If you just need a shirt but intense work out, this is your trail! The first 1/4-1/2 of the trail is unexposed, so no shade. Dogs love the year round creek it follows too! "
41,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Beautiful trail there's so much wildlife aroun plenty of shade til you get to the waterfall but it is beautiful!
42,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'private property', 'rocky']",
43,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'private property', 'rocky', 'scramble']","harder trail, difficulty is because of steepness and scrambling up rocks at the top. beautiful trail. the waterfall and scenic views make it all worth it."
44,2019-06-15,['hiking'],Harder as you get to the top but beautiful!
45,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'private property', 'rocky', 'scramble']","AMAZING water flow right now! Probably one of the coolest waterfalls I’ve hiked in Utah! Definitely hard and my Apple Watch clocked this as a 4.29 mile hike round trip. My 5 year old did this, but I had to carry her through the streams and up to the top, I wouldn’t rate this as a kid friendly hike. "
46,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Great trail with a rewarding finish. There are some parts that have water over the trail, so your shoes will get wet. "
47,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
48,2019-06-09,[''],"Great hike, lots of water this year."
49,2019-06-08,"['backpacking', 'rocky']",A little difficult but well worth it. Highly recommend it! 
50,2019-06-08,['hiking'],Very beautiful trail! It’s definitely worth it!
51,2019-06-08,['hiking'],"very nice trail, though very wet right now"
52,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Beautiful but steep hike. The waterfall is flowing heavily and just stunning. Great views of Ogden and is well worth the effort! 
53,2019-06-05,['hiking'],Tough steep hike with lots of boulders and water this time of season. Rewarding finish. Five-year-old was able to make it up and back with a handhold.
54,2019-06-05,['hiking'],"Went on this hike last night and loved it! Trail was decent. Less hikers when we began at 5:30, got pretty crowded on the way down about 7:00."
55,2019-06-03,[''],"Awesome day hiking to the waterfall from 27th street. Being a Saturday,  many people on the trail. only saw one rattlesnake.  "
56,2019-06-03,[''],This is one of our favorite trails. We try to do it 3 days a week.  We take our 3 small dogs and they love it.  We have noticed a lot of poop on the trail lately so please clean up after your dogs.
57,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'private property', 'rocky', 'washed out']",
58,2019-06-02,['hiking'],Tough hike...but worth it.  Great waterfall...solid trail mostly.  A lot of rock hoppin though.  Enjoy!
59,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",
60,2019-06-01,[''],Loved the water fall! It was hard but worth it. Bring your water shoes!
61,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"Super amazing, had a blast heading up and back, only took a couple hours including rest stops. Very rocky half way up, fun tree blocking the way just before the big rocks. Amazing end goal."
62,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"This is one of my all time favorite hikes! The view it gives of Ogden is breathtaking. And with the view being to the west it makes it a gorgeous sunset hike. With the wet spring the falls have so much water making them even more majestic than normal. The top is always very chilly with the mist from the falls. If you’re hiking in the morning the top will also be covered in shade so if get cold easily and want to spend much time at the top, you may want a jacket just for that part of the hike."
63,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"The waterfall is beautiful right now, nice hike fairly steep parked behind the university to make it longer, seen a big gopher snake. "
64,2019-06-01,[''],"I Love the hike to the water fall. It's a consistently steep incline,  but once you reach the overgrowth, it gets easier."
65,2019-05-31,"['private property', 'rocky']",
66,2019-05-29,[''],The trail and waterfall were beautiful. A must see. Some areas are a bit difficult to climb and a tree has fallen over the trail. 
67,2019-05-29,"['hiking', 'private property', 'rocky']",
68,2019-05-28,[''],"This is a great trail! It's fairly difficult towards the middle and stays that way until you reach the falls. There were a lot of kids hiking to the top so it's do able. we just took breaks and enjoyed the views. The falls are really pretty and had quite a bit of water flowing. The trail has water in quite a few spots, but not enough to get your feet wet. "
69,2019-05-28,[''],Hiked in mid May with my 9 year old and my two 7 year olds.  It was a particularly rainy spring and the run off was heavy. The water fall was pretty and mists coming from the bottom felt cool. The first half of the hike is on an exposed trail. Once the trail turns up the canyon it is under trees until it reaches the falls.  Will hike again!
70,2019-05-27,['hiking'],The waterfall is beautiful and flowing well. Great day with temps in the mid 50's and overcast most the day. Trail wet in spots.
71,2019-05-27,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'private property', 'rocky', 'scramble']","We hiked the waterfall canyon trail.  massive falls compared the the summer that I was here last.

This trail is well marked, traveled and relatively easy.

At the top we met some locals that mentioned heading to the top (offtrail) and to the stream/head of the waterfall then back down Malan (sp) to Taylor.

the scramble up and around was maybe more than the average person would want to do.

the full streams and all the water was amazing"
72,2019-05-26,['hiking'],"fun hike, lots of dogs, dog poop everywhere and so many people. The falls were so worth it!!! "
73,2019-05-26,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",Absolutely amazing waterfall.
74,2019-05-26,[''],"Awesome trail, I especially like the Pond Loop direction with the thick canopy that provides abundant shade and less traffic. "
75,2019-05-26,[''],Nice hike but the unleashed dogs and dog poop on the trail as well as numerous dog poop bags in the brush is distracting.  The waterfall is well worth the hike.
76,2019-05-26,[''],The falls are flowing well right now!
77,2019-05-25,['hiking'],"Great hike with beautiful views.  Mostly shaded once you reach the canyon.  A bit difficult for little legs (toddlers) unless they can be carried on a back.  Difficult push, but so worth the view at the top!"
78,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Enjoyable hike. Plenty of water this time of year. Fair amount of people on the trail during the rocky portions so be patient. Looks as if they are creating a new trail on the opposite side of creek that is not as rocky. View was worth the effort.
79,2019-05-20,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Perfect after work hike! Did it in an hour. Plus the waterfall and view make it all worth it. 
80,2019-05-18,"['muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
81,2019-05-16,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","this waterfall was BEAUTIFUL especially in the spring after all the snow melt! getting there was pretty tricky though. you are pretty much hiking through super rocky, slippery streams. would not recommend with young children. the trail signs also arnt very clear about where you are supposed to go. we ended up getting lost a few times and this 2 mile hike turned into almost a 6 mile hike. but worth the end view!!"
82,2019-05-15,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
83,2019-05-12,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'over grown', 'private property', 'rocky']",very very steep trail but worth the view at the end!!
84,2019-05-12,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","great trail. parts are muddy and some rocks slippery, but I would go now because the spring run off makes a bigger waterfall. so beautiful "
85,2019-05-11,[''],"We accidentally took 9 children 14 and under on this trail because the Waterfall Canyon via Ogden Park is marked ""moderate"" and "" kid friendly"" even though it is this exact hike with an extra mile or so of Gib's Loop at the beginning!!! We made it. It was definitely difficult but the waterfall at the end was worth it."
86,2019-05-10,['rocky'],Trail gets pretty rocky halfway up.  But had the falls all to myself for 45 minutes before I ever saw anyone else. So worth it!
87,2019-05-09,[''],great hike with a good incline.
88,2019-05-06,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","The river is overflowing some, making parts of the trail wet and muddy. But it’s gorgeous!"
89,2019-05-04,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'washed out']",great trail! some rough spots but fun short trail!
90,2019-04-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
91,2019-04-27,[''],great hike not too hard. amazing falls in late April
92,2019-04-25,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",Waterfall is very full and beautiful. Way up is wet and muddy. Lots of wobbly rocks. Quick hike. Waterfall is worth the not so great rocky trail.
93,2019-04-24,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Great hike. Steep and wet.
."
94,2019-04-23,"['hiking', 'muddy']",It’s a little wet at some parts but other than that is perfect weather for this right now
95,2019-04-23,[''],"Great trail for a quick workout with views.  There were some shot sections with shallow (0.5"") flowing water.  Well trafficked. I went near sunset, the low light lit up the falls nicely, and the surrounding mountains for the walk down."
96,2019-04-23,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Hiked earlier this week. Parts of the trail are quite muddy or with a little bit of running water (probably less than an inch), but it didn't prevent me from reaching the falls. Mild scrambling and there was not a clear trail at the end, so I just walked up through the water. I was glad I brought a jacket when the mist from the falls hit me!"
97,2019-04-20,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Probably not the best hike to take for the first time out in a while but was well worth it for the spectacular waterfall at the end! Fairly steep and rocky all the way. Wet and muddy at times and a little bit of scrambling. Not much shade for the first part along the Bonneville trail but once you get into the canyon there is. An hour up and a little less on the way down. I would definitely do again for a quick challenging hike.
98,2019-04-20,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",awesome trail well worth it for the waterfall. a bit too rocky for small kids
99,2019-04-19,[''],The views and waterfall were stunning. We went around 5pm on a Wednesday and it was not that busy. The trail wasn't too muddy and there was no snow. I'd definitely recommend this trail!
100,2019-04-19,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Started about 10:30am. Took about an hour to get to falls. Very rocky and steep last .5 mile with water running down some parts of trail. Well worth the view as lots of water flowing at this time.
101,2019-04-18,['hiking'],Uphill slog to a rad waterfall. Great views and blue skies. Awesome morning!
102,2019-04-14,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Awesome hike. it gets packed and it's not that hard. I would honestly say a moderate hike.
103,2019-04-06,[''],This is a great hike. Beautiful waterfall at the end and great view of the city.
104,2019-04-04,['hiking'],Went with my 7 year old son today and it was a beautiful hike. Waterfall was pretty. There’s still some ice on the way up so be careful. Especially when you are coming down.
105,2019-03-31,"['hiking', 'snow']","Did this trail for a second time last week. It’s a great hike, kind of steep, but a fun winter hike. Would recommend yak tracks, and a donation!"
106,2019-03-28,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']",The first 2/3 of the hike is steep and rocky but very doable. Today on the last 1/3 of the trail it was pretty snowy and slick I would definitely recommend spikes. We took our dog as well and the steep snowy part of the trail was tricky. Beautiful views throughout the hike and the waterfall is awesome!
107,2019-03-10,"['hiking', 'snow']",
108,2019-02-23,['hiking'],"Always a worthwhile trip. The trail was fresh, but well packed.  The section to the falls required microspikes or at least made travel a lot easier.  After coming out of the Canyon I opted for the upper trail to Taylor's Canyon.  Hadn't been that way in awhile.  Found the nice bench that TR Ranch put out on a nice overlook."
109,2019-02-17,"['hiking', 'snow']",
110,2019-02-03,['hiking'],"Hiked on 2/2 - spikes were definitely needed as half of the hike was a sheet of ice. (I would recommend poles if you have them)

The waterfall was cracking and breaking in a lot of places. If we don’t get colder weather again soon I am not sure how long the waterfall will be frozen."
111,2019-01-28,"['hiking', 'snow']",We had a great hike to the waterfall yesterday. My husband and I both carried toddlers on our backs. We used microspikes and hiking poles. Lots of ice/snow. Microspikes made a huge difference. The waterfall was gorgeous!
112,2019-01-26,['hiking'],Great hike and the waterfall is really cool to see while it’s frozen. Definitely bring spikes you will need them the whole trail is slippery and lots of it has ice.
113,2019-01-26,"['hiking', 'snow']","Great hike if you're short on time, a little steep in some areas but it makes for a great workout. The falls are frozen solid and absolutely gorgeous, be sure to bring some crampons or microspikes, the trail is quite slick right now."
114,2019-01-22,[''],One of my favorite hikes. some steep parts but overall pretty easy.
115,2019-01-21,['hiking'],"Pictures don’t do it justice, way more impressive in person! Micro spikes are a definite need throughout the trail! The last .5 mile is super steep... going up was easy in comparison to going down. Though some parts of going back down turned out to be super fun since we ended up using our butts as a sled"
116,2018-11-30,['hiking'],Our first hike in the area! Waterfall Canyon did not dissappoint. There is snow on the ground pretty much the last half mile which adds to the difficulty although it's still an easy enough hike. Falls are frozen pretty good at this point and make for great photos. Thank you to the property owners who let the public on their lands.
117,2018-10-28,['hiking'],First time to Ogden. We wanted to see a little bit of autumn since we live in the Vegas desert. We did this hike with my 10 year old daughter and 5 year old son. We loved it! Beautiful foliage and the 2nd half of the trail was covered in marigold colored leaves and red leaves. The last stretch what some what difficult for the 5 year old given the steepness and all of the rocks but he made it to the top. Great trail for dogs. Can’t wait to come back and bring your husky.
118,2018-10-18,['hiking'],These two 65 YOA flatlanders  from Kansas enjoyed the hike. It had some beautiful views.
119,2018-10-18,['hiking'],Beautiful falls
120,2018-10-15,[''],this was a great trail.
121,2018-09-29,[''],Great hike
122,2018-09-29,['hiking'],This hike is always a fun short hike to do! It gets you out of the house and gets some cardio in with the incline. Plus at the end you can see over the Ogden valley and not to mention the waterfall! The best time to go is once the snow is melting because the rub off makes the waterfall huge! It’s beautiful! You’ll enjoy it for sure!
123,2018-09-29,[''],"Even in the fall there is actually an impressive waterfall at the end of the trail.  Definitely a hiking trail.  The last half is shaded.  Great trail over a lunch break or just after work.

Too many people are leaving their dog shit in small plastic bags along the trail.  Come on people!  Do you think that the city hires someone to cleanup after you and your k9?"
124,2018-09-21,[''],A well worn trail for rugged pace really it needs to be developed with camp sites.
125,2018-09-18,['hiking'],this started out as a very easy trail and you could run it until the last 3/4th mile where it goes from graded dirt to almost river bed like conditions of tons of basketball sized loose rocks and slippery boulders. route finding can be difficult at times but stick to the main trail and it's a fun hike.
126,2018-09-17,['hiking'],It was a bit of a challenge  since I had not hiked in 2 years. I loved the challenges though. the views made it all worth while. We wet our faces in the waterfall.
127,2018-09-15,['hiking'],great trail with rewarding view
128,2018-09-09,[''],Great quick and easy hike to a beautiful waterfall . Not much water this time but still pretty .
129,2018-09-07,[''],Love this trail!
130,2018-09-03,[''],Not a bad hike. This was only my 2nd time hiking after a 20 hyadisis. Won't do it again tomorrow but will do it again.
131,2018-09-02,[''],Loved the waterfall!
132,2018-08-26,['hiking'],Loved this hike! Not too hard but still a good workout! Waterfall was more of a trickle but still awesome.
133,2018-08-20,[''],"It's a perfect hike, but make sure you are prepared.  Bring water.  You have to be in decent shape."
134,2018-08-10,['hiking'],I did this hike yesterday around 1030am. The waterfall was pretty but I probably won’t do the hike again. For about 2/3 of the hike it’s pretty steep. There also aren’t many views or pretty things to look at along the way. Plus the creek along the trail had an unpleasant smell.
135,2018-08-10,['hiking'],Waterfall more of a trickle late summer. Great for a morning trail run.
136,2018-08-09,[''],"Nice hike, very rocky with few flat spots. Waterfall barely a trickle in mid-August. Still nice views of the town."
137,2018-08-03,[''],Gets easier every time. Takes 25-35 minutes to get up. Wear decent shoes. Waterfall is more of a trickle currently. Sunsets are nice with the smoke in the air.
138,2018-07-27,[''],"Sunday was pretty crowded, not the trails fault but a group of people brought up their ganster rap, who wants that kind of music on a hike?! You hike to enjoy stillness. 
maybe someone will read this and not be that person on a hike (:"
139,2018-07-25,[''],"Just finished this hikes.  This hike is HARD!!! It is steep and insanely rocky. If you have knee problems, or are not in moderate shape, don't do this hike.  There are pretty spots and views; this time of year the waterfall is nothing special."
140,2018-07-23,[''],Great hike but the lack of snow fall has made this waterfall a bit disappointing.  
141,2018-07-23,[''],"just visiting, small hike in the morning.  it was some loose rock and not much waterfall but some good views and still had fun"
142,2018-07-21,[''],Left at 8:00 in the morning and the weather was perfect. Trail wasn’t crowded. Took about an hour. The end of the trail was rocky but manageable. The waterfall was a little disappointing......not a lot of water coming over. Still a great hike!
143,2018-07-20,[''],"When I was younger I loved this hike, however, be prepared to have a lot of people around you."
144,2018-07-18,['hiking'],"Good hike if you dont have time to drive far from town. The beginning is fairly easy and mid way the trail gets very rocky.  I'm not sure if there is a real waterfall earlier in the year, but today, its was more of a trickle with a mist. The shade was nice in the July heat though :)"
145,2018-07-16,['hiking'],my son took me on this hike. It was a work out for me but I really enjoyed the scenery.
146,2018-07-15,['backpacking'],"Nice falls, was on all fours toward the end."
147,2018-07-14,['hiking'],Hiked this mid July and started around noon. Start of trail you are more exposed. Then shade for majority of trail. With a 1 and 2y/o we took our time due to heat. Scenery beautiful and would have appreciated a few more signs.
148,2018-07-12,[''],This is a favorite hike for our family. The waterfall is impressive. Try it in the winter if you haven’t! It’s a good workout and a fair climb but my young kids have all been able to do it.
149,2018-07-11,[''],"Beautiful hike! If you go in the morning you can avoid the afternoon/weekend rush, as well as the heat.  The trail has plenty of shade half way up."
150,2018-07-08,['hiking'],Great trail but a little too busy for my liking...
151,2018-06-30,['hiking'],streams. rocks. snakes. bees. wild berries. shade. waterfall. what's not to love?
152,2018-06-26,['hiking'],Had a pretty good time on this trail was a bit tougher then I expected at the beginning but once I hit the rocky area it got a lot easier for me!
153,2018-06-26,['hiking'],"This has always been one of my favorite hikes. Even though the trail is not terribly long, it is a pretty steady incline up to the waterfall. It is well shaded, making it a perfect hike for any time of day, and the falls at the top are nice and cool and absolutely lovely. The farther you go, the rockier and steeper the path gets, but with decent shoes or hiking sandals, it can be done within about two hours."
154,2018-06-20,[''],I love this hike. Trail is pretty easy to follow. Good workout. Lovely view. Towards the ends you have to deal with lots of rocks.
155,2018-06-18,['hiking'],"Decent hike, great view"
156,2018-06-18,[''],Beautiful hike! Me and my 11 yo and 8 yo did it with me. The 2nd half is steep but the waterfall is so worth it.
157,2018-06-15,['hiking'],"We hiked this on a very hot summer day.  We believe if we had done this in the early morning, we would feel differently.  A beautiful waterfall at the end, but for us, in the middle of July, it was hot and dusty but enjoyed the falls."
158,2018-06-14,['hiking'],"Super fun hike! My kids, ages 4 and 5 made the hike without any help but it was definitely challenging!"
159,2018-06-13,[''],Beautiful hike with great scenery!!! Pretty steep trail! My legs were screaming at me by the time we made it to the falls!!!
160,2018-06-13,[''],"Hot, bring water."
161,2018-06-13,[''],"Loved this trail. It was a bit difficult at times but the scenery was amazing and the waterfall was better than I expected, gorgeous! My nine year old and I made the journey in about an hour and a half."
162,2018-06-10,[''],It’s a good workout. Legs get burning when you have to step up several times on the second half of the trail.
163,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"Nice hike with a beautiful waterfall. The trail maintains a pretty good degree of ascent, but isn't overly demanding. The final portion is the most strenuous, but definitely worth the effort."
164,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"Good family hike with my wife, and children (18, 16, and 10). But don’t get fooled, it’s not for the out of shape. Passed several people I worried weren’t going to make it. This hike gets vertical very quickly and just before the waterfall, gets steep and slippery. Lots of people and almost as many dogs (please clean up after your dogs). Still worth it though, great views."
165,2018-06-08,[''],"beautiful day, great hike!"
166,2018-06-05,['hiking'],"Great first hike of the season, took our young daughter, she loved it."
167,2018-06-03,[''],So fun and great scenery!
168,2018-06-02,['hiking'],The most beautiful and physically brutal hike in all of Ogden! Great exercise and the best pay off visually!
169,2018-06-02,[''],Lots bigger than I imagined! Beautiful! Fun climb to the top.
170,2018-05-30,[''],"Awesome in winter with the falls all frozen, you need crampons on the way down though."
171,2018-05-28,['hiking'],Short hike great for family although the top section is very rocky and has some loose rock that can be slick.
172,2018-05-26,[''],"Good trail, little rocky and bigger steps at the top. Good for the family (not older grandparents though)."
173,2018-05-26,[''],"Did this trail with my little family today (Husband, 10 yr old son, 1 yr old daughter and myself). It was fun with lots of beautiful views! Watch out for them snakes though...we ran into one.
Def worth the hike up to the top. I would recommend beginning late afternoon / early evening so you can watch the sunset on the way back down. We will be going again for sure!!"
174,2018-05-25,[''],Perfect morning hike before it gets too hot midday. Definitely worth the slightly rocky terrain once you get to the falls. Will definitely do this hike again
175,2018-05-22,['hiking'],"Great hike for a late spring day. Elevation gain is 1259 feet, but the waterfall at the end of the trail is worth the climb.  Saw lots of dogs and people of all ages on the trail."
176,2018-05-19,[''],great trail for beginners or just getting back in shape after the winter!
177,2018-05-16,[''],"Beautiful, popular trail. It gets a little steep/rocky for the last third before the waterfall. I’d recommend going earlier in the day or week night to avoid large groups of people."
178,2018-05-15,[''],d do this at least once a year fun for all ages changes every year waterfall is always impressive
179,2018-05-14,['hiking'],"Nice steep uphill trail leading to impressive waterfall. Would suggest wearing hiking boots for safety. Hiking up along the water stream, gives perception of cool breeze"
180,2018-05-06,['hiking'],"Amazing hike. We started at the Gibbs Loop trail head off of 36th and went from there on up to the falls. My husband and I with our 4 kids (10,8,6,4). It was shaded almost the entire hike with just a few sections that were exposed. And with following along the water for the majority of the hike, it makes it all the more beautiful. 
There were a few steep/rocky sections where holding the 4yr old’s hand was required. But for the most part he was able to do it all."
181,2018-05-05,[''],I love this hike.
182,2018-05-02,['walking'],Was a very easy hike. Did it on Tuesday morning around 10am. The day was beautiful and the waterfall looked amazing. There was more people then I expected on a Tuesday. About 10 cars parked at the entrance.
183,2018-04-30,[''],"I loved this hike! You do change elevation quickly, there are a couple of strenuous parts where it is steep and if you aren't in shape is difficult, but doable. The waterfall at the top is beautiful, and you can take a nice dip in it to cool off! It's a great hike that overlooks Ogden."
184,2018-04-29,[''],
185,2018-04-22,['hiking'],Wonderful hike! Beautiful views! Great workout getting up to the waterfall. Can’t wait to do this again when the waterfall is frozen!
186,2018-04-21,[''],Hiked last Saturday. Really nice at top. Can have a picnic if you don't mind the dirt. This is the 2nd time I have done this hike.
187,2018-04-16,[''],"A bit rough and very steep in some spots. This is more a difficult than moderate trail if you're not a hiker. Plenty spots to stop and take a breather if needed. Lots of dogs on the trail and owners don't pick up after them, that was disappointing the smell and the mess. Overall an okay hike."
188,2018-03-09,['hiking'],I took this trail for a quick midday hike on my lunch break.  Was not disappointed.  The frozen waterfall was beautiful and melting a bit.  I got to see some nice sized chucks of ice break off during my stop.  It was still pretty snow/slush packed so I’m glad I brought my boot chains and poles.
189,2018-02-28,[''],So pretty. The frozen waterfall was gorgeous! Wear spikes for sure.
190,2018-02-28,['hiking'],"Short but sweet hike, moderate uphill the majority of the way but worth it for the waterfall."
191,2018-02-26,['hiking'],"Hiked this on 23 Feb after 6"" fresh snow. Crampons were a must. Frozen waterfall even prettier than expected."
192,2018-02-17,['hiking'],Did this with my three year old. She loved the frozen waterfall. She thought it was Elsa's castle.
193,2018-02-17,['hiking'],"Great hike up the mountain. Gets a little icy and rocky toward the top, but the frozen waterfall was amazing!!"
194,2018-02-04,[''],Great hike. the frozen waterfall was awesome.
195,2018-02-01,['hiking'],"My siblings and I did this not to long ago, loved it! It was amazing and the frozen waterfall was one of the coolest things I've seen. Make sure to wear good shoes with lots of grip still plenty of snow."
196,2018-01-27,['hiking'],Fun for the kids. Decently strenuous
197,2018-01-22,['trail running'],Fun little short hike. Hardly any ice. The trail was pretty well snow packed. You will want Yak Tracks. The frozen waterfall is gorgeous!
198,2018-01-20,['hiking'],"I did this hike on Jan 13. It was clear trail up to the first bridge then the trail was covered in ice from there on up. 
I did the whole hike up to the top of the waterfall with out spikes on my shoes, definitely would of been helpful, and if you have them they are recommended. But like I said I didn't and I did just fine. Slipped a couple time coming down but luckily nothing bad. 

Always a perfect and fairly easy hike, all seasons of the year!"
199,2018-01-16,['hiking'],"Amazing view of Ogden and the waterfall is beautiful!! Steeper than I thought it would be especially close to the top, spikes highly recommended!"
200,2018-01-15,['hiking'],I just moved to the area. I borrowed my friends Yaktrax and they were a must have for the trail! Took about 2 hours roundtrip.
201,2018-01-13,['hiking'],"Hiked this on Jan. 13. Started a bit after 11 am at the 29th street trailhead. The trail was pretty clear up until the first bridge, then after that you NEED SPIKES on your shoes to safely go up and come down the trail. 

My 1 1/2 year old lab came with me. I put “musher’s mush” on her paws when it got icy to help with the cold ice. She did great going up, but coming down was a bit harder for her (with no spikes), but as long as she went on the side of the trail she was okay for the most part. Also there is running water in the stream for pups to drink out of. I brought her water and she never drank any of it. 

Pretty moderate hike. Not too easy, but not too difficult. I would definitely recommend SPIKES to do this trail - some folks had just the chains and said it was pretty hard to do with those."
202,2018-01-13,[''],it's a nice hiking trail for the family and friends
203,2018-01-07,['hiking'],"Did this hike today, January 6.  It's not too long, and the view of the frozen waterfall at the end is definitely worth it! 

We were grateful that we brought our snowshoes.... not the ideal gear to have on such a rocky trail, but it was way better than nothing. We couldn't have made it up without them!  

Our dog made it up with us as well. There were a few slippery spots for her but she was a champ!"
204,2018-01-05,[''],Super icy make sure to wear spikes or chains on your shoes!
205,2017-11-19,['hiking'],Very steep and it gets icy at the top. Waterfall is frozen now. Well do it again next summer.
206,2017-11-03,[''],super fun.....it is very steep but absolutely beautiful....and I solo hike a lot and this trail is very comfy to solo hike on....i would suggest a hiking pole though
207,2017-10-30,[''],amazing!!!
208,2017-10-23,['hiking'],Beautiful hike the whole way up to the falls.
209,2017-10-01,[''],It was a beautiful hike! The only thing is that the trail that takes you to the waterfall goes on a private trail that is not dog friendly. The people that own the property have people on 4-wheelers that will threaten you with a ticket if you don't put a leash on your dog and go back.
210,2017-09-28,[''],Quick hike and gorgeous at the top. Easy stunner!
211,2017-09-20,[''],"beautiful views of golf course, the city, and the forests on the trail up. rocky near the top but was fun to scramble up. been to waterfall in spring, summer, and fall. spring is the best for waterfall, fall is great to see the changes in the leaves. great little hike. kinda busy at peak times"
212,2017-09-17,[''],busy but neat
213,2017-09-16,['hiking'],"Lovely.  It could be very peaceful with the water trickling down alongside the trail.  It's pretty busy though, lots of kids/teens hiking so it's a bit noisy."
214,2017-09-12,[''],"This trail should be upgraded to ""heavily trafficked"" as it's brevity and accessibility makes it popular with young families and hardcore hikers alike."
215,2017-09-11,['hiking'],"Perfect trail for families. May be difficult for very young children, but if you help them you'll be fine."
216,2017-09-04,['hiking'],
217,2017-08-30,[''],Great hike. Not as spectacular a waterfall as Adams Canyon one but great nonetheless.
218,2017-08-29,['hiking'],The hike is definitely strenuous!  The waterfall was nice and a great view of the valley
219,2017-08-27,['hiking'],"The views are fantastic and the trail is well maintained with lots of hikers, dogs, and some cyclists. I would actually rate this hike as an advanced hike due to the steep incline and rocky terrain. Well worth the extra effort. Unfortunately there was a lot of feces along the trail, so it would be nice to see it cleaned up.
Parking is easy and clean, and trail is fairly marked but I would recommend taking a map for first time hikers."
220,2017-08-26,['hiking'],"really good hike, I would go in the morning so it's not as hot. It's pretty steep and can be slick. It took my husband and I about 2 hours from start to finish."
221,2017-08-24,[''],good quick hike
222,2017-08-24,['hiking'],So glad to finally do it.  Good workout
223,2017-08-21,[''],Loved it! The rocks make it a little harder then moderate in places but me and the love of my life enjoyed every minute of it and we'll go back often.
224,2017-08-14,[''],"Beautiful, fun, and easy"
225,2017-08-11,[''],Very easy but graded well and easy to follow path. Some parts with uneven rocks up toward the creek falls but an easy up and down
226,2017-08-10,['hiking'],"The start is a bit boring until you turn onto the actual canyon trail. Before you get to it you will be on a road, with lots of dog mess unfortunately. Once you are headed up into the canyon the scenery is spectacular, and it changes between hiking and a little bit of climbing, but all easy , safe, and well-maintained. The falls are gorgeous, but try to get there early before folks start showing up and climbing the cliffs and acting stupid. (clearly marked, do not climb)"
227,2017-08-09,['hiking'],Excellent hike.  Did it one morning before a conference.
228,2017-08-07,['hiking'],4-ish ⭐️s Not to bad a hike
229,2017-08-06,[''],"Of Wasatch waterfalls, this one is spectacular. We caught it mid day as the canyon shadows disected the misty sunlight above. Amazing hike that is good for families and kids."
230,2017-08-02,['hiking'],Very pretty. If you go earlier in the year (may-June) the waterfall has much more water coming down whereas it's mostly just a trickle towards the end of the summer
231,2017-07-28,[''],"one of my favorite fast, yet effective trails."
232,2017-07-28,['hiking'],"Such a great hike! However, I started from 36th street trailhead as opposed to the 29th street one. Standing real close to the waterfall is a nice way to cool off, feels amazing if you do the hike in the afternoon! Overall, a fantastic view and great scenery on the way."
233,2017-07-24,[''],Great time hiking this one yesterday! Beautiful!
234,2017-07-22,['hiking'],"It was hard for me because of an ankle injury that is still recovering. But, it was enjoyable."
235,2017-07-22,['hiking'],"The first part of the trail (to the Bonneville Shoreline junction) ascends pretty quickly and is fairly exposed, but after that point it's an easy hike to the waterfall.
Speaking of which--fantastic! The waterfall spreads across a large stone wall; quite striking! 

Overall, a nice view for a relatively short hike (~2.5 miles total) If you go before noon, the cove that encloses the waterfall is pretty shaded."
236,2017-07-20,[''],excellent evening hike. went with 5 year old and little man pulled it off no problem!
237,2017-07-16,[''],Great little hike!
238,2017-07-13,['hiking'],good workout...including Bonneville trail was awesome.
239,2017-07-12,[''],"Great hike! Better if you can go earlier in the am but once you get into the canyon the trees shaded you great. I was nervous to do it with my kids but my 3,5,7 year old did great! Went in the middle of the week so it wasn't very crowded. The falls were beautiful!! Loved it!!"
240,2017-07-11,['hiking'],My 12 and 6 year old did it with a mild amount of resistance they needed a few breaks and when they got to the end... They loved it. I recommend going later  around 6 it was excruciatingly hot we started at 430 and ran out of our 2 liter hydration pack halfway in :(. The waterfall is breathtaking and so many beautiful puppies to pet along the way.
241,2017-07-06,['hiking'],a moderately difficult hike but nice scenery biggest complaint was it was packed with people even mid day during the work week.
242,2017-07-06,[''],"I have done this trail several times over the years.  We decided to go with my 5 year old (never been on this trail) and found it was more difficult for him.  The rocky step parts of the trail were the hardest parts and we really had to help him since he was scared of slipping.  With that being said the waterfall and views at the top kept him going to reach the end.  It really is a beautiful, short hike."
243,2017-07-04,[''],What a beautiful hike. Your in full sun for a while and then you get some much deserved shade. We took our six year old and she did great on this hike. The falls is absolutely amazing. Bring some snacks and sit down and enjoy the view once you get up to the falls.
244,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful!  Hot at first, but the waterfall provides an excellent place to cool off."
245,2017-07-01,['hiking'],"The waterfall is beautiful! It's a little steep on the incline towards the top of the waterfall, but nothing too bad. Anyone in reasonably good health could do this hike. 
I recommend contacting the Ogden waterfall zipline company so that you can ride the ziplines once you get to the top. It's a guided tour up to the waterfall, and you have to have a minimum of three people to be able to sign up for it. Once you get to the top, you get to put on your gear, climb up the rock ledges, and do 4 zips across the front of the waterfall. If you have the opportunity to schedule this, I'd definitely do it!"
246,2017-06-25,[''],"Great hike! Very rocky so be prepared to climb and on the way down it can get slippery on the rocks so wear shoes with a good grip. This hike was perfect, not too long or short and the waterfall was breathtaking!"
247,2017-06-24,[''],I love this trail! Beautiful! Well worth the hike to get to the amazing waterfall!
248,2017-06-23,['hiking'],"Really beautiful views but really steep hike. Once you get around the rock bend, boom the waterfall is right there and amazing. Got a little shower from the fall at top too which is a nice cool off. View definitely is worth it."
249,2017-06-23,['hiking'],"Perfect trail to hike if you are from out of town and limited on time. You get in a decent workout and it has a lot to offer visually if you like seeing flowing water, mountain, foliage and such. I took my 15 year old daughter (she is autistic) and this hike was a challenge for her because you are climbing up the whole way to the waterfall and there are a few areas with lose rock. However she is fascinated by water so the reward of the gorgeous waterfall at the end was amazingly worth it!  We did get a bit lost and after meeting a very nice gentleman that pointed us in the right direction we had to back track, so be sure to use your AllTrails app because there are few signs in the beginning of the trail and that's basically it. We were just visiting Utah briefly and I am very happy this is the trail we picked. It gave just enough, and the water was crystal clear and the waterfall was mesmerizingly magnificent!"
250,2017-06-22,[''],"Great hike for kids, especially thanks to the ""grand finale"" at the end.  Well defined trail, a little rock-scrambling involved, very fun."
251,2017-06-20,['hiking'],Great little hike if you are looking to get a small hike in during a visit to the SLC area.
252,2017-06-17,['hiking'],Nice trail; runnable for quite a ways. Ties into the Bonneville Shoreline trail for longer trail run.  Great waterfall at the top and creek for most of hike.
253,2017-06-14,['hiking'],Fun trail ok for kids.
254,2017-06-08,['hiking'],It gets bit hard past 50% but it's so worth it the final waterfall perspective at the end.
255,2017-06-08,['hiking'],"This hike is a great workout. It's pretty steep the whole way up, but seeing as it is a shorter hike it's good! There is more water now then I've ever seen it! It was beautiful and the view is worth the hike up."
256,2017-06-07,['hiking'],Pretty mellow the first 2/3 of the way up. Last section gets pretty steep and rocky. Beautiful Hike.
257,2017-06-07,[''],A fun hike with a very scenic endpoint! I love all the fun rocks to climb around and over!
258,2017-06-05,[''],Absolutely gorgeous waterfall!
259,2017-06-05,[''],"This is a great hike for the entire family. It starts out easy with a groomed trail/dirt road. Then turns slightly more difficult in the trees with some rocky terrain cross-crossing the stream. I had my wife and two daughters (7&10). There were a lot of people but there is plenty of room and the view at the top is great! It took us around 2 hours including sitting down to eat a packed lunch. 
We will do this one again."
260,2017-06-04,['hiking'],"Signature hike of Ogden. So obviously it's a great hike. It's mostly shaded and the views are amazing. But it's also a little busy at times. A bit strenuous toward the end compared other ""moderate"" trails I've hiked."
261,2017-06-03,['hiking'],Really crowded all along the trail and at the waterfall. Kinda made it a little less enjoyable but still a pretty good hike!
262,2017-06-01,[''],Waterfall is always a good hike! Beautiful views and a good workout.
263,2017-06-01,[''],"This would be a cool hike if it weren't so close to town and so popular. Everybody and their brother hikes to Waterfall and on the weekends you'll wish you had chosen a different hike for this very reason. I like to hike to get out in nature and have some peace, on this hike you'll probably run into your neighbor, your co-worker, and your ex-boyfriend all in the same day. If you can go on a Sunday early in the morning or late in the evening, or better yet a weekday when all of those people are at work you might actually get to enjoy this hike. Once you make it to the waterfall you want to enjoy the view and the water so it's nice when there aren't 20 other people sitting at the top. Also don't try to be cool and climb the waterfall, so so so many people have fallen off and died. And you really don't want to have a nice little hike end in a helicopter flight down to the ER."
264,2017-06-01,[''],I am always looking forward to a good view after a hike. This one didn't disappoint.
265,2017-05-30,['hiking'],Was a very nice hike. The falls are amazing!
266,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"We loved this hike! First time going there and it was beautiful. We had our two kids 4 and 7, and our neighbors grandson who is also 4 and they did awesome! We brought our 6 month old puppy with as well. Overall a great short hike for all. A little hot at the time of day when we went but so worth it."
267,2017-05-29,['hiking'],Waterfall canyon is a great hike for people of all ages. Today we went up with our family and dog. The trail was a bit crowded with many other outdoor enthusiast seeking the peace of the great outdoors. The hike has a steady elevation gain which is a bit strenuous at times. Don't worry though it's not a long hike. The destination is worth it!
268,2017-05-29,[''],"Great hike! As a first time hiker I wasn't really prepared, but the moderate effort was well worth the views and of course the waterfall at the end. It had a decent amount of traffic, but the trail was wide enough to not make it difficult to pass. The grade is a little steep and rocky at times, but nothing the average person can't handle. I recommend this hike to anyone visiting the Ogden area."
269,2017-05-26,['hiking'],"Pretty easy hike, trail is quite rocky, but isn't too long. And the waterfall at the end is worth the hike."
270,2017-05-25,[''],We love this trail. I took my 3year old on it and he hiked it himself. He didn't need to be carried until we were almost to the fence on our way back to our car.
271,2017-05-25,[''],This spring the waterfall is massive. It's very worth the hike now
272,2017-05-23,['hiking'],"This was a great hike! We went with a large family (1 pregnant)  and two dogs (1 small 1 large). The kids did the hike up in about 45 minutes. It took most of the adults almost exactly an hour. You gain quite a bit of elocation on this hike especially towards the end. It is also very rocky, with very large and loose boulders that you are climbing over towards the top. This also makes the hike down a little more difficult. For the adults it took almost exactly two hours round trip. The waterfall was awesome this time of year with all the water, and the stream was way fun for all the kids and the dogs. You hit water and the tree canopy about 1/3 of the way in so as long as it isn't too hot you shouldn't need water for your dog. With most of the trail in the shade tons of water, sun screen, and  bug spray are really not necessary. You won't regret going on this hike. One other note, there are restrooms at the trail head."
273,2017-05-22,['hiking'],"Worth the hike to see waterfall. Path takes you onto Private Lands (allowable) Parking lot at the end of 29th St. From parking lot, go uphill, keep going right until the gates to the TR Guest Ranch, Public Welcome sign/gate. At fork above water tanks in drainage, go left. Be careful of loose rock when returning from falls."
274,2017-05-20,[''],"Crowded trail, people with 4 year olds with sandals on a trail that's very rocky and slippery. Good to do once, but won't be back."
275,2017-05-11,[''],"This was a good hike and the waterfall at the end is beautiful! It does get really rocky and slippery the farther up you go, and it's steep.

Warning to those who want to take your dogs: I took my two pups and some parts get really narrow, and it can be really difficult to manage them if you have to have them on leashes (like I do)."
276,2017-05-08,['hiking'],"My wife, 2 dogs and I completed this hike today (5-07-2017). It was pure beauty throughout, especially once we entered the canyon area. It was trying, though rewarding for us. Will definately be hitting this one up in the future (Minus the dogs)"
277,2017-05-07,[''],
278,2017-05-07,[''],fun hike...awesome waterfall
279,2017-05-07,[''],"This was a beautiful hike- I did it with small children and dogs---I would say that this hike would be best for children over the age of 5 or 6.......I ended up carrying my youngest the majority of the way which took its toll on me since this is a very steep and rocky climb to get to the waterfall and spring time is very wet which results in wet, slippery shoes. it was a little harder than I would regularly take my kids on. Just be prepared to get your workout in and be prepared with little ones for slips, especially with the descent---- but a gorgeous view and lots of shade on the way up!!!"
280,2017-05-05,[''],hard not moderate.
281,2017-04-30,['hiking'],"Great hike. First half a good gradual incline, second half pretty steep. Clear trail, no snow. One of my new favorite hikes, and I hike pretty frequently."
282,2017-04-25,['hiking'],Steeeeeep but worth the effort.
283,2017-04-25,['hiking'],We are regular walkers on level ground and picked this as our first moderate hike and we found the constant uphill pretty tough. It took us 2 hrs to reach the falls. We went Saturday mid afternoon and the car park was full and the walk was very busy. The first part of the track is easy ground but when you reach the rocky section you have to pick your steps carefully. It is very scenic with great views and seeing the waterfall made it worthwhile.
284,2017-04-24,['hiking'],As a beginner in hiking this trail was slightly difficult but definitely worth it! It is absolutely beautiful and family friendly. There are always people going up and down but I still found it very enjoyable.
285,2017-04-23,[''],Great trail! Beautiful Waterfall! Was a little disappointed to find trash from other hikers. All in all though great hike!
286,2017-04-18,['hiking'],Beautiful...even better in the snow!!!
287,2017-04-17,['hiking'],This was a great hike. The last bit was difficult.
288,2017-04-15,['hiking'],Fun and short trail that leads to an excellent reward. This trail is easy with a moderate ascent in which two 5 year olds climbed the whole way without complaining. If you have 2 hours to kill then this is a great option.
289,2017-04-05,['hiking'],"This was one of the closest hikes to our hotel, and what a score. 
There march 31- it was still definitely cool out, however there was plenty of snowmelt from higher up (plenty of snow still up on the mountains for that matter- still snowing when we left). 
Very peaceful following the creek up to the falls. 
And the falls themselves: very impressive. We played around in the pool underneath for well over an hour. 
There are multiple trails off, some of which are not on the map but clearly of regular and approved use. We linked up multiple different on way back to car and only added to a great day as the sun set over great salt lake. 
Highly recommend."
290,2017-04-01,['hiking'],"Fantastic hike! It took us right at 2 hours and 15 minutes.  It's almost two entirely different hikes with a sandy open slow incline for the first half and a steep rocky steeper incline the second half.  Bring food! It's a decent challenge, at least for us inexperienced Kansans."
291,2017-03-30,['hiking'],I loved it! The waterfall was gorgeous and a nice way to cool down after hike. The hike is pretty steep and if you're not an avid hiker or somewhat out of shape it could be a bit difficult. But well worth the effort!
292,2017-03-26,[''],Good hike with some challenging little climbs
293,2017-03-21,[''],this trail is a summer go to. it can get steep at times but my kids and I love it!
294,2017-03-17,['hiking'],"This was my first time doing this hike. The first part was very hot, no shade at all. Once you get into the canyon it's very beautiful and you hike up along the trail. My dogs loved playing in the water.   The waterfall is far more beautiful then I expected. There was still some snow at the base of the waterfall and I had a light long sleeve shirt that was nice since it was a but chilly at the top. I headed up around noon and was back to my car at 1:30. Fairly moderate hike and one I definitely recommend!"
295,2017-03-17,[''],Absolutely beautiful
296,2017-03-15,[''],A bit too steep for my 4 year old. It was pretty crowded since the weather was really warm. I'd definitely do it again sans my 4 year old.
297,2017-03-14,['hiking'],Nice and clear all the way to the waterfall. Awesome hike
298,2017-03-05,['hiking'],"A beautiful morning hike to a frozen waterfall never disappoints!! Bring your micospikes, it's icy for a good part of the hike."
299,2017-02-21,['hiking'],Took my family on our first hike of the year. There is still some snow on the trail past the bridge but we had a great time.
300,2017-02-06,[''],"it was a fun hike! We went when it was about 45° and it was a little icy at times. But nothing too bad! It is Letty hard in the snow without snowshoes, but manageable. The frozen waterfall is worth it 100%!!!!
One thing I will warn about is, please don't go too close to the waterfall, or let your pups too close. We saw some pretty large pieces fall off on 2/4/17. So just be safe, and enjoy the sight! :)"
301,2017-02-05,['hiking'],"This short popular hike in Weber County is a great one to do in the winter and summer, it's like two completely different hikes. I had the hike pegged at about 3.2 miles round trip and 950 ft elevation gain. It took us about 2 hrs 20 minutes with the descent taking about half as long as the ascent. The trail is extremely busy in the summer and is still fairly busy for a winter hike but manageable. We went on a warm day and the snow was very slushy and as a result I would say that wet feet are better than heavy boots for this hike. The waterfall is incredible and towers high overhead and at the time we were there was dropping chunks of ice as it was overly warm for the season. All in all great hike for the family and be extra nice to this trail as it is on private land. Don't want to lose access."
302,2017-01-14,[''],Really well marked. Started from the park entrance. Didn't need to use our snowshoes but it was a little icy. Gradual elevation gain. The frozen waterfall is well worth the hike!
303,2016-12-11,['hiking'],Waterfall frozen over on Dec 11. Spectacular.
304,2016-11-27,[''],really well marked out and it's fairly easy and short except for the steepness. also it was slippery with ice on it but easy to drive up to and it had a great ending!
305,2016-11-21,['hiking'],It was awesome!!!!!!
306,2016-11-14,[''],This is a great moderate hike with a little bit of everything. Plenty of rest along the hike with a couple steeper areas.
307,2016-10-19,[''],"We did a long version of this hike, heading down Gibbs loop and up and then up the waterfall trail and back down the shorter way. It was a fun day, challenging while carrying our kids on our backs! The waterfall was mostly dried up but still pretty and the views were great, especially with the fall colors!"
308,2016-10-10,['hiking'],"This was my first hike since roaming the woods as a child in Mississippi. Waterfall was a great hike and good workout. Great scenery and relaxing sounds of water running down a stream near the trail and then the waterfall as you get closer. Great views of Ogden, Utah below as well."
309,2016-10-10,['hiking'],"Tried to hike it just to be turned away at a fence. 
I used to love this hike. Sad it is now private property and if you don't have ID on you, you get turned away."
310,2016-09-29,['hiking'],Haven't hiked it in about 7 years after hiking it all the time back then. Such a fun hike and amazing view.  Moderate hike and steep at top to see the amazing view of Ogden.
311,2016-09-20,[''],"Great views, some elevation climbs and loose rocks but worth the effort.  Weather  was great in sept and a good cool breeze while hiking made for refreshing breaks."
312,2016-09-06,[''],"Great little hike , pretty easy some scrambling , up and back 1 hour 20 minutes"
313,2016-09-06,['hiking'],Definitely worth the climb and great for families. You will have to take some breaks because it has some steep parts. But it's not too long. My favorite time to take this hike is in the spring when the runoff is occurring because the waterfalls are so gorgeous. I've done this one many times and will do it again. It's fun to take your shoes off at the top and play in the water.
314,2016-09-06,[''],Beautiful hike and a great workout.
315,2016-09-06,[''],This trail is well maintained but fairly crowded. It's a short and fun hike that all ages can do if willing to take breaks.
316,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"This is a pretty fast hike, not too difficult. Very popular, usually a lot of people on the trail, views at the waterfall are gorgeous."
317,2016-09-05,[''],Fun hike! Kid friendly!
318,2016-09-04,[''],"my first waterfall hike, challenging coming from flat land but do able and worth it"
319,2016-09-02,['hiking'],"This was our first hike upon moving to Utah as transplants from the relatively flat southeast. There are facilities at the trail head, and dog waste bags are also provided (we brought our own, but it's nice to have backup). The hike is a really good leg workout, as the first half up to the waterfall is at a constant incline. It is open at first, but the trail becomes more narrow and difficult to navigate as you head into the woods and up to the waterfall. There are lots of loose rocks and trip hazards along the way, so watch your footing (our 8 yr old dog did really well the whole way up, but older or arthritic dogs/younger children/inexperienced hikers may find it a bit challenging). The clearing at the waterfall is spacious, so it wasn't particularly crowded even though there were about 20 people + dogs there. The way down can be a little steep in places, so keep an eye on little ones and anyone else that may need assistance. 

There are a lot of great vantage points along the hike, and although I've read that there are a lot of rattlesnakes along the trail, we didn't encounter any (there were plenty of places amongst the rocks for them to be hiding, so just be cautious). A lot of people don't clean up after their dogs, so be wary of landmines. We didn't see very much litter either, but several places along the hike have been vandalized. Overall, a good and relatively quick workout with gorgeous views!"
320,2016-09-01,['hiking'],"very easy trail.  perfect for whole family, kids and dogs. usually a lot of people on this trail. 1st little part is hot and in the sun, the rest is pretty shaded and follows a stream.  nice lunch spot by waterfall at the top. zip line doesnt look worth it but i havent tried it."
321,2016-09-01,['hiking'],easy hiking for the family
322,2016-08-30,['hiking'],Quick and easy trail. Usually alot of people as well as dogs.
323,2016-08-27,['hiking'],"I thought it was a nice hike. The waterfall was more of a high up water trickle, but it was still nice, The last part is wooded and nice. The first part is kind of exposed, but for a short hike it's not too big of a deal. It was a little rocky. I don't know that I would drive from West Valley to do it again but I did not feel like it was a waste of time, just not a favorite."
324,2016-08-20,[''],Great hike!  A bit challenging in places navigating a series of rocks - but also made it interesting.
325,2016-08-19,['hiking'],"this is a good, quick hike. worth doing!"
326,2016-08-16,[''],"Great hike, hard with little kids though. There's a lot of people and a lot of rattlesnakes. Beautiful views though and a lovely river to walk along!"
327,2016-08-15,['hiking'],One of my family and I favorite hikes. Short and sweet with a beautiful fall at the end. Only drawback is that it always busy.
328,2016-08-13,['hiking'],"The hike was very difficult. If you have never hike, don't hike this trail.  There is barely water coming down on the waterfall.  It was very disappointing."
329,2016-08-12,['hiking'],"View at the end was totally worth the somewhat challenging hike — at least, with kids it was ;-)"
330,2016-08-10,['hiking'],"Always fun, but always crowded. Pretty steep hike, but short enough that you can complete it quickly."
331,2016-08-04,[''],Fun climb with friends
332,2016-08-01,[''],Totally worth it!!
333,2016-07-31,[''],Great!!!
334,2016-07-30,[''],"Hiked this once in April when there was still snow, and then again in July. Not sure which one I liked more.  The snow made it slick, but it wasn't as hot."
335,2016-07-25,[''],Awesome!  5 year old girl struggled a little bit but did well. 8 and 11 year old did great!
336,2016-07-23,['hiking'],"Throughly enjoyed this one. Waterfall was okay, but it was the view that made it worth it. Clear cut path makes it easy to follow. Shady areas at the top make it a great rest spot too!"
337,2016-07-20,['hiking'],Fun hike.  Rocky towards the top for children.  Would do it again.
338,2016-07-17,['hiking'],Absolutely loved this hike! It was a little slippery in a few places with rocks but other than that it was great! My 6 and 7 y/o boys loves it to!
339,2016-07-15,[''],"I loved this hike! It is mainly uphill so it provides a nice leg workout. The path provides plenty of shade. The weather even drops a few degrees as you get into the shaded area. The view of the waterfall is breath taking! They now do zip lining, next time I go I'm trying it!"
340,2016-07-10,['hiking'],my first hike and it nearly killed me. I'm not used to the elevation or dryness. I should come back in late spring when the water flow is better.
341,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"It's a challenging trail/hike if you are carrying a child on your back, but the pay off of the waterfall is worth it!! It's uphill with lots of rocky areas, great for dogs except the beginning might be too hot depending on the time of year. We love this trail!!"
342,2016-07-04,['hiking'],had a blast! the waterfall was definitely worth the hike in!
343,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Great trail! There is not a level spot the entire way up. All up hill. However, the waterfall is tall and beautiful. Well worth the climbing. There are zip lines at the waterfall. My wife and I went and it was soo beautiful. Ian and Chris (the zip line operators) Were top notch and we felt safe the entire time. Not a bad deal for 30.00 per person. I highly recommend it. Stunning views as you zip past the waterfall."
344,2016-07-02,['hiking'],Awesome trip up to a spectacular 200' waterfall! I did it twice in the week I spent in Ogden!
345,2016-07-01,['hiking'],I loved waterfall canyon trail!  It was very pretty and a good challenge. The waterfall at the end was beautiful and very refreshing. I'd say it's good for kids 6 years and older. It's very safe and the trail us well marked so there's no chance of getting lost. Can't wait to do it again 
346,2016-06-28,['hiking'],Awesome trail. The top was so beautiful!
347,2016-06-22,[''],moderate trail
348,2016-06-21,['hiking'],"Great dog friendly trail, if you do this in the summer time the waterfall at the end can be a great payoff to cool down. It can get a bit steep but still easy to manage."
349,2016-06-20,['hiking'],Fabulous hike!  Strenuous but well worth it.  Gorgeous views.
350,2016-06-20,[''],Fun hike my family looks forward to every year. Watch out for rattle snakes.
351,2016-06-16,['hiking'],"Easy hike, bit steep but bearable, very beautiful waterfalls, kids can do it, there are people who offer zip lining f0r $20-30 on top. Dog friendly, but owners should be responsible on getting their dogs shit, and people should stop complaining about being crowded, this is open for public so what do you expect?"
352,2016-06-14,[''],Beautiful hike went on a Friday evening so no crowd really. Shaded most of the way up and runs right next to the water. Really awesome easy trail.
353,2016-06-01,[''],Awesome waterfall!! Loved that it was dog friendly but it was super crowded with people. Could have gotten 5 stars if it wasnt so crowded. Strenuous trail due to the elevation gain but well worth it.
354,2016-05-31,[''],"took the longer scenic route and it was amazing took 5 kids (ages 5,13,14,14,17) and they all did great and really enjoyed it"
355,2016-05-29,['hiking'],Great moderately difficult hike.
356,2016-05-27,[''],"Great hike, beautiful waterfall:)"
357,2016-05-22,[''],Quite a rocky climb in a short distance. especially the last half. Worth the view at the top though.
358,2016-05-19,['hiking'],"This trail is great for a quick afternoon walk or picnic. There are a couple of places where my kids (7,9) had some trouble and by the time we were leaving it was getting really busy but I thought it was a nice quick trail."
359,2016-05-15,[''],"My pups love this place. Very friendly hikers. (BEWARE! Of other dog owners someone hit my dog with a hiking stick because they didn't like dogs) and it got pretty nasty. 



IF YOU DO NOT LIKE DOGS GO TO ANOTHER CANYON."
360,2016-05-15,['hiking'],this was a great hike to even do my youself. It was wet and slick on the rocks so wear good shoes. The scenery is amazing!
361,2016-05-14,['hiking'],"Great hike, insanely busy on a nice warm day which is why I took of a star but the waterfall is incredible, one of the tallest I've been to. The trial is well maintained but still quite steep and very rocky towards the end. All in all a great hike though."
362,2016-05-12,[''],Incredible waterfall! Especially early in the season. First week of May is an excellent time to see it full with the new snowmelt.
363,2016-05-05,[''],I loved it as well as my dog! The waterfall is rewarding!
364,2016-05-03,[''],Love this trail. The waterfall is so gorgeous. It's for sure moderate. Little kids can do this we saw a 2 year old on the trail with his dad and many families. Few tough spots but soooooo worth it in the end. One of my favorites! I will do this over and over and over again!
365,2016-04-30,[''],Beautiful
366,2016-04-27,[''],Fun and easy even with all the rocks it was sill obvious where the trail is. The end result when you reach the waterfall is perfect.
367,2016-04-26,['hiking'],This is a great hike with a waterfall reward.
368,2016-04-22,[''],Fun
369,2016-04-18,[''],Lots of climbing rocks but a fun hike
370,2016-04-18,['hiking'],"The waterfall is a must-see. The trail is rocky and reasonably steep but not very difficult for someone used to hiking. It is a great weekend activity for families, and is really popular on weekends."
371,2016-04-10,[''],harder than i thought it would be but the rocks are fun to climb at the top. and the river is really nice. someone got hurt at the top and  we passed several search and rescue guys on their way up to get them.  i wouldnt do this with really little kids.
372,2016-04-10,['hiking'],Fun hike all around.  Many trails to explore the mountain side and spend a great day outside on.
373,2016-04-07,['hiking'],Love this hike ❤️
374,2016-04-04,[''],"nice hike, didn't quite make it to the top. got a bit too rocky for our 18 month old who refuses to be carried. will be doing it again when we have a babysitter;)"
375,2016-04-03,[''],One of the best trails in Utah!
376,2016-03-28,['hiking'],"It was fun! Short but mostly uphil, it's doable anytime of the years"
377,2015-10-17,[''],Long time favorite. Quick trail run that connects to many other trails. Water flow is best in the spring.
378,2015-10-16,['hiking'],"Trail was a moderate climb.  First mile up the canyon the trail was crushed gravels and wide!  The remaining .5 mile the trail became more narrow and more hazardous!  Overall the hike was easy and enjoyable!  I beat the crowds and heat by leaving early in the morning!  Encountered many nice people on the way down!  The fall is on private property and there were many signs asking people to not contribute to erosion!  Not much water over the falls but still enjoyable view of the valley below! Clean trail with not much trash! Did encounter some dogs without a leash that tried to bite me and dog feces!  Please keep your dogs on a leash please!  Great trail, great hike and I look forward to doing it again!"
379,2015-09-28,[''],It was beautiful
380,2015-09-11,[''],It's a super fun hike with lots of variations in difficulty level and views
381,2015-09-10,[''],The view at the top is framed by the mountains and it is gorgeous... Especially at sunset.
382,2015-09-03,[''],"Went on this hike yesterday after work with 2 coworkers and it was a really nice hike. Not to hot or crowded. Starts off level, but get ready it was a great workout for a beginner hiker. I took mini breaks to enjoy the view and catch my breath. It was worth the 3.2 miles with the majority of the hike being an incline. Once you reach the top the view was amazing and the waterfall was not forceful but enjoyable. On the way down the sunset was breath taking, but be careful the rocks can be slippery."
383,2015-08-23,['rock climbing'],"Great time, first time in Utah. Definitely made my work trip an unforgettable experience :-)"
384,2015-07-28,['hiking'],Recently went hiking on this trail at night. Definitely not the safest idea due to location and the rocky trail but the view at night is quite beautiful!
385,2015-07-25,[''],Great hike. The cool mist blowing off the falls felt great on a hot day.
386,2015-07-04,['hiking'],"This used to be a really great hike to a beautiful waterfall. The last time we went, we ended up turning around and going home. There was way to many people trying to hike, bike and run up the trail not to mention the horrid amount of dog poop along the trail. We had our dog with us ( which we always clean up after) so we understand that dogs poop, but clean it up! I've never seen that much poop left on the trail. There were hundreds of piles. Really sad."
387,2015-06-25,[''],It was great. It did have a lot of rock hopping though which was hard
388,2015-06-16,['hiking'],Waterfall is perfect.
389,2015-06-15,['hiking'],Easy and fun hiking trail to take the kids on (7 and 9 year old). Waterfall is pretty cool and worth the small hike and busy trail.
390,2015-06-09,['cross country skiing'],Rocky but fun
391,2015-06-08,['hiking'],"Very high traffic trail, pretty steep hike up, it felt longer than 2.6 miles in total, must start tracking my hikes! Cool waterfall, although at the time it was more like lots of snow and water dripping down the side of the mountain... Definitely worth the hike, good for all ages!"
392,2015-05-29,[''],"The water is roaring right now, get up there!"
393,2015-05-27,['bird watching'],This trail was awesome! My legs will be jello tomorrow but it was worth it! It was a little challenging at points for my 6 year old but she managed to rock it out! The waterfall was stunning! I didn't realize how big it was!
394,2015-05-18,[''],"My first experience with this trail was in June around 7pm it was a fairly easy hike until the end where there were more rocky areas that took a little more time and effort to get around. The view was beautiful and next time I think I'll start hiking back down defore sundown so I can see the sunset
 Overall I felt like the trail was well maintained but also crowded."
395,2015-04-18,[''],"I've hiked all around this area and took the trail out to the dike before, but primary reason for being here was for Geocaching."
396,2015-03-31,['hiking'],"Did this hike on 3/28. Was really fun. There were a lot of people and dogs on the trail but overall not too bad. Started off way easy and picked up towards the end. Lots of steep areas and loose rocks, but was well worth the effort."
397,2015-03-22,['hiking'],Too crowded for my taste.  Unfortunately with the up rise in people using this trail it has become over run with poop and cigarette butts.
398,2015-03-01,['hiking'],This was a beautiful well manicured safe hike.
399,2015-02-17,['hiking'],"Waterfall Canyon is one of my favorite local hikes when I need to get out and enjoy the outdoors.  Park at the end of 29th street.  This hike can get really crowded, but if you can hit it on a weekday you may find the waterfall all to yourself.  This hike is steep and the last half is pretty rocky.  The waterfall is best viewed in the spring after a good snowmelt, however, the cold winter temps can cause the falls to freeze into beautiful blue ice (perhaps mid February).  Winter hiking will require spikes as the trail can get icy."
400,2015-01-05,['hiking'],Not a bad hike up. A little steep and some loose rock.  The waterfall and surrounding rock face is great. Nice view of the city and plenty of places to stop for lunch at the top. A lot of people though.
401,2014-09-02,['hiking'],Thank you so much for including the pictures of the puple rocks.  I decided to search waterfall canyon and it just made my day seeing  the pictures of my son's rocks  on this page.  I can not hike up the trail anymore it has gotten very rocky and hard on my knees so it was nice to see his rocks are still there and still purple (Christopher's favorite color).  Enjoy the hike and the beauty of this amazing canyon.  Just alway becareful when climbing on the Rocks.  Christopher's Rock just broke off the side of mountin and they both fell.  So please please be very very careful.  Water Fall Canyon is a very beautiful place to enjoy.
402,2014-07-29,['hiking'],"One of my favorite ""quickie"" hikes for when I need to get out or to trail run. It's not a long hike but the elevation change is marvelous. The waterfall is best in winter or spring. You can boulder up and around it to get to a reservoir."
403,2014-06-23,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery but the hike to get to the falls will take a toll on your body.  All of the hikers we passed were very nice and considerate. Bring plenty of water to drink and take your time to get to the top. The return trip to the parking lot was a blessing as gravity helped get this 54 year old grandpa and his family home to their auto.  Overall a moderate to strenuous hike so take it easy as the weather gets hotter. Today it was almost 90 with full sun.  Andy from West Bountiful
404,2014-06-15,['hiking'],"This was a lovely trail. I took my dog late on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded. I was going at a pretty fast pace and if I hadn't stopped at the top to lounge in the sun for a bit, it would only have taken me an hour round trip. If you're putting the trail head into Google Maps, use ""29th St Trailhead"" not ""Waterfall Canyon Trailhead."" The latter took me to a gated community in Ogden with no trail in sight! There were a few parts where the trail was very narrow and strewn with large rocks, so I could see how it would not be a fun hike on a crowded day."
405,2014-05-22,['hiking'],"First tried this hike when it was still cold out, and that was a mistake. It was wet, muddy, and slippery. I completed the hike on the second try. I'm fit, but this was a challenge. Most of the hike is spent climbing rocks at a steep incline. It's a very popular route, and was crowded with people and dogs. I didn't enjoy how it was so close to Ogden that you saw the city anywhere you went. Didn't really provide that 'lost in nature' feeling. I also hated the rock climbing as it was very dangerous. As previous commenters stated, the rocks are loose, and humans are stupid. Some will try to rush up the rocks to get to the waterfall and damn near fall in the process."
406,2013-07-04,['hiking'],"the trail had beautiful scenery. For the most part it was an easy hike, many families had kids and dogs with them. there were a few spots that were difficult to hike and would be considered rock climbing."
407,2013-06-27,['hiking'],"Took my wife and son up a few weeks ago. It was a fun little hike and the waterfall at the end is pretty cool. The only downside is that it's a very popular trail with quite a few people on it, but what do you expect on a trail right next to a university and with a big waterfall at the end? Also, I've been told there are a lot of rattlesnakes along with trail but we didn't see any; still, it's always good to keep an eye out."
408,2013-06-25,['hiking'],"This hike was a joke. There were about 200 people at the top and at least 150 on the trail. It was hard to enjoy it. The hike itself was very strenuous and dangerous in parts because of all the people. The trail became a single file trail in some parts but that didn't matter to people as they kept pushing their way through. Many times we had to cling to trees to keep from getting pushed off the trail. Once we got to the top it was wall to wall people and no one had any sense in their head to slow down. People were rushing up and down the mountain, causing rocks to fall and even people. Several children fell on the rocky top. A man and his daughter fell down off a rock when it came loose. Thankfully no one was seriously hurt! The waterfall was beautiful though"
409,2013-05-11,['hiking'],Nice waterfall. Way too many people on the trail- dogs and kids everywhere on narrow rocky trails. Probably a better hike if it were a weekday and not a weekend.
410,2013-04-17,['hiking'],"I hate this hike but will do it once a year as long as I am hiking just to get it out of the way (leave no trail unexplored!).  It is a solid incline with a lame waterfall at the end.  I say this because I grew up in the midwest where waterfalls were amazing.  When I moved out here, everyone told me this is the hike to see. They told me how amazing it was.  Naturally, I expected something better.  I gave 2 stars because I did climb beyond the falls to see how high I could get and that was fun... but it is my least favorite hike."
411,2012-12-13,['hiking'],"The waterfall at the top is well worth the 3 mile hike.  It's fairly rocky and dangerous for kids under 8 years in my opinion.  We took our kiddos age 4 and 6 that included myself, husband, and sister. We all took turns hoisting them up at certain times and my kids are fairly agile so just consider the risks of falling if you have little ones. Otherwise, this is definitely a trail that I would hike again with friends and older family members."
412,2012-08-24,['hiking'],Fun little hike close to our home and one we will do over and over again. Met a lot of nice people and crossed a lot of other trails with dogs and bikers. 
413,2012-08-12,['hiking'],"A great strenuous hike! Although only a 3 mile hike round trip, its a good workout. The path is mainly uphill with rocky terrain. There are a few difficult places where you may slide down on the way back. There are lots of paths to take, but of you're looking for the waterfall, follow the stream of water. Because the snow season is over, the waterfall was not very exciting. Others suggest going in May for bigger results. I believe the waterfall is 200 feet high. "
414,2012-08-11,['hiking'],"I did this hike with a good friend and it was awesome. A little tough for our ""first hike"" this summer but it was worth it. Slightly tough on the knees coming down and walking sticks would of helped my friends knees. Although beautiful at the end the trail is heavily used. Start early in the morning. "
415,2012-07-23,['hiking'],Redundant with the Other listing for Waterfall Canyon Trail.
416,2012-07-18,['hiking'],Fun hike.  Easy to find the trail head and stay on course.  It is obviously dry this year and the falls shows it. I will come back earlier next year.  I went with my 4 year old and she did just fine. 
417,2012-07-15,['hiking'],"Great trail!! Not to hard of a hike. I was able to put my son on my back with our Kelty pack and made it to the waterfall. 
The trail along the front of the mountain before you hit the canyon is a great easy walk. Once you hit the canyon there are rocks to negotiate but nothing to out of hand. 
Lots of trails up here so make sure when you hit the canyon you stay by the stream and you'll find your way to the top. "
418,2012-06-12,['hiking'],"Waterfall Canyon is one of my favorite and of course a lot of others as well.  This is a high traffic area and well groomed trail.  This trail is great for families; it is a gradual climb up to the fall.  Once inside the Canyon it provides a lot of shade to keep cool during those hot summer days.  I really prefer to visit it in the winter when it has frozen over.  I also like to view this waterfall from the Ridge to the South of here.  On top of that ridge is a climbing park that overlooks the whole Canyon.  This area is a bit more challenging and not for all ages, but has the best views of the Waterfall top to bottom."
419,2012-06-07,['hiking'],"I hike this every year. It is steep in some parts and gets kind of rocky at the top. Beautiful waterfall, and well worth the hike. It's very kid friendly and can be pretty busy on weekends and holidays."
420,2012-06-07,['hiking'],A beautiful hike - an easier trail but still lots of different terrain and paths to take.  The only down side was that a lot of people seem to neglect picking up after their dogs so the aroma of dog poop basting in the sun got a bit unpleasant sometimes - and some of the larger hiking groups were not very friendly and were not very willing to step to the side when you were trying to pass while they were taking a break. 
421,2012-06-03,['hiking'],Where do you guys park at? The map says 27th street but I'm hearing go up 29th. I hiked this today started behind weber college and it has been one of the best hikes yet. 
422,2012-05-29,['hiking'],"This was a fun hike, but wish I would have brought my boots instead of the keens, for the ankle support in rocks.  Oh well. Very busy due to holiday weekend... and I mean very busy. I did have fun with wife and daughter. And nothing is better than a freezing cold 200 foot high shower.  "
423,2012-05-21,['hiking'],Fun trail I loved it. I got turned around a couple of times but thats pretty usual for me. Awesome waterfall. 
424,2012-05-18,['hiking'],I love this hike. Lots of great views and of course the amazing waterfall at the top.
425,2012-05-14,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes as a local from this area! Great scenery, and half way up you get
To follow the river and be in a shaded area. A couple of great rock climbing places, bouldering and rope climbing for skilled climbers. An Excellent hike almost all year round! "
426,2012-05-05,['hiking'],"Beautiful Waterfall! I hike this several times a year. Round trip in an hour, at most, if your conditioning is good. Steep and rocky towards the top. Well worth the trip."
427,2012-04-19,['hiking'],If you are in decent to good physical condition this trail isn't very demanding.  It is however beautiful scenery and good for the kids.
428,2012-04-09,['hiking'],I am pretty heavy... And decided to try this trail for a source to help me lose weight... It was steep in some spots and took me 2hrs instead of 1.5 but it was a beautiful hike and the waterfall is beautiful too you can get right up to it. We have even taken our kids ages 2 3 and 4
429,2012-03-19,['hiking'],very worth the hike!
430,2011-11-19,['trail running'],"Great trial!  Took my dog for the run of her life and she loved every minute of it.  Some ice in some spots so a bit ""fun"" having a 70 lb pitbull pulling you back down.  Beautiful hike!"
431,2011-09-07,['hiking'],I hike this trail every spring with my best friend. Great scenery of the valley and an amazing waterfall up top. 
432,2011-09-05,['hiking'],Attempted this late one afternoon and decided to turn back because we didn't have any lights. We returned 8-3-11 and completed the trail. It was definitely worth the trip and we will do it again. 
433,2011-08-12,['hiking'],"Good hike, but the falls at the top were really nice.  Great to play in on a hot summer's day."
434,2011-08-05,['hiking'],Liked the hike.  Mostly shaded which is nice on a hot day.  Beautiful views.  It was nice to have a good hike and then be rewarded by a beautiful waterfall.  It also helped that the mist cools you off completely before heading back down.  Don't plan on running on this trail- lots of large boulders.  Could run about half way down- closer to the beginning of the trail.
435,2011-07-30,['hiking'],"Good family hike, enjoy the falls and the water on a very hot day.  "
436,2011-07-19,['hiking'],Wonderful trail. Dogs and kids welcome. The waterfall at the top is breathtaking!
437,2011-06-17,['hiking'],Was a pretty strenous hike for me but was all worth it when we made it to the top.
438,2011-06-17,['hiking'],"good day hike only takes a few hours up and back, take your time and watch for Rocks."
439,2011-04-21,['hiking'],"This is my favorite hike, been up here many times.  This particular time I placed a geocache above the falls.  Don't go after it, unless you know your limits."
440,2010-06-08,['hiking'],Really beautiful trip up to a really spectacular ginormous waterfall. Fairly short hike that wasn't all that hard. If you're adventurous then at the top of the falls there's a spot to start climbing up the rocks and get up on the mountain above the falls.
441,2009-10-15,[''],"Beautiful trail, especially in the fall (The waterfall was still amazing, although I suppose it would be quite a bit bigger in spring.)  Probably one of the busiest trails in Ogden, for good reason.  The trail involves a bit of clambering, which is probably a positive rather than a negative for most people on this site :-)"
