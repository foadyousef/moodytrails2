0,2019-08-24,['hiking'],Great learning and adventure trail for kids
1,2019-07-30,['hiking'],We did this hike in sandals and saw a family pushing a stroller around the loop. Very easy hike. 
2,2019-07-19,['hiking'],This little trail has some of the most beautiful views I’ve seen packed into one little short hike.  I’d call it a MUST DO in the area.
3,2019-07-07,['hiking'],Easy trail. Suitable for all ages. Nice wildflowers in the summer. The trail is all yours in the evening. 
4,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"Easy trail, not much traffic in evening "
5,2019-06-29,['hiking'],Nice little loop. Beautiful wild flowers out right now.
6,2019-06-27,['hiking'],"I almost didn't go because it looked too easy,  but it was a very nice hike. my daughter loved the informational signs.  "
7,2019-06-27,['hiking'],Beautiful wildflowers all over today. It was great for the seven little kids and toddlers with us.

9,2019-06-15,[''],Fun trail and very pretty. My favorite hike with kids. There is still some snow in the side of the trail which the kids loved. Lots of shade and pretty flat and well maintained. 
10,2019-06-13,['hiking'],"This trail is extremely easy. More of a nature walk. That being said, it is fun, quick, there are signs to read and a cool lookout where you can see Bear Lake and sit down for a minute. Driving from logan it did take a while and the hike is pretty short so I would recommend finding a couple of hikes to do in the area instead of making the drive for just the one. Or hitting this hike on the way to Bear Lake or something."
11,2019-06-11,['hiking'],My most used trail!

13,2019-03-03,"['snowshoeing', 'snow']","I went with a group of 18. 16 on snowshoes, 2 on cross country skis. Great easy trail! Beautiful views! I will definitely be doing this one again!"
14,2018-09-17,['hiking'],"We came here to get away from the weekend crowds at other trails. Saw only one other person on this trail. The portion above tree line was stunning, dotted with a few 1,000-year-old limber pines."
15,2018-09-02,['hiking'],"Easy hike, nice views, lots of shade."
16,2018-08-17,[''],Easy hike with beautiful old trees and wild flowers. Lots of shade gentle incline.
17,2018-08-03,[''],Great hike to do with small kids. Fun to read different signs that talk about the ecosystem. Has a pretty view of the forest at top. Mostly shaded with easy incline and decline areas.

20,2018-07-17,['hiking'],This is a super fun and easy hike perfect for the family.  It is worth stopping if you are passing by.  It has lots of shade and signs that explain different landmarks and vegetation.  It is very easy.
21,2018-07-07,[''],This is a great hike! Great for all ages it can keep everyone's attention it has some great signs that kept my kids wanting to read more. It has benches along the way to take a break. It is a very beautiful hike.
22,2018-07-06,[''],Its a good easy hike to just get out side with the family.  A nice mix of forested areas and open meadows.
23,2018-06-28,[''],It is so beautiful and very easy for kids to hike! Definitely one I will go back to!
24,2018-06-26,['hiking'],"Perfect for easy kid hike!  Nice for the adults too, beautiful views, 560 year old Limber pine, wildflowers, interpretive signs to keep the kids interested, and a bit of up and down to make it seem like a hike to them.   Limited parking but usually enough unless you are there on a crowded weekend.  Plenty of flowers and the columbines are beautiful during late June.  Can be a bit cool since it is in the shade so bring a lite jacket or shirt for the kids.  Restrooms at the trail head.   Nice visitor center overlooking Bear Lake about a mile and a half down the road if you need better restrooms."

I didn't care it was considered easy  the trail has a calming effect."
41,2016-06-09,['hiking'],"Short, easy hike / walk for young hikers. Catches a slight glimpse of Bear Lake on a few points. Lots of learning points along the trail. Convenient access right off US 89 at the summit of Logan Canyon / Bear Lake."
