0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],Awesome hike! Beautiful weather!!! leave early 
1,2019-09-07,['hiking'],"I would highly recommend going all the way to sunset peak. it's not that much further and you can see all three lakes from a really high point of view. I would say the hardest part of the height is that first part getting up the ski slopes alongside the chair lifts. The hike is well worth it, I also saw 3 moose along the way. I would recommend hiking poles. "

3,2019-09-03,['hiking'],"Very busy; pretty wildflowers; stunning alpine lake views; highly recommend. Hiked Lakes Mary, Catherine, and Dog."
4,2019-09-02,['hiking'],Such a beautiful hike to view all 3 lakes. Plus Dog Lake.
5,2019-09-01,['hiking'],Great hike a Little rough in the beginning. But well worth it it’s beautiful at the top.
6,2019-08-29,['hiking'],Beautiful views! Lots of wildflowers. The lakes are gorgeous.  We went all the way up past 10k ft. past Lake Catherine. 
7,2019-08-29,['hiking'],"The most beautiful,  spectacular hike!!! The wildflowers and the lakes were out of this world!!! I am so glad I  was able to hike it!!! Truly it was amazing!"
8,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'snow']",Awesome views and a well maintained trail
9,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Go early, we only saw a few people on the trail on the way up. Basically had all 3 lakes to ourselves. "
10,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Amazing trail! Did it yesterday (Saturday August 24) with my sister. We started around 11 and finished around 5:30, taking lots of breaks. We also extended to climb up Sunset Peak, which offers a beautiful panorama of the area and the lakes. The highlight was seeing a mother and baby moose playing/running around in Lake Catherine. Also, between us we encountered two mosquitoes total (we didn't use bug spray), contrary to the warnings of other reviews. May be late enough in the season that they aren't as much of an issue. Highly recommended!"
11,2019-08-25,['hiking'],took my wife.  took us 1hr20 minutes to Lake Catherine.  decent hike. no moose today.  started hike at Brighton at 5:10 and reached Lake Catherine at 6:30.  slow and  steady pace. had light dinner and made it back to car at 8pm. sun was setting over Catherine as we left. 
12,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"We did it early afternoon (Sunday, August 25). A lot of wildflowers. All three lakes are beautiful. Met three mosquitoes and a very friendly chipmunk. Highly recommended!"
13,2019-08-24,"['hiking', 'rocky']","great trail. steep in places and rocky, but that's to be expected. ;) it was a fairly busy trail toward the evening (I hiked on a Friday). people were camping at some Lake Martha. saw some moose and lots of wildflowers. beautiful day!"
14,2019-08-22,['hiking'],amazing trail in the morning. can get chilly with the wind and elevation. worth every step.

16,2019-08-21,['hiking'],We started our hike at 8:30am. Only saw 4 other people the entire hike until we started descending past Lake Mary back to the car. At that point we saw about 20 other people just starting their hike. This was at 11:30am. Go early to avoid crowds. BE ON ALERT. Moose with baby spotted on the far side of Lake Catherine. She was laying down in a shaded area off trail and we did not see her until she stood up. We turned quickly and did not complete the loop. Wildflowers are just out of control beautiful!  The lakes are stunning. Bugs bad at Lake Catherine only.
17,2019-08-19,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
18,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"Very beautiful hike, so many flowers and three lakes. We extended the hike from Lake Catherine by climbing up a bit further to see Little Cottonwood Canyon. We also added a loop to the end adding a fourth lake to trip, Twin Lakes Reservoir. The whole trip took almost four hours with a lot of stops to take photos."
19,2019-08-18,['hiking'],Fun moderately easy hike. Lots of people on the weekend. Would recommend going during the week days. Getting to lake Mary is about 1.2 miles and then you can continue on to lake Catherine which I would definitely recommend. Not too difficult to get to lake Catherine and then you can keep going to peek some mountains if you want. Love this hike

21,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. The trail is well maintained. The first half mile to a mile is fairly steep, but it gets easier after that. There are TONS of wildflowers. There are also tons of mosquitoes, so make sure to bring bug repellant. "
22,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"Hiked on 8/17/19

Visited this trail after visiting Lake Mary.  Lake Catherine was stunning!  Lots of beautiful blooming wildflowers as you work your way to the lake.  Do note that there’s a fork path and you can take the left path to get to the lake faster.  Me and my buddy followed the right path of the fork and it took us longer to get to the lake, but it was okay at least :)"
23,2019-08-17,['hiking'],columbine are blooming 8/17/19

First, a correction on All Trails “Getting there” advice which is dated and incorrect. When you get to the Brighton loop drive to the far end of the loop and park in front of the building that says Brighton Center on the front. The trailhead is to the right of the building and to the left of a bulletin board. The trail starts out as a fine gravel path between landscape ties, NOT a cedar chip path. 
This is indeed a beautiful hike for the most part. I give it four stars only because much of the first mile is walking up the slopes of a ski resort. The steepness isn’t the issue. It’s just, well, a ski slope.  
Hikers should know that last stretch up to Lake Mary is very rocky and wet. Beware of slipping on wet stones. 
Lake Mary is beautiful, but the best part of the hike is from Lake Mary and Lake Catherine. The trail was less steep and surrounded by wildflowers. Lake Catherine is a true gem. 
A last note. If traveling from Park City as we did take Marsac Ave to Guardsman Pass Rd. Quite a scenic drive, but keep your eyes on the road. You will understand why as you climb. "

26,2019-08-15,['hiking'],"Pleasant hike. Lots of wild flower, pretty lakes"
27,2019-08-13,['hiking'],"Tues August 13, 2019 1pm. This was my first time hiking up the Brighton ""Lady Lakes"": Mary, Martha, Catherine. It was super pretty, a lot of wildflowers were out and the weather couldn't have been better. The alpine lakes are beautiful. It's an amazing hike seeing 3 lakes, wild flowers, and gorgeous vistas all within a little over 2 miles up. I put on bug spray before hiking and wasn't bothered at all. It was semi-busy but every single person I encountered was super friendly. The higher up I went the less people were there."
28,2019-08-12,['trail running'],Such a beautiful and well maintained trail. One of my favorites.
29,2019-08-12,['backpacking'],"beautiful trail! hiked up first week in August, a little hot on the way up in the middle of the day but cool in the morning. a couple beautiful spots to camp by the lake. definitely recommend for a day hike or quick backpack overnighter!"
30,2019-08-11,['hiking'],Busy for a good reason - beautiful.  Trail signs were lacking in the beginning. 
31,2019-08-09,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Be prepared for mosquitoes! The hike was pretty easy so we went to lake Martha and then that was a short hike so we ended up going to lake Catherine as well. Lake Catherine has some amazing views of the other lakes and beautiful wild flowers. We saw a lot of people backpacking up around 6
32,2019-08-07,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Beautiful hike. I thought the comments about the mosquitos were just Utahans (like myself now) who aren’t used to bugs, but they are no joke. We were eaten alive the first quarter mile, put on bug spray, and were fine after that."
33,2019-08-06,['hiking'],It’s always a beautiful hike to Lake Catherine.   I had on Deet so no bugs.  
34,2019-08-06,"['hiking', 'bugs']",The mosquitoes are out in force but the hike is worth it as long as you bring bug repellent. part of the trail requires you to hike through a stream to get up to Lake Mary.
35,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']",
36,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Gorgeous trail. Lots of mosquitos on the first half of the hike for me, but they were a bit better once I got up to Lake Catherine (in part thanks to a cool breeze). I brought bug spray with me and offered it to some grateful folks who were being eaten on the trail.

There was a bit of runoff just below Lake Mary, but easily passable (max 1"" deep). "
37,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs']","It’s steep at first! But, once you get past the first mile it’s easy after that. Make sure to bring bug spray! "
38,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
39,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Mosquitoes galore, bring the bug spray!"
40,2019-07-29,"['hiking', 'bugs']","First trail review.  Started this hike Sunday at 5pm and while I was moving intentionally fast, I was up and back by 7 with plenty of time for photos. The views were wonderful for such a short hike.  Mosquitos were an issue, but wearing pants, long sleeves, and keeping moving I came back with no bites and no repellant used.  You had about 20 seconds of standing still in some places before a mosquito found you.  

Very little snow that was avoidable at lake Catherine. A great trip, and multiple good lakes to stop at or turn around if you’re with people who are unsure of the longer hike. "
41,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Short steep hike. Full of mosquitos today. Had to turn back after first lake after many mosquito bites. They are well fed now. You may be luckier than me. You are welcome.
42,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs']",go early in the morning to beat the crowd
43,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'snow']",absolutely stunning. so glad I did this hike. went up and then around the third lake. first lake was my fav but the mosquitoes are man-eaters. took 1.5 hours round trip. 
44,2019-07-24,['hiking'],Quite a few people on the trail but less crowded once you get past Lake Mary. Hiked on Pioneer Day so probably similar to hiking on a weekend. I personally thought Lake Mary was prettiest but Martha and Catherine were nice too.
45,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Great trail that is accurately rated as moderate.  We did it with three of our grandkids the youngest being six years old.   The only bad thing was a lot of bugs.  We shared our bug spray with a lot of people who hadn’t brought any so we do recommend bug spray.  We started the hike at sunrise and were the first ones on the trail.  Go early if you want to beat the heat and the crowds. 
46,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'snow']",
47,2019-07-22,['hiking'],Gorgeous hike! Especially since it was 20° cooler than the valley. We continued up to one of the peaks above Lake Catherine. Stunning views of Little Cottonwood and the Heber Valley! 
48,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Wildflowers are just starting to open. Beautiful hike. Not too crowded for a Sunday.
49,2019-07-21,['hiking'],Awesome!
50,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"Such a cool escape from the valley temperature.
Enjoyed the views and the peacefulness. Wildflowers are starting to bloom as well.
Snow on parts of the trail, too.

Warning - Scores of bugs - gnats and misquotes were overwhelming!  "
51,2019-07-15,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes in BCC. Didn’t see a moose or bear but flowers are blooming!!!  So gorgeous this time of year. A little bit of snow just pass Lake Mary but not too bad. Make sure you have descent hiking shoes or it could be a little slippery in certain areas. 
52,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","was a little muddy and snowy, but nice hike! good workout! we saw deer and there were signs warning of a bear but we didnt see one :)"
53,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",This hike was a little harder than I expected due to the elevation. I’m from Phoenix. Such beautiful views. Lake Mary was my favorite but it was nice to make it all the way back to Lake Catherine. There was still snow on the trail and I wish we had our hiking shoes on. We were just in tennis shoes slipping around.so jealous someone else saw a moose out there today. We hoped we’d see one. 
54,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Great hike, beautiful lakes and we saw a Moose!"
55,2019-07-11,"['hiking', 'snow']","Still snow on parts of the trail, but we were able to make it up to Catherine."
56,2019-07-07,"['hiking', 'snow']","We hiked this trail today. It’s gorgeous every step of the way! We made it all the way to Lake Catherine, but there were some treacherous, snowy sections. Unfortunately, I didn’t have my spikes  (because JULY), but we were careful and managed with poles. When we got to Lake Catherine, it was partially frozen, and we couldn’t do the loop around the lake because there was so much snow. We went early and enjoyed the solitude. We had Lake Catherine all to ourselves! By the time we hiked back down to Lake Mary, it was swarming with people. Go early. Take spikes. Enjoy the view.  "
57,2019-07-06,['hiking'],Gorgeous but still quite a bit of snow and could not go past Lake Mary. 
58,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Just finished hike on 7/1/19. We started at 5:35am just before sunrise and the views when the sun started to illuminate the peaks was spectacular. We got to Lake Mary without any real issues. Some snow and mud but not too bad. The out of Lake Mary to the next lake was complete snow pack & very steep. Went 1/3 of the way up and decided it would be too slippery with picks or spike shoes. Had to come down backwards. Definitely a great hike and would definitely recommend. The 1st section seemed to be the steepest.
59,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"It was all snow, no trail. Super hard to find the trailhead as well. Don’t recommend "

61,2019-02-10,"['hiking', 'washed out']",
62,2018-10-29,[''],"Did this hike on 10/28/18. We made it to all three lakes. There was lots of snow, but most of it was packed in so you were not sinking down with every step. Wear proper hiking shoes and gear (we did not bring hiking poles but wish we did!). It was a gorgeous hike! The best part was that we were the only ones at Lake Catherine. I think the snow scared people off! Definitely recommend this hike."
63,2018-10-20,['hiking'],"Did this hike yesterday, or attempted to, anyway. Mary and Martha were absolutely gorgeous, but the trail to Catherine was completely covered in knee deep snow right at the loop. Probably could be done with snowshoes, but we did not have any. Scenery itself was beautiful despite not making it to Catherine. Can be easy to lose the trail in all of that snow.
Regardless, bring poles and/or spikes. Trail was nearly entirely covered in snow/ice."
64,2018-10-11,['hiking'],Really easy and really pretty. :)
65,2018-10-07,['hiking'],"Loved this hike! We live at sea level and did this right after getting off the plane in SLC, so the elevation was a bit tough in the beginning. We took it slow and steady until we felt better and would definitely recommend! It was a little crowded around the first lake, but thinned out a lot after that. Absolutely breathtaking views with a very cool mix of snow and fall foliage. Saw a deer, wood pecker, several chipmunks, and moose poo but sadly no moose. :-)"
66,2018-10-06,['hiking'],"Went on a Friday morning while vacationing right after the first snowfall. We are from central Florida, and it was worth every lungful of oxygen we struggled to get as we made the climb. One of the best hikes I’ve ever been  on."
67,2018-10-02,['hiking'],"Went on a weekday after work, after it had rained enough to dampen the trail a little bit. There were only a handful of people on the whole trail, but lots of wildlife...~15 deer and 1 porcupine!  The fall colors are still there and the lakes were beautiful. 
Steady up and down, no real flat sections."
68,2018-10-01,['hiking'],"Fairly busy trail that takes you to 3 small lakes. The trailhead wasn’t that clear on the map provided with this app, so we just drove in the general direction and followed everyone else hoping they were heading to Lake Mary. Start by the big sign that says Thank You for riding Brighton and you’ll see just up ahead a wooden sign that confirmed we were on the right trail. Plenty of parking here. Be prepared with water. There plenty of elevation gain but I wouldn’t say any of it is too steep for too long. If your not a serious hiker, take your time, pace yourself with the slowest of the group and stop and rest. It’s worth the extra climb up to Catherine. It was my favorite of the 3. We had young kids in our group and we did the loop in 5 hours with probably an hour total of relaxing at Mary and Catherine, eating lunch and just hanging out. People had hammocks along the trail but I did see a group being told to take them down by a youngish girl, not quite sure who she was or what authority she had, or did I see anywhere stating rules against hanging them. Looked like a nice way to enjoy the peace of the mountains though."
69,2018-09-24,['hiking'],"This trail is a zoo up to Lake Mary, crowded and not super pretty  with a view of the dam until you get up to Lake Mary.  Lake Mary is a pretty lake.  As is typical, once you get past 0.5 miles all of the crowds go away.  After that it was beautiful, nice view down to Martha and then beautiful at Catherine. This is an easy hike overall.  Fall colors are amazing. Oh and it hailed last night. Walk down and sunset colors were amazing.  5 for the natural beauty, 2 for the crowds to Mary."
70,2018-09-22,['camping'],"Sooo incredible. Perfect temps, great scenery, pretty easy hike too. Took the whole fam and kids had no trouble making the hike carrying their own packs. Their ages range from 7 to 12. Also had some fun little trails for us to explore in the morning around the lake too."
71,2018-09-09,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. The entire way there is just so much to see. The mountains themselves are exquisite. We saw deer and moose off the trail. On the way to Catherine you pass lake Mary. Made a mental note to come back and camp overnight at Lake Mary. It would be an easy backpacking trip in and out.
72,2018-09-08,[''],"We hiked up and camped at Lake Catherine. It took us about 1.5 hours. Great spot with a relatively short hike (about 2 miles up). The trail was pleasant. The views of Lake Catherine, Mary, and Mary were so nice. We went up the first week of September and the leaves were just starting to turn."
73,2018-09-04,[''],Been on many hard hikes and wanted an easier one. Loved this trail. Was not strenuous at all. Saw a moose just chilling in the middle of the trail. Such beautiful scenery and well worth the small effort this takes to get to the lakes. The lakes were absolutely breath taking.
74,2018-09-03,[''],Very busy today but Lake Catherine was so worth it.  If we didn’t have the kids we would have continued up to Sunset Peak.  Saw a mama and baby moose bedded for hours in the grass. Beautiful!
75,2018-09-03,['hiking'],Amazing trail kinda busy but my 4 year old rock star loved it.
76,2018-09-01,[''],Loved this hike. Lake Catherine by far the most beautiful. Very peaceful place to sit on the shoreline and take in all the beauty and sounds of nature.
77,2018-08-30,['hiking'],"One of the most beautiful hikes I’ve been on. After the deep woods of the Wasatch you eventually come upon two lakes surrounded by rocky, craggy mountaintops.  Look northeast and you’ll see Park City’s Jupiter Peak and Scott Hill.

Once you get to Lake Catherine, there are several other trails if you want to continue your adventure. I headed west up the ridge between Sunset Peak and Mount Wolverine. Next time I plan to hike up to both peaks for more spectacular views. Right over the top of the ridge is a trail down to the Albion Basin in Alta. 

Finally, I went pretty early and get started at 8 AM and was alone most of the way. When I came back down the trail started getting busier."
78,2018-08-24,[''],Beautiful hike!
79,2018-08-20,['hiking'],"A beautiful trail that starts up with a wide open incline across ski hills. Then you get to the forested area and it’s beautiful plus you see 3 alpine lakes.  Stop at Lake Martha to look for deer and moose hiding on the left side of the small lake.  Lots of hikers but still opportunities to see marmots, squirrels, chippies and a few deer and moose."
80,2018-08-13,['hiking'],"Maybe a bit more moderate than easy going uphill, but it was a beautiful trail. The first Lake was so big and peaceful. Nice quiet trail but definitely more traffic on it by early afternoon."
81,2018-08-10,['backpacking'],"I’ve done his trail twice. It’s really good. Well trafficked so if you get hurt there’s someone close by to help. The downside is that it’s well trafficked so you’re never really alone. Ok the bright side, great cellphone coverage. At least on T-Mobile. I assume Verizon and AT&T’s coverage will be just as good. 

It’s a fun trail. Do it in the morning. It gets hot in the summer afternoon."
82,2018-08-04,['hiking'],Did this hike this morning and loved it! So beautiful.
83,2018-07-31,['hiking'],"Hiked this early Sunday morning.  We started at 7AM and were back down around 10AM at a nice and easy pace.  It was getting really busy as we were almost done, but before that it was peaceful and quiet.  Beautiful trail.  Definitely a good moderate hike.  With a little wandering around I ended up clocking around 5.5 miles."
84,2018-07-30,['hiking'],Did this one yesterday and it took about 2 hours to make it to the top. My 4 year old was able to do the whole hike himself and the views at the top are breathtaking. Definitely a good family hike.
85,2018-07-29,['hiking'],"Fun hike with beautiful wild flowers.  Depending on your fitness level, easy to moderate.  We got there at 7am and only saw 4 other people.   Pretty busy on the way down.  We took it slow on the way up, and stopped a lot to take pics of flowers.  With one minor detour it took us 2 hours to get up and one hour to get down."
86,2018-07-29,['hiking'],Very good hike 
87,2018-07-27,['hiking'],I love this one!! Start from Brighton and you’ll be able to see all three lakes. It’s a great hike for families that will still give a tiny bit of challenge. Bring bug spray!
88,2018-07-23,[''],It is a moderate or Maybe because it was my first hike this season. The lakes are beautiful. I am thankful to witness this beauty of nature . It is so quiet and relaxing up there. I have enjoyed it .
89,2018-07-19,['hiking'],Easy out and back with nice views of the lake.
90,2018-07-17,['hiking'],"Great trail. Started at 6:00am, saw 3 moose, 3 deer, and the trail loop around the east of Catherine had fresh mountain lion tracks. Bugs were out but with bug spray no issue. (July 15)

As two younger males, it took us 1.5 hrs to do the whole trail. We continued on past Lake Catherine to the Sunset Peak trail, which was steeper. To the top of Sunset Peak took another hour with stops and it was worth the extra climb."
91,2018-07-15,[''],"Did this hike on Saturday July 14th. Started at 7:30 am which was perfect since by the time we were coming back down it was getting really crowded. Somehow we ended up going 6.9 miles, not 4.4, but we did take a random trail at the end towards lake Catherine that took us the back way around. Still doesn't seem to add up though. I'm pretty out of shape and we also stopped to take lots of pics of the beautiful wildflowers, so it took us about 2.5 hours to get up (also had a 15-20 minute break at Lake Mary) and an hour to get back down. Dog Lake was first which was more of a swamp, Lake Mary was next and absolutely beautiful. Lake Martha also felt more swamp esque but provided some good scenery as you continue towards Lake Catherine. The flowers were unreal, but so we're the mosquitoes, so definitely pack some bug spray! All in all I would definitely recommend since despite the steep incline right off the bat, the lakes are such a high payoff. We also saw 2 moose on the way back down!"
92,2018-07-12,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail last night and it was very nice. Getting to the lakes was always a huge payoff. The mosquitoes were awful though, don’t even consider hiking without bug spray."
93,2018-07-10,[''],"Loved this hike! Starts at the bottom of Brighton resort and leads you to see lake Mary, Martha, and Catherine. Took 1 hour up and 45 minutes down. So many wildflowers this time of year and it’s absolutely breathtaking the whole way up!"
94,2018-07-03,['backpacking'],Really nice. Lots of people.  Gorgeous weather and scenery. Would highly recommend.
95,2018-07-01,['hiking'],"The mountain wildflowers are starting to go off and I have never seen Lake Mary this full of water! We hiked this on Saturday, June 30 and somehow I missed the memo that there was a trail running race going on at Brighton, but the racers weren’t on the Brighton Lakes trail. Ignoring the amount of people present for the event, the trail was still fairly crowded with families & kids until we reached Lake Mary. There weren’t as many people on the remaining trail to Lake Catherine. This is still one of my go-to hikes, but I may not do it on the middle of a Saturday if it’s solitude that your looking for"
96,2018-06-29,['hiking'],"I would call this a moderate hike. Today, June 23rd, almost all of the snow has melted off the trail. The south side of the loop around Catherine was a little difficult with fisherman blocking the narrow and slanted trail."
97,2018-06-27,[''],
98,2018-06-26,[''],"What an amazing hike!  Super beautiful.  Flowers and starting to bloom, and there is some fun snow to make it interesting but not difficult.  We turned after the dam to the left trail and walked along the Northside of Lake Mary on the way back and then also caught twin lakes making 5 lakes in all if you count Dog lake. Great route, and the cliffs on that route back were so pretty. Here is a 360 degree  visual of my hike if you want to check it out. https://shaunasadventures.blogspot.com/2018/06/360-adventure-hike-to-lake-mary-martha.html?m=1"
99,2018-06-24,['hiking'],"Gorgeous lakes, impossible to not love this trail."
100,2018-06-17,['backpacking'],"For a first time backpacker this was the perfect trip! The views were spectacular and the hike was easy enough for someone inexperienced. We got there fairly late on Friday evening around 8 pm and we made it to lake Catherine before 9 pm. It was really windy during the night. There are plenty of great places to set up camp around the lake. If you’re looking for a fun quick overnight trip, this place is great!"
101,2018-06-12,[''],I love this hike. It was beautiful up there today. There were a few spots with some snow but it was nothing unmanageable. I had micro spikes so I threw them on but it was totally doable without them.
102,2018-06-11,[''],Still snowy in parts but doable and beautiful!
103,2018-06-02,['hiking'],We hiked to Lake Mary and Lake Martha on 5/31/2018 and really wanted to also see Lake Catherine.  There is still lots of snow on the trail.  We had spikes which helped a lot but still we did not make it all the way to Lake Catherine. Nevertheless this is a great hike. The lakes are very picturesque settled in their granite bowls.  We will be back after the snow melt.
104,2018-02-15,[''],"Great hike, awesome views and landscapes, great exercise. The hike wasn’t to bad, only five miles up and down, we really didn’t have any problem getting up there, except for exhaustion.
Anyway, great hike loved it!"
105,2017-10-22,['hiking'],"Good hike this morning to Lake Catherine. On the way, you’ll pass Dog Lake and Lakes Mary and Martha. It’s also fun (easily manageable without crampons) to hike in the snow."
106,2017-10-22,[''],"Great hike. It had just snowed the day before. That extra layer of snow gave a good crunch under the feet going up, but coming down was more muddy and slippery.  We went with our five kids (10,9,6,5,5) and grandma.  The snow on the way down was difficult for grandma, but we walked down together to minimize slips. Kids did fine. I carried one on my shoulders off and on much of the way down due to cold feet. No clearly marked trail head, but you figure it out from the parking lot pretty easily. We didn’t see any moose. Lake Mary was gorgeous, with some great picture spots for sure. I didn’t love hiking along the chair lift for that first section though. You lose a bit of the magic, but it’s still awesome. Next time we’ll go all the way to Lake Catherine for sure"
107,2017-10-22,['hiking'],"My husband and I felt that this was our favorite hike of our short trip to the Wasatch Mountains. It is more of a moderate hike, like many have said, but it was by no means impossible to do. We felt challenged enough and each lake was spectacular! Fortunately, we did this hike prior to the snow that came later in the afternoon yesterday. After Lake Martha, it was slippery with a lot of ice, but probably not as icy as it could be now. Like past reviews have said, the hike from the base to Lake Mary was the most challenging part. Because this was our first time in the Wasatch Mountains, we wanted to see a lot and stopped at Lake Catherine. Next time we come out, we plan to go all the way up!"
108,2017-10-13,[''],Amazing views!
109,2017-09-07,['hiking'],Fantastic lake and worth it to go all the way to Catherine and not stop at Mary
110,2017-08-22,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, lots of photo ops and lunch spots.  I would classify this more of a moderate hike for those new to the area, the first part to Lake Mary had me puffing a bit.  I made the mistake of taking the right branch at the fork after Lake Martha and ended up above Lake Catherine...very pretty, so worth the mistake."
111,2017-08-20,['hiking'],"Classic Wasatch trail with stunning views and wildflowers. Can be pretty heavily trafficked on the weekends during the summer. This is the trail out of Brighton at mile 75 of the Wasatch 100 Mile Endurance Run, so it was always a welcome friend. Trail up from Lake Martha to Lake Catherine is wide, smooth, and not very steep - so it's fun to run down. In the summer I'd leave a fishing pole hidden up at Lake Catherine and enjoy a break there."
112,2017-08-19,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful trail with good vistas.  A reasonable amount of uphill hiking and rocky areas.  I would recommend a pole or two for the hike down although we managed fine without them.  I would call this a moderate hike.
113,2017-08-19,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful trail. Wildflowers everywhere.  Wouldn't classify this trail as easy, more moderate, but very doable.  Lots of sun exposure which makes it feel hotter but still nice out.  Saw 3 moose out today, 2 bulls and 1 female.  Lake Mary is the prettiest of the 3 but the views from the end are awesome!"
114,2017-08-18,[''],Simple and beautiful!
115,2017-08-16,[''],Really beautiful hike. It was steep up to Lake Mary. After that it wasn't bad to Lake Catherine. Went to Dog Lake on the way down. Saw a big bull moose. Lots of wildflowers.
116,2017-08-11,[''],"Such a great hike! Beautiful flowers, awesome sights!!"
117,2017-08-04,[''],Got there and went right up to sunset peak... I'm not the best hiker and it was doable with little breaks along the way!
118,2017-07-30,['hiking'],Loved this hike! Lake Mary and Lake Catherine are gorgeous. The wildflowers are incredible this time of year.
119,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"The wild flowers were beautiful. We finished by 11, before it got too hot. However, we started out freezing cold, so I'd bring a light jacket. The mosquitoes were pretty intense when near any of the three lakes, but not too bothersome if we kept moving."
120,2017-07-27,[''],Beautiful views and loved all the wild flowers.
121,2017-07-25,['hiking'],
122,2017-07-24,['hiking'],"As you can tell from the number of reviews, this is a popular hike. I went early in the morning and hardly saw anyone, and sadly, no moose. The hardest part is the first .5 or so miles climbing up the ski slopes from the Brighton base. Once you get off the slopes it is pretty quick to Lake Mary, which is full and really pretty right now. A few mosquitoes, even at Catherine pass. When you get up to Catherine Pass, above Lake Catherine, it's not that much further to the top of Sunset Peak. It looks daunting, but the trail is actually quite straightforward and short."
123,2017-07-24,['hiking'],"There are numerous types of wildflowers in the trail. Chipmunks and birds dot the entire trail. The clear waters of L. Catherine are spectacular. We actually did it as a loop by taking the right at Dog Lake deviation to Lakes Mary and Martha, then a hike upward to Catherine followed by a different route in return, but a very clear trail, to meet the trails at the Dog Lake. There are lots of mosquitoes in the evening, take some spray with you."
124,2017-07-21,['hiking'],"Pretty good trail. Not too tough, kinda busy depending what time of the day/week you go. Nice views of the lake. Make sure to check out dog lake while you're there."

still a few snowy parts getting to Catherine but totally doable."
128,2016-11-12,[''],Very pretty and VERY easy hike.
129,2016-10-26,[''],Lake Martha sits just past lake Mary on your way to lake Catherine! Easy hike from lake Mary to Catherine. Hardly any snow
130,2016-09-13,['hiking'],"One of the trails with scenic views and variety which can be easily done in an afternoon. Lots of traffic, at times too much swimming/ jumping/ campfire (also prohibited). iof looking for peace don't go on a weekend!"
131,2016-09-08,['hiking'],"Any type of shoes will do. It's not particularly challenging, and there are a lot of connecting trails (Twin Lakes, Dog Lake, Wolverine Peak, Sunset Summit, etc.)"
132,2016-09-06,['hiking'],Nice hike. Saw 4 moose. Would rate this trail as more of moderate in parts. Great views of you continue on to sunset peak.
133,2016-09-03,[''],"Beautiful scenery, a little bit more populated than alternative hikes... But all in all, totally worth it!"
134,2016-08-28,['hiking'],Lake Catherine and the trail to Catherine's Pass and up to Sunset Peak were stunning!  Can't wait to do it again.
135,2016-08-27,['hiking'],"Steep in parts but beautiful with lots of wildlife (moose, deer). It's worth it to hike up past Catherine's Pass for the views of Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons. Lake Mary is mostly empty still."
136,2016-08-21,[''],Loved seeing some wildlife.
137,2016-08-20,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. A bit crowded on a weekend. Try and go mid-week. Saw 4 moose. Take binoculars.
138,2016-08-11,['hiking'],"Gorgeous. I'd give it a moderate though. Go early, lots and lots and lots of people."
139,2016-08-10,['hiking'],"Sheila and I started up to Sunset Peak at 05:30 on a Wednesday.  We ran across Deer, Grouse and a Bull Moose. We were there on Sunday but, didn't make the Peak. Went back this morning to finish our hike. Advise (go earlier in the morning)."

144,2016-07-12,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike and not too crowded in the morning but there were a lot of people going up around 11:00-12:00 as i was coming down. A lot of wildflowers have bloomed and we saw a few deer. There were some annoying teenagers ignoring the posted ""no swimming"" signs and cliff jumping into Lake Mary despite it being a watershed (yes we video taped them and reported it to the forest service). Aside from those idiots, lovely hike."
145,2016-07-10,[''],easy hike. took 3 year old. he gave up and carried him most of the was. lots of  people.
146,2016-07-10,['backpacking'],Trail is beautiful and easy enough for my ten yr old to carry his own pack. However the mosquitos are outlandish. Couldn't stand still without being swarmed. It was unbearable. We packed up quickly before breakfast and booked it out of there.
147,2016-07-05,['fishing'],Started at Brighton ski resort. I took my 6 years-old son and he did great. You will pass lake Mary heading up which I feel is the better Lake in that area to hike to. Trail was easy but steep and there is hardly any shade so I would pack some sunscreen. I could take my 3 and 4 years-old easy. We also took our fishing poles up and spent a few hours but never caught anything. I talked with other people there who were fishing and no one seemed to have any luck. Bugs were out in full force but luckily I had taken some bug repellent. Overall fun hike with little shade which I would do again with the family but I would probably just hike to Lake Mary next time.
148,2016-07-03,['hiking'],Great early morning hike to Pioneer Peak
149,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Really beautiful scenery, decent uphill but not too strenuous.  Saw a moose at the last lake!"
150,2016-06-30,[''],"I was worried in the beginning that it wouldn't be a nice trail. Heavy exposure to sun and not much to look at. However, once you make it out of the ski lift area it turns really nice. Lake Mary is beautiful and we saw a moose at the small lake right after Lake Mary. We continued up to Lake Catherine and the views and scenery were fantastic. Stopped for a snack at Lake Catherine and turned around. Hiked this with my two children (8 & 6). They did great. We took our time and finished in around 3 hours with lots of stops to look at rocks, take pictures and have a snowball fight."
151,2016-06-23,['hiking'],We loved this trail from Brighton to Lake Mary and then on to Lake Katherine. Had to cross 5-6 patches of wet snow which had not expected but once we got there it was well worth the trek. Gorgeous views.
152,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"It was a nice hike especially to get out of the summer heat in the valley. There is still snow covering parts of the trail once you get past Lake Mary. The ground is wet, muddy, snowy, slushy icy and you need to be very careful in some parts. We saw a couple of people biff it right on their butts and they were lucky they weren't on the thinest steepest part of the trail just before you get to Lake Catherine. Whatever you do outdoors play it safe. Great hike beautiful scenery and the pine smell in the air is amazing!"
153,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"Great hike! There was still some snow on the ground, resulting some precarious crossings. Great views, moderately trafficked, little shade but not a ton."
154,2016-01-03,['hiking'],"Definitely a ""leisurely hike and packed lunch"" kind of place to go. If you're lucky you'll catch some muledeer hanging out by the water."
155,2015-11-09,['hiking'],Fun hike not to difficult but the snow packed and icy trial made it much harder than normal. Crampons would have been a big benefit for today. Got a little windy but as long as you are dressed for the weather it was fine. Mary was drained for the work on the locks so that was disappointing and the other lakes were almost completely covered in snow.  It still had some beautiful view and was not busy at all today.
156,2015-10-15,[''],It was super fun! The trails really as far as you want to go! And it's a very easy hike to take anyone on.
157,2015-09-21,[''],"One of the best day hikes in the Wasatch.  Ditch the Brighton crowds at Lake Mary and you'll be rewarded with solitude for the most part.  Moose are common, as are bugs, and people, so I recommend the hike in early Fall."
158,2015-09-02,[''],"I would have rated it higher but Lake Mary is drained right now so I was definitely somewhat disappointed. I'm not sure where the 2.9 miles round trip comes from but much further than that. Still, absolutely worth it! Stunning views of other lakes and scenery and Lake Catherine is beautiful! I will go back next year when the construction is complete on Lake Mary so I can have the full effect!"
159,2015-08-24,[''],"My friend and I loved this hike, we went in July and the wild flowers around the lake and trails were beautiful."
160,2015-08-19,['hiking'],"The first part of the trail is kind of tough, but it levels out somewhat eventually.  It seems like a lot of people stop at Lake Mary, but we felt like the extra effort to get to Lake Catherine was worth it.  Sitting on the shores, it was so quiet and peaceful... thinking about it makes me want to go back!"
161,2015-08-18,[''],Amazing views. Not too hard for kids.
162,2015-08-10,['hiking'],"I loved this hike! Some parts could be rated moderate but pretty easy for the most part so don't worry you'll be fine. Saw some baby deer. The lakes were beautiful, great views. Bring bug spray. Go early or it's crowded."
163,2015-08-03,[''],Tougher bottom section for the littler kids but great mix of views and terrain. Accessible for hikers of all levels. Some great spots to backpack into for camping if you enjoy a night away from the city.
164,2015-08-02,['hiking'],Great hike for great views.
165,2015-08-02,['hiking'],Iexcellent hike
166,2015-07-27,['hiking'],"This is one of the most popular hikes in Utah, so you're bound to run into plenty of people, but the lakes are beautiful."
167,2015-07-07,[''],"Such a beautiful hike! It was nice seeing all three lakes at one time. It was a bit buggy at Lake Katherine, but it was the perfect weather. Definitely go early!"
168,2015-07-06,['camping'],Beautiful hike. Very busy. Took are 3 boys and stayed overnight. Bring bug spray.
169,2015-06-28,['hiking'],I would say Lake Mary is by far the prettiest out of Mary Martha and Catherine. Its always a fun an enjoyable time to do the hike to Lake Mary. Try to go on weekdays and either go super early in the morning or late in the afternoon as the trail gets super hot during the summer. If you go during the weekdays you'll get much more solitude and avoid large crowds.
170,2015-06-24,[''],"Great and easy, we went to Catherine Pass... Gorgeous views!!!"
171,2015-06-23,['hiking'],"At the beginning of the trail head, the incline is a little steep, but after about a quarter mile it levels out. Due to all of the recent rain, this trail is simply gorgeous. By the end you'll pass three lakes: Mary, Martha, and Catherine. Up until you reach Lake Martha, the trail can be quite crowded (but it was also Father's Day). From Mary to Catherine you have a chance of seeing a considerable amount of snow. When I went, the banks of Lake Catherine were covered in snow and made the lake even more incredible to see."
172,2015-06-23,['hiking'],"Doing the first quarter mile, I was slightly worried that I wouldn't make it. But it levels out after that and makes for a relatively easy but beautiful hike. To put things in perspective, this is my second week out of a brace after tearing some tendons aka I haven't worked out at all in two months. I may have taken a lot of breaks but I made it up in about 70 minutes or so."
173,2015-05-23,[''],Love this trail.
174,2014-09-01,['hiking'],"Good trail, pretty busy, especially from the trailhead up to Lake Mary. Beautiful lakes."
175,2014-08-16,[''],Easy trail and gorgeous views. Lots of shade. Waterfall on the way.
176,2014-07-10,['hiking'],"Enjoyed this hike. Way too many people up until Lake Mary, especially for a weekday. But once you get past that lake, it definitely thins out. Saw 2 moose which was awesome. We hiked a bit past Lake Catherine to get a good view. The most challenging part of the hike is the first 1/4 mile and that's only because it's a steeper incline. After that, it levels out. I wish the entire hike would have been a bit more of a challenge. Also, bring bug spray! I made that mistake. I would do this hike again if I were with somebody who wasn't in good shape. Otherwise, I'm good with it being a one time hike!"
177,2013-09-27,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes. The first bit until Lake Mary can be a little ugly and overcrowded but once you get past Mary you almost seem to have the mountain to yourself. From the junction just before Lake Catherine you can take the trail to the right and get up on top of Catherine Pass. From there it's a short hike to the top of Sunset Peak where you can see all three lakes right in a row. 
178,2013-08-26,['hiking'],"There are 2 ways up to Lake Catherine. The one most talked about here is from Brighton, up past lakes Mary and Martha. The other is from Alta, up and over Catherine Pass. I have done both with scout groups and found them to be very similar in elevation gain and distance. I don't know if I'd call either Black Diamond steep, but each follows a path that is no more than a Blue Square steady incline as you hike the slopes of the respective ski resorts on either side. Whichever route you choose, I'll second the motion to hike the extra .5 mile from Catherine Pass to Sunset Peak for an awesome view of all three lakes and a 360 degree panorama of the entire area!"
179,2013-08-12,['hiking'],"First 3/4 mile is fairly steep in places, from there it gets really easy imho. All four lakes on this trail are amazing in their own right, and there is ample opportunity to see Moose all along the route, so stay alert. It can get busy at times, but I'd say it's medium use compared to a few other hikes I've done in the Wasatch this year, like Blanche and Stewart Falls. If you feel extra motivated, this trail is also an excellent access point for Sunset Peak which provides quite amazing views of the lakes and basins. Insects can be an issue, so be sure to bring repellant!"
180,2013-07-28,['hiking'],"This is a great hike. One of my favorites so far. Lake Mary is a popular spot. Just up the trail was Lake Martha. Three moose were hanging out and drawing a lot of attention. Further up you eventually get to Lake Katherine. Don't miss it. Once near the lake the trail forks, left will take you to the Lake and straight will take you to the pass. Flowers were blooming and the colors and views were  great. "
181,2013-07-28,['hiking'],If you like crowds this trail is a must do.....so is a walk around Mid Town Manhattan. LOL   Trail is a well worn dirt (dust) path.  Lake is scenic but you can't swim or pee in it.  Only the wildlife is allowed to foul the watershed.  We hiked this on a Monday and had to see at least sixty people.
182,2013-07-16,['hiking'],"loved this hike.Started out early to beat heat & crowds. At the almost empty parking lot we saw 3 savvy older women spraying themselves down with bugspray, we later wished we had some. The first part of the trail is straight up a ski slope but it levels out nicely after that. Fabulous views, tons of wildflowers!! I wouldnt bring kids under 7 on this unless they are VERY fit!"
183,2013-07-07,['hiking'],"We took the trail to Lake Mary from Brighton Ski Resort on a Thursday afternoon. The trail is well used as Lake Mary is an easy retreat from the heat and only a short hike. From Lake Mary, continue on the trail to Lake Martha. The trail continues up and over to Lake Catherine. Watch for moose on the trail once you get to the lake - we saw one in the shrubs. There is a little spring and a great view of Lake Mary and Martha just before you come into Lake Mary. The trail continues to Albion Basin and Alta."
184,2013-06-22,['hiking'],This is a great hike anytime
185,2013-06-08,['hiking'],Hiked the trail today 6/8/13. It's mostly snowbanks from Lake Martha to Lake Catherine. You better be good at finding the trail especially at the first switchback. Saw no-one on the trail above Lake Mary..
186,2013-05-05,['hiking'],Would this be a bad hike to do for Mother's Day? Or would the scenery be some what died? 
187,2012-09-03,['hiking'],"This hike was absolutely amazing!   The scenic views and rock formations were so beautiful.  We hiked up from Snowbird Ski Resort and Headed down to Lake Catherine and then to the overlook where you can view Lake Mary and Lake Martha.  It was an incredible view! I would like to point out that on this sight, Lake Catherine is listed as Easy.  I would have to say that it was moderate to demanding.  An incredible workout was appreciated.  I would not move forward with this hike depending on a person's possible disability (walking or hiking) due to the incline and rocks on the trail because I feel the EASY rating was rather inaccurate.  I look forward to doing this trail in May when all the flowers have bloomed.  We did need jackets and blankets this morning when we reach Snowbird to begin. "
188,2012-08-23,[''],"Very scenic hike. A few nice over looks on the way up. The innitial start from Brighton, as you pass under the ski lifts is blah, but it gets real nice after about .6 mile. The fly fishing was fantastic for smallish brook trout in August. And I was lucky enough to see a cow moose and her calf come down for a drink, and hang out at the lake for a couple hours!"
189,2012-08-08,['hiking'],Yea Jackson Hill there is great fishing in this lake every time I go camping over night I limit out both days ( brook trout) use power bait or worms.  
190,2012-07-25,['hiking'],"A little more strenuous than I expected, but the wildflowers were amazing!  I'm not the most active person in the world either, so take the time detail for what its worth :)"
191,2012-07-24,['camping'],"Lake Catherine is my favorite easy backpacking/overnighter hike, so we could see the sun rise from Sunset Peak the following morning.  Just did this one again, but this time with my 16-year-old son Eric.  We found the perfect campsite just 80 feet to the south of the big lake, accessible by the trail from the top of Catherine Pass.  Perfect scenery, fair weather, some mosquitoes, very warm.  Laid atop my sleeping bag for much of the night.  With AT&T we both got three bars, and made calls and texts easily from our campsite.  We were only accompanied by one other group, who camped on the north shore, since the rest of the crowd camped at the base of Sunset Peak."
192,2012-07-07,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite hikes. The perfect scenery. Good for all levels of hiking. 
193,2011-01-19,['hiking'],"Cathrine was a lovely girl. Easy, well rounded, loose. I just wish I could find where to blow the into her."
