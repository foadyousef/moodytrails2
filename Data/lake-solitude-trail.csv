0,2019-09-03,['hiking'],"This particular lake is more a small pond. We hiked it by making a loop from Twin Lakes. The trail between the two was beautiful and fun, with good views of the mountains around. I wouldn’t make Lake Solitude a destination hike unless paired with Twin Lakes. "
1,2019-09-02,['hiking'],Wonderful trail with a loop of Lake Solitude at the end. Mostly in and out of shade but there are a few spots of full sun. 
2,2019-08-27,['hiking'],"About 2.5 hr round trip with a 4 year old. Lots of  shade in the morning. Fairly straightforward terrain and a nice mix of plain dirt trail, some rocks, and some roots. Nothing particularly wet in late August. Trail ends at Lake Solitude, which is fine but this is more about the journey than the destination. There is a small cave on the east side of the lake. "
3,2019-08-27,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. Lots of wild flowers!
4,2019-08-26,['hiking'],"Started this one around 5:00pm. Very secluded trail, but it’s shared with mountain bikers. We went up and connected over to twin lakes. I’m surprised there isn’t a loop trail option. When I figure out how to add one I’ll get on it! The whole loop took 2 hours, but I’m not a speedy hiker. "
5,2019-08-12,['hiking'],Dry with a couple of wet spots. Didn't encounter any bugs. Went around 6 pm and didn't run into a ton of people once I hit the split for the lake. Well marked with signs and easy to follow. 
6,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Beautiful sunset hike, flowers in full bloom. Well maintained trail, you will not be disappointed. Mosquitoes in full force. "
7,2019-07-24,['hiking'],Pioneer Day hike. Beautiful. Trail is well.marked and in good condition. 
8,2019-07-20,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Very nice trail and very well-marked which I appreciate! The lake isn't much to look at, but it's a fun destination!"
9,2019-07-17,['hiking'],"Excellent young family hike and perfect for out of town visitors that aren't used to the local ""easy"" hikes being so steep or the elevation! 
My three kids, 6 and under were all able to keep up.
Lots of offshoot trails but the actual one is very clearly marked the whole way. Get there early to avoid the silver lake crowds though!
Also, KEEP YOUR DOGS AT HOME.. love dogs, but follow the rules...and the 20 signs posted while driving up the canyon. "
10,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Fairly moderate hike with an abundance of wildflowers. A handy pocket wildflower guide is your best friend. 
11,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"Coming from a middle aged novice hiker, this is a great trail. Lots of shade and not too steep. There aren’t any fantastic vistas but the lake is pretty and the trees are amazing. "
12,2019-07-10,['hiking'],"My perfect setting—hiking over rocks and boulders, inbetween swaying aspen trees as you approach the lake. Trees, rocks, outdoor hiking  in the mountains.  What’s not to love...."
13,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"Snow is now gone except for a few patches.  A little run off still on the trail if you continue up to twin lake.  Twin lake is definitely worth the bit of extra hike if you're able, much prettier lake and views. "
14,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'snow']",Still lots of snow on the trail. You can't see the trail a lot of the way so make sure you've downloaded the map. Spikes not needed but poles were helpful. Will do this again in a few more weeks to be able to actually follow the trail.
15,2018-11-06,[''],"Did the hike just after sunrise on 11/3. We were the first ones out and back after a snowfall from the previous night, so we ended up losing track of the trail a lot. (Easy hike in the fresh snow powder, just hard to follow the true trail with so many side trails) The lake was completely frozen over but not yet completely snow covered. Looking forward to coming back in the summer."
16,2018-10-27,['hiking'],"Great hike. This trail has a bit of everything. Snow, mud, rocks, wildlife...and other hikers.

Sometimes the beaten path is slightly different than the actual red-marked trail in this app. I veered off slightly and wound up backtracking twice. Pay attention to the app so you don’t veer too far. 

I added the Silver Lake trail to my hike and finished at 5 miles flat. Had I not veered off I think I would have finished this hike at 4 miles."
17,2018-10-24,[''],"Beautiful hike! Quite snowy, but worth it! Hiked in the snow around the lake and then back down. definitely will go again!"
18,2018-09-24,[''],Really nice hike...saw a bunch of deer around sunset when we went...saw a few people on the way there and back but didn’t feel crowded at all.
19,2018-09-23,[''],went early morning hardly no one around and saw lots of wild life. It got very busy around 9am.
20,2018-09-22,[''],"Great hike, easy to moderate. With the weather being so dry for so long, not much of a lake. Did run into a deer and moose along the way, it was a lot of fun. Next time we will hike on to Twin Lakes."
21,2018-09-18,['hiking'],"Not busy. Pretty rocky in spots. Stay to the right on the board walk to find trail head. Lots of shade. Enjoyable, relatively easy hike"
22,2018-09-14,['hiking'],"Our first hike as a young family in the Wasatch Range, and we loved it! Perfect for folks looking for an easier hike. My wife and I were able to take our 5-month old on the entire trek using a Bjorn baby carrier without any trouble. She loved the mountain air!"
23,2018-08-28,['hiking'],Hiked to the Lake early in the morning as usual but this time before the sun came up. Needed a headlamp for the first couple of miles. Even got to see three pair of eyes looking at me in the dark and was kind of eerie not knowing what was looking back at you. By the time that I arrived at the lake it was light enough to see everything. I continued up the trail to Twin Lake and think that I saw the same three deer that were blinking at me earlier.
24,2018-08-24,[''],Nice hike. The lake is not as beautiful as the Brighton lakes but it's not as crowded either. The flowers have mostly all faded; the trees and greenery are pretty. We saw two Stellar Jays and lots of Chipmucks. The smoke from the fires reaches into the canyon but it's not as thick as in the valley.
25,2018-08-18,['hiking'],Took our 2 year old on this hike and he made it about a quarter to a third of the way on his own before he got tired. Although that may have been because it was getting late. It was about 7 pm when we started the hike. Either way it was a great hike. Very fun and quick even with a two year old.
26,2018-08-14,['hiking'],So beautiful along the whole trail. Amazing flowers and plenty of shade. Easy for small kids.
27,2018-07-30,['hiking'],Great trail! Slightly rocky in some areas. Great for all ages.
28,2018-07-28,[''],"Beautiful trail with very little traffic, even on a Saturday!"
29,2018-07-27,['hiking'],"Perfect hike for kids. I do this one in the evening on week nights and I’m usually one of the only ones up there. All trails isn’t very accurate on the map, just make sure to follow the markers. Bring bug spray"
30,2018-07-26,[''],"great, easy hike. We accidentally went during the wildflower festival or whatever it's called, so the trail was very busy.... the flowers were beautiful, and the lake was pretty (and small). we saw some deer, pika, and lots of birds including a red-necked sapsuckers, stellar jays, and Lincoln sparrow. We started at Silver lake, and that was a beautiful spot too. :) great trail for kids!!"
31,2018-07-08,[''],Beautiful flowers and a decent amount of shade. The lake was meh.
32,2018-07-08,[''],Does anyone know if you can camp up here?
33,2018-07-01,[''],Great easy hike. Saw a moose on the way up and while sitting on a rock by the lake saw some tiger salamanders and caddisfly larvae stuck to the rocks underwater. Lots of wildflowers right now.
34,2018-06-29,[''],"Great easy trail with our kids (7 &4). Lots of bugs up there right now, but the wild flowers are out and are glorious. We saw a moose on our way down in the evening."
35,2018-06-25,['hiking'],"Great little hike, gorgeous views, and good for kids (we have 2 three year olds). We went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn’t crowded at all. Would definitely go again."
36,2018-06-24,[''],Easy and beautiful trail. Kids down to five had no trouble but got pretty tired.
37,2018-06-24,[''],"Great hike, especially for me as a 74 year old. No moose but a deer on the hill by the lake. Only one small patch of snow. Trail not well marked in places, but people returning in the trail kept us on course. Lots of young children on the trail so that gave me confidence."
38,2018-06-18,[''],"Saw a moose around the lake, plenty of chipmunks, prairie dogs. Nice trail easy and well marked ."
39,2018-06-16,[''],Love this hike. Quick and fairly easy. Lake at the end is pretty and usually run into either moose or deer in the evening.
40,2018-06-15,[''],Beautiful hike shaded by Aspen trees. I hiked in the evening and the weather was perfect.
41,2018-06-09,['hiking'],"This is an OK hike.  we made the loop going up to Lake Solitude and continuing to Twin Lakes and back down to Silver Lake. 
There's no more snow on the trail. The views from Twin Lake up the cirque is beautiful.  Busy trail,  even during the week."
42,2018-06-02,['hiking'],"Was easier than expected. Not steep at all. There wasn’t much snow at all up there we did just fine in regular hiking shoes. We love hiking and wasn’t really satisfied with how short it was so we followed the summit road up further and got a beautiful view of the lake. Got a little nervous with the cave up there and saw a pile of animal fur so we didn’t go any further. 

But this is an easy one for children! Very beautiful."
43,2018-05-22,['hiking'],"Still lots of snow on the trail, making it hard to follow.  The lake is still pretty frozen. I imagine this hike will be a lot more fun and much prettier in a couple more weeks."
44,2017-10-30,['hiking'],"We did this hike yesterday, fairly easy, saw a lot of families. Some good views and elevation climb is not difficult.  This was a good hike for someone like me who is new to the area and getting acclimated to the elevation. Caution: you should bring GPS since trail not well marked and it's easy to get off which we did one time (several others we passed would ask us if still on trail).  Also, while probably obvious, this late in fall we did encounter areas of ice/snow so while easy hike, bring appropriate footwear."
45,2017-10-14,['hiking'],"What a beautiful afternoon for a fall hike!  There won't be many more afternoons like this one at such a high elevation.  The trail was covered in golden aspen leaves and the weather was crisp and sunny.  The only trouble was the work they've recently done on the service road and in felling trees erased the path.  We found it again luckily.  And thank heaven for the GPS!  We somehow started heading down to a lackluster pond before realizing it wasn't Lake Solitude and we were supposed to be heading up toward the lake instead.  In other words, the trail wasn't well marked.  But the kids (15, 11, 9, and 7) and I had a great time and enjoyed this hike.  We saw so many deer!"
46,2017-09-25,['hiking'],Easy hike. Was pretty with the snowfall over the weekend. Nice for a quick day hike.
47,2017-09-25,[''],good easy hike
48,2017-09-22,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, fairly easy (if used to the altitude)."
49,2017-09-17,[''],Trail was well marked and not difficult or maybe we are just getting acclimated. Beautiful aspen groves that will be gorgeous in about two weeks. Some are just starting to turn gold. There were moose close to Silver Lake and fortunately there was someone there to guide us away as the bull was a little aggressive due to the approaching mating season. Got a glimpse of them but not good enough to photo.
50,2017-09-05,[''],"Saw a moose near Silver Lake! And the best part was, people were keeping a respectful distance and not harassing it."
51,2017-09-03,[''],We saw 4 moose at the start. Beautiful trail and easy too!
52,2017-09-03,['hiking'],Super easy hike up to Lake Solitude. We chose to continue to hike over to Twin Lakes. Would probably do Twin Lakes to Lake Solitude next time.
53,2017-09-02,['hiking'],"The aspens at the beginning of this hike are so amazing! The rest of the hike is nice, but not all that exciting. The lake was a little lackluster to be honest. Still nice, but I don't think I would do this one again. There are others I like more. I gave this 4 stars because the trail is well maintained and there are signs everywhere, so you cannot get lost."
54,2017-08-31,[''],Nice circular hike to the lakes on the Brighton - Solitude border.  Parked at Sliver Lake where we first walked the boardwalk and saw a moose! Then up the trail from there.
55,2017-08-12,[''],Great hike. Really enjoyed going up over Lake Solitude and down into Twin Lakes. Beautiful wildflowers and the views were amazing.
56,2017-07-24,['hiking'],Went on a dope hike to a lake yo!
57,2017-07-18,[''],"came down to solitude from twin lakes. I expected this lake to be prettier but it was not quite as nice as the others. All downhill, easy trip back down if you're up at Twin."
58,2017-07-06,[''],"Fun, quick hike. Up and down in some parts but a lot of the trail is covered in shade."
59,2017-07-06,['hiking'],"This was a great hike. The trail was marked well and perfectly sloped for children: not flat but not too steep. Our 4 year old was able to hike there and back without much complaining. The trail was well shaded with pretty scenery. I only wish the lake had easier access for the kids to play in or throw rocks. No big deal for me, but the kids were a little sad."
60,2017-07-02,[''],"Love this hike! It's a good distance, but easy enough for beginner hikers and kids. Only trouble is that it can be a little difficult to stay on the right trail (but as of July 2017, lots more markers to help you figure it out)."
61,2017-06-29,['hiking'],Trail still has a little bit of run-off but is mostly dry. It was so beautiful!
62,2017-06-22,['hiking'],"We did this along with the Twin Lakes Trail, which made for a good full morning of hiking. This one was pretty easy but really enjoyable. Definitely plan on doing this one again in the future."
63,2017-06-22,['hiking'],this is the first i have hiked this trail this season.  It is one of my favorites for wildlife encounters.  There are a few patches of snow on the trail and a massive fallen tree across the new trail.
64,2017-06-21,['hiking'],"Great hiking...but just follow the marked trails! We tried to follow using the AllTrails app gps, and getting t totally lost. Added about 0.5 miles straight uphill. Nevertheless, it was a spectacular hike: the lake was serene, and we saw a deer and moose!"
65,2017-06-19,['hiking'],Very easy and family friendly hike. There were a few patches of snow on the trail and a little tricky to cross but overall not too bad.
66,2017-06-18,['hiking'],The trail gets a little confusing when it crosses paths with another trail. Just follow the pink flags and you'll get to the lake.
67,2017-06-10,[''],Great hike - still snowy but we made it to the lake.  Even saw a porcupine!  And a few deer.  Good for kids.
68,2017-06-09,[''],"Beautiful day but still a lot of snow on the trail. As a result we lost the trail several times (not marked at all after trailhead) and ultimately turned back without reaching the lake. I'll definitely try again, I've hiked it before and it's a relatively easy hike with great potential for moose sightings."
69,2017-06-04,['hiking'],Lost trail due to heavy snow in spots. Will try again later this year.
70,2017-02-01,['hiking'],This hike is actually very  cozy and peaceful with its tall grasses and white pines. i felt right at home on this trail. and although the lake might be small it is still ideal for moose! this hike was the first time that i have ever seen a moose :D i was very exited and thrilled to sit and watch this moose drink and play in the lake. we also saw a dear as well as the normal squares and chipmunks. ​
71,2016-09-21,[''],This is a very easy hike. The trail is pretty much flat the whole way. The last tiny bit is steep but once you get to the top of that you'll see the lake. It's a pretty small lake but it's beautiful. Be careful if you go through the brush to the shore. When I was there there were two large moose laying on the shore.
72,2016-09-10,[''],"I did this hike in August around 5:30pm. It is such a gorgeous and peaceful hike!! Once we got to the lake, we had wine & a sandwich as we watched the sun set all the way behind the mountains. By that time, the trail was completely empty, which was nice. I'll do this hike over and over again. Very easy, but still a good work out."
73,2016-08-28,['hiking'],"Nice hike! Not too many people around and it was pretty peaceful. Aside from the ski lifts and a few other man-made things, it's a beautiful hike."
74,2016-08-25,['hiking'],"Great hike up, didn't k ow what to expect but the lake was smaller than I thought but had fun on the trail."
75,2016-08-18,['bird watching'],"Started our Bird Watching Tour here before going over Guardsman Pass, saw several different types of Birds, along with Moose, and a Snowshoe Rabbit, made for an amazing Tuesday evening"
76,2016-08-11,['hiking'],Nice hike. Go early.
77,2016-08-10,['hiking'],GREAT family hike.. Steep and rocky at the very end of the trail.. We would definitely recommend it.
78,2016-08-01,['hiking'],"It was pretty easy, good for families. A little steep at the very end but a good afternoon hike. Great view."
79,2016-07-30,['hiking'],When silver lake just wasn't enough I took 4 kids up to lake solitude. They loved the friendly chipmunks. Nice hike.
80,2016-07-30,[''],Nice and cool
81,2016-07-23,[''],"Beautiful area. The app stated camping is available on this trail, but we got there but no overnight parking anywhere. All other camp sites nearby and accesible with young kids were full. UGH"
82,2016-07-10,['hiking'],Beautiful trail! We love doing the Twin Lakes loop with this one.
83,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail.  We did the Lake Solitude / Twin Lake Loop.  The Lake Solitude portion of the trail was not very crowded.  The Twin Lake had a lot more people on it.  I'm glad we did the Solitude Lake portion first.  Solitude Lake to Twin Lake is very steep, but the trail is a maintenance road so other than the incline it is easy to walk."
84,2016-07-03,[''],Awesome hike for kids!! Loved this hike.
85,2016-07-03,[''],I loved this hike because there was shade and it was the perfect length for my first hike of the season.  We also saw two moose on the way up.
86,2016-07-02,[''],Fun for me and for the kids
87,2016-06-29,['hiking'],"Great, short hike. There was a mamma moose and her babies by the lake:)"
88,2016-06-28,['hiking'],"This was a fun trail for our inexperienced as well as our experienced hikers.  It was fairly easy.  We saw a few other hikers, but it wasn't crowded.  There was plenty of shady and sunny spots along the way.  We had a great time."
89,2016-06-25,['mountain biking'],"First of all, there is no biking on the boardwalk to get up to the trail, so whatever. Once you get on the trail, there is like no way to stay on your bike what so ever... Don't even try it, it's not worth it, so I guess it was a good little hike with a few pedals here and there. Also way to many hikers to do any biking, don't even know why this was under the mountain biking section"
90,2016-06-23,[''],"Fun hike to the lake. Highly recommend taking the trail instead of the tram. Many beautiful pictures. When you get close to the tram, it starts to get very steep, but other than that, for the most part it's flat and a pretty easy hike. The lake is only about 800m. away from the tram. It is not great, but still great to make it too if you feel up to extending the hike. All together, it took us about an hour and a half. Definently worth a try!"
91,2016-06-20,[''],"If you start from the bottom it makes a great long hike. There is not a lot of shade. Did it with some runner friends, and there were some hills that were pretty steep. We rode the ski lift down which was very nice to have."
92,2016-06-19,[''],Great hike for a family with young kids.
93,2016-06-16,['hiking'],"Fairly easy, the hill at the start and just before the lake can wind you a little, but otherwise it's pretty flat.  Scenery is nice, though it's a little marred by the access roads for the ski equipment."
94,2016-06-15,[''],"easy hike, beautiful scenery."
95,2015-10-12,['hiking'],"I wandered over here from Silver Lake Loop and there were a lot of people but it was a holiday weekend. However, the views were great and the fall colors were gorgeous!"
96,2015-09-26,['hiking'],"This lake lives up to its name. I've done it three times now and have never seen another human at the lake. Saw 5 deer this time and decided not to disturb them so didn't stay long. Nice, easy, short hike. Extremely beautiful in the autumn. There was still construction going on in the Solitude area but not near the lake. Trail is still closed beyond the lake so the loop to Twin Lakes isn't possible. Still very worth the short trip."
97,2015-09-20,[''],"Beautiful trail!  The mountains and wild flowers were gorgeous. The hardest part is the steep hill right before you get to the lake, but the steep part is short. Solitude is not an accurate description because it was super crowded...I would recommend going during the middle of the week and not a weekend or holiday if you want to avoid lots of people!"
98,2015-09-03,['hiking'],"The trail map is inaccurate. The trail head is in Solitude Mountain resort and the easier 1.5 mile out and back hike begins from the top of a chairlift ( costs money to ride). The short hike is very easy for experienced hikers. For others it is not bad but note there is a bit of a climb just before the lake that left some less experienced or those not accustomed to the altitude a little winded. However the lake is beautiful and peaceful! The trail is well marked from the lift ( 1.5 miles out and back seem accurate).
IF you are hiking from the base of Solitude Mountain resort the trail is steep and not well marked ( it took us a couple of turns to realized the blue metal sticks are trail markers for hiking and disc golf; still  confusing). We took a few wrong foot trail turns confusing the disc golf trail course with the Solitude Lake trails. It was an adventure and beautiful. There was a disc golf tournament going on during our hike which we were trying to avoid getting in the way. Given our errors during the ascent and descent, the out and back is roughly 7 miles (?). Despite the challenges no regrets beginning the hike from the base though Solitude could do a better job of marking tails.
There appears to be some confusion: Silver Lake is near Brighton Resort with a boardwalk. The Silver Lake train crosses the Solitude Lake Trail if you are hiking from the base. If you take the chair lift, you have to descend from the lift exit and descend to the Silver Lake trail."
99,2015-08-24,[''],Great hike. Very easy and pleasant. Perfect for beginners and kids. The lake is beautiful and very calming.
100,2015-08-18,[''],It was a great hike for someone who isn't a regular hiker. It is a much cooler option when it's hot down in the valley. The lake is beautiful and serene.
101,2015-08-17,['hiking'],"This is a great hike for beginners. I took my sister and nephew, who do not hike often, on this trail and they loved it. We went on a Sunday morning and only crossed paths with a few people. Ski slope construction is going on just past the lake right now so hiking past the lake is not allowed. The construction equipment was loud and did not allow for a relaxing morning at the lake as we had hoped."
102,2015-07-27,['fishing'],"Beautiful scenery! Tons of wild flowers and smelled just like pine trees. There's areas to have picnics, and benches to see the lake. The actual lake was low but like any other area due to the drought! The trail is very easy to follow and well marked!"
103,2015-07-04,[''],"Lovely, relativity easy trail. Mostly shaded the entire way. Very steep right before the lake. It's actually 3 miles RT, just FYI."
104,2015-07-03,[''],Great hike easy fun and would do it again.
105,2015-06-28,['hiking'],"Very nice short hike and a great way to escape the 100 degree day in SLC, at this elevation it was under 80 and threatened rain, was really a nice hike if short, but good for casual hikers looking to be a little challenged. I only hiked to Lake Solitude, normally there's a loop to hike but....

Ditto on the construction closure to Twin Lakes reservoir or pass, and I went on Saturday. The flat part of the trail around Silver Lake is very congested and on boardwalk, once you get around the lake a nice mile long virtually all uphill hike to Lake Solitude. The last 150 feet is pretty steep and would not be fun in the rain :) Then you pop up on the lake and it's really pretty. If there was active construction going on I could see how this would not be so enjoyable. BTW there is tree cover most of the way past the first lake. Once you are done plan to drive back over the pass heading east to Park City if it's open, then you can head back to SLC or Provo."
106,2015-06-27,['hiking'],"Nice easy hike through aspen and pines. However, they are doing some heavy construction on the ski lifts near the lake so it was not peaceful at all. Loud construction for about half the hike. Construction also closed off the trail that continues past the lake so I couldn't do the loop to twin lakes like I was planning."
107,2015-06-26,[''],To crowded. Nice hike easy with only one steep spot the last 50 yards to the top. Good hike for kids but not a place to get away
108,2015-06-01,[''],Great hike today. There are patches of snow but it was gorgeous!
109,2014-11-19,['hiking'],"My three boys (2 four year olds and a 9 month old in a pack) and I went on this hike the end of September 2014.  The leaves were gorgeous. The trail is well shaded and we did hit a tiny amount of snow. As another reviewer said it is steep at the end, but only for a little bit. We took a lunch and ate by the lake. A good hike for any levels."
110,2014-09-22,['hiking'],Pretty fall day and quiet and peaceful. Beautiful country.
111,2014-09-01,['hiking'],"Easy hike, well shaded, and good for all skill levels. Like many lake hikes on the Wasatch, a bit steep right at the end, but there are plenty of rocks and tree roots to help you keep your footing. We went on Labor Day Weekend and got very lucky that the trail was not busy on our way up, but we passed several large groups on the way down. If you want to have this trail to yourself, best to go on a weekday or early in the morning."
112,2014-08-03,['hiking'],Fun hike up to a nice lake at Solitude ski resort
113,2014-07-26,['hiking'],A very enjoyable hike. Right before the end there is a super steep hill. do not turn around there once up the hill you are at the lake! Saw lots of paintbrush around the trail in many shades of orange and pink!
114,2014-07-13,[''],"If you can do this hike soon the wildflowers are absolutely AMAZING!!!!  Great hike to take everyone in the family on.  Only one section right as you are approaching the lake that is moderately steep terrain, the remainder of the trail is well marked and easy enough to enjoy the scenery.  We did encounter a couple of moose as we first entered the trail (a cow and calf - we heard the bull was around, but never saw him).  Overall a great hike, will do this one again!"
115,2014-07-05,['hiking'],"The trail was great, but the people were in masses because of the holiday. It was a good distance for 3 and 5 year olds and I'm also 20 weeks pregnant. We loved all the wild flowers and the aspen trees along the way. The lake itself wasn't really a gorgeous destination but it did allow for a stopping point for lunch."
116,2014-06-02,[''],"This is one of my favorite easy hikes. You start by walking around Silver Lake, then heading south-west at the beginning of the Lake Solitude trail. The trail is mostly quiet with not too many people, but enough that I feel comfortable hiking by myself. The trail is pretty with lots of trees and wildflowers and I often see animals, including deer and moose. It's quite and serene. The last little but before getting to the lake is steep and that's when you know you're there. Super quick hike and peaceful."
117,2013-12-01,['hiking'],Pretty hike to the lake. Not too difficult. Moose and deer tracks all over. It poured rain on us.
118,2013-11-19,['hiking'],Awesome little hike. Took 2 little girls who did great pretty easy hike. Beautiful scenery. The mountains trees and untouched snow. We were the only ones out there from about 9-10:30. Went around the lake a few times :) for sure Gina have to go when there's no snow !
119,2013-09-22,['hiking'],This would be a good trail for beginning hikers - it is short and there is very little elevation gain.  The trail is mostly shaded and has some decent scenery along the way.  I hiked this trail in the early evening and saw some deer on my way back from the lake.
120,2013-08-09,['hiking'],"Another easy after-work trail. Enjoyable in the cool afternoons of fall with beautiful colors on the aspen groves. The lake isn't much, and there isn't a view, but it's a great workout. "
121,2013-07-10,['hiking'],"We made a large loop out of it to Twin Lakes and Silver Lake. It came out to 4.53 miles and took us less than two hours. Out of the three lakes, Twin Lakes was by far the nicest. The trail seemed easier than the one we did two days ago to Lake Mary and Lake Catherine.  We didn't see any mountain bikers or any wildlife in the area."
122,2012-09-03,['mountain biking'],"Made the huge mistake of coming on Labor Day. This makes for a horrible day to hike but especially to bike! Probably not worth biking on any other day, rocky and just not very fun."
123,2011-08-05,['hiking'],"The hike was very fun, the lake was not extremely spectacular, but a great place for lunch. This summer hike made me want to go skiing!"
124,2011-07-14,['hiking'],Fun easy trail across Solitude ski resort to the lake. I saw almost as many deer as disc golfers. I have heard this trail gets a lot of use from mountain bikers but I didn't run into any. Supposedly you can make this a loop hike by continuing on to Twin Lakes reservoir but I did not attempt it. There was still lots of snow on the trail as of 8 July.
