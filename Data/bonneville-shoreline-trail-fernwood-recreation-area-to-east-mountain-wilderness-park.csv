1,2019-08-08,['mountain biking'],High traffic trail so keep your eyes and ears open for all varieties of users.  Beautiful views and a lot of hidden gem spots. 
2,2019-07-29,['hiking'],I was pleasently suprised. The trail is pretty easy; some ups but nothing to difficult. Great view. Perfect for an evening stroll
3,2019-07-16,['hiking'],Perfect trail for trail running. Especially for a beginner trail runner. 
4,2019-06-29,['hiking'],Great trail with really nice views! Took my 3 dogs and they loved it. I like how it’s a mixture of shaded and non shaded areas. Also lots of pretty streams and creeks! 
5,2019-06-23,[''],"One of my favorites that we hit up regularly, great for kids and dogs."
6,2019-06-12,"['trail running', 'washed out']",beautiful. mostly flat with sort uphill sections. good for trail running. some shade. 
7,2019-05-13,"['hiking', 'no shade']",
8,2019-04-27,['mountain biking'],"Excellent section of shoreline. Great for all abilities, hiking, running, mountain biking."
9,2018-10-28,[''],"We just moved here, and we we looking for a nice trail near my home.  This trail is perfect, dosent hurt its fall and the colors are spectacular! My dogs loved it too!"
10,2018-09-04,['hiking'],This trail is really close to home so I use it a lot. It's great! You get a good leg workout on the steep parts and then a little bit of leisure when it evens out. I love it!
11,2018-08-06,['trail running'],I love this trail for a good run! Beautiful views along the mountainside. I couldn’t see a whole lot due to the fires. But this would be a perfect trail when it is clear and when the sun is setting.
12,2018-05-06,['mountain biking'],Great local trail but also a favorite for hikers so early morning is the best time to avoid the crowds
13,2017-11-13,['hiking'],Great trail!! Beautiful views for miles!! ❤️
14,2017-07-31,['walking'],Not a bad little hike to take the kiddos on. Very easy and linear. I rated a two because what I look for in a hike is an escape from the city and you can still here the cars and hear the noises of people's back yards. Very clean and well maintained though. Great for a quick trail run just to stay in shape.
15,2017-07-27,[''],Excellent trail run today!
16,2017-07-15,[''],Beautiful!
17,2017-07-08,[''],"Hot, dry, dusty, rattle snake!"

19,2017-04-30,[''],Easily marked. Go as far as you want. Beautiful views and trails.
20,2017-03-14,['hiking'],"Trail isn't marked very well. Nice hike for March. A little ice here and there, but not to worry. Current conditions:   https://youtu.be/b7upSFl9L2M"
21,2016-09-16,[''],"Reasonably technical in several spots.  Bridges over most streams.  Not too busy for a Friday.  Horses, hikers, mountain bikes.  All friendly.  Watch out for poop though.  Great 10 mile ride. 2.5 hours on pedelec."
22,2016-08-28,[''],Great
23,2016-08-18,['trail running'],Excellent early morning run. Make sure to take a few of the off shoot trails up the draws. They the climbing is fun and the vistas are worth it!
24,2016-08-17,['hiking'],Very family friendly. Very flat. The north side is much more shaded.
25,2016-08-06,['mountain biking'],Great mountain biking trail! We picked up the trail at Tunnel Springs Park.
26,2016-08-03,[''],Great hiking trail
27,2016-06-30,['hiking'],This hike is perfect for beginners and dog friendly. Love it.
28,2016-06-12,[''],I love it
29,2016-06-08,['hiking'],"Nice trail, beautiful view! Able to take my dog, which always makes me happy!"
30,2016-05-31,['hiking'],"We started at trailhead by newer home development. Beginning of trail is uphill and lush, opens up to creek that you cross and then trail is wide like dirt road that leads south. Pretty flat and super easy, but the view and vegetation makes it a great strolling hike. An good trail to frequent daily."
31,2012-04-17,['trail running'],"I run this trail almost 2-3 times per week.  It is one of my choices for training..  Very good hill work, good distances for stretching out your pace..   I have run this year round with little issue at all..  some of the canyons (particularly Adams Canyon) can get ""icey"" in the winter, but Yaktraks or Kahtola's solve the issue.   This is one of my favorite trails.."
32,2011-12-30,['mountain biking'],"Great ride to stay in shape, doesn't take long."
33,2011-10-02,['mountain biking'],"Great trail. Very close. Best to ride in the spring and early summer. Later in the year it becomes very sandy and rutted out. North to south is the easiest from Fernwood to the shooting range. Trail is fully exposed to the sun most of the day and is fairly busy. Watch out for people, bikes and horses on the downhills and the blind corners. Fun workout, not to technical and a good verity of challenging uphill climbs, fast flats, turns and down hill."
34,2011-07-06,['mountain biking'],I HATE THIS TRAIl ITS ALL FREAKING UPHILL!!!
