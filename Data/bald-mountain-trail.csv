"
1,2019-09-04,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",Short and sweet trail with breathtaking views that are 110% worth the climb! Would highly recommend!
2,2019-09-03,['hiking'],Great hike near mirror lake. Is a fast incline with many false summits. View is worth it. 
3,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"This is a fairly rocky trail and is exposed for the full length (bring/use sunscreen). I recommend good hiking boots, though I saw many people wearing Teva-type sandals. The wind can get brisk and cool, so plan accordingly. You'll likely need to stop now and then to catch your breath as it is high elevation (11-12K feet asl). The views all the way up and down are quite stunning and worth the effort. "
4,2019-09-02,['hiking'],Awesome hike went early before it got too hot. And it was definitely worth it!! The view from the top was priceless my 7 year old loved it!
5,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']","Great training/see where you are-type of trail. In my humble opinion the hardest part of the trail is the first 1/4 mile... pretty steep, but after that the climb to the summit turns into a nice rhythmic dance of left-right. The views are amazing, can get windy and a bit chilly at times. The final climb to the summit is not for the faint of heart as you are exposed at nearly 12k above sea level, but the end is totally worth getting over the fear. Love Utah."
6,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']","Super fun trail to hike. Very busy on Labor Day weekend. The very top is not ideal for small dogs, some big rock climbs. Very sunny, not overly hot but still wear sunscreen at this elevation. Clear path to follow. Looking forward to trying it again without the dog to try and make better time. "
7,2019-08-21,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",This trail is a decent challenge and a lot of fun! Push to the very top!! It’s worth it. The views are phenomenal. We saw a few chipmunks and 2 mountain goats at the top who hung out with us while we picnicked overlooking the panoramic view of the Uintas.  
8,2019-08-21,"['hiking', 'no shade']","Wow what an amazing hike. Climb some sandstone footholds to the top of Bald Mountain for spectacular views of the surrounding area (lakes, mountains, valleys, and trees). The 1.4 mile hike up took about an hour for me and my father. We were a little slower than our usual pace because of the high altitude (10,700ft at the peak), so we took our time and drank lots of water. At 9am we were the first folks on the trail. First hike in Utah and it did not disappoint! "
9,2019-08-19,['hiking'],"Took a quick hike up here this morning.  Temperature was perfect, trail was crowded."
10,2019-08-18,['hiking'],steep trail at first. Many false summits. great views.
11,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"A surprisingly quick hike to a great view. We didn't see any mountain goats, but they are often seen around here."
12,2019-08-17,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
13,2019-08-15,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
14,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'scramble']","This is such a great hike! While it is short, it is pretty hard-ish. There are a lot of places one could fall and tumble quite a ways. We went on 8/11/19 and the conditions were pleasant until about halfway up and then it became incredibly windy! The wind was chilly and I needed my windbreaker, especially to cover my ears. The views are incredible and the hike is pretty short. It was a little harder on the joints getting back down, but we loved it!"
15,2019-08-07,['hiking'],"I usually like longer hikes, and ones I can trail run back down but this one was great today with the kids (5 of them ages 4-16). Lots of mountain goats in the upper meadow and nothing beats the views of the lakes from the top. "
16,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"Great hike. Definitely hard to breathe. Steep for a little while, but totally worth it for the views the entire way up!"
17,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"Awesome, relatively short hike to an almost 12,000 ft. peak and an amazing view. I lost count of how many lakes I could see from the top.   Steep,  rocky switchbacks to start.  The middle third of the hike flattens out for a while,  then a short steep section to the top.   Took 50 minutes up at a slow,  steady pace.   About 40 minutes down.   Be prepared for the altitude.   It's no joke up there. Do this hike in the morning and stroll around a few of the hundreds of lakes later in the day for a great day in the high Uintas."
18,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'no shade']",
19,2019-08-02,['hiking'],Beautiful hike.  Took little over 2 hrs with rest at top
20,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",
21,2019-08-02,['hiking'],"My wife and I did this hike yesterday - 8-2-19...while it's mostly a rocky trail, the views of the dozens of high altitude lakes surrounding the area, the variety of wild flowers all over, and the 6 mountain goats we saw up close - made it all worth while...awesome!"
22,2019-07-29,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Amazing views.
23,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'snow']","this trail was awesome! the whole thing is very rocky with a constant incline but totally worth it and doable. I even had a nice lunch at the top! it was great pretty much no bugs, no shade, and very rocky so be prepared with sunscreen and some good hiking boots! little snow on the path but very easy to go over"
24,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'snow']","Good trail. Got too cold for us so we didn’t make it to the top. Take a jacket, especially if it’s overcast"
25,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'snow']",
26,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"If you’re not used to high elevations, this may be a little more difficult for you. It was an awesome hike, and my dog loved it as well. Bring some sunscreen! "
27,2019-07-20,['hiking'],Great Hike. We did it on 7/18/19. Snow was gone except one spot just before you hit the ridge and turn back toward the peak. There is a trail around it to the left so no big deal. 
28,2019-07-20,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'snow']","Great trail, not too strenuous, and great views! Just did this trail on 7/19/19 and there were still two patches of snow we had to go around, but it didn’t add any to the overall length and it was all navigable. The trail is pretty rocky towards the top. Overall it was a great hike, took us 3hrs round trip with a lot of stops and taking a lot of photos. "
29,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"Most of the snow has now cleared, follow the kearns to avoid the snow on the first ridge there. 

Forgot to start the tracking for the first .5 miles, so tracking is a little shorter."
30,2019-07-20,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
31,2019-07-17,['hiking'],60+. Be prepared to scramble over some rocks. There was a stretch where a snow patch blocked the trail and it was kind of sketchy working around it. 30 to 35 minutes into the hike I was above treeline and the terminus wasn’t in sight. Fabulous views of the Wasatch National Forest. 
32,2019-07-12,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'snow']","We've done this hike a few times, but we only went up about halfway today (7/12/19). Turned around at the snow (melting cornice). It would've been too sketchy to climb any farther with our puppy. With snow gear it would be short and a piece of cake, but without, one slip could easily turn into a fatal tumble (see the pic I shared). About 50 yards or so back down the trail, there appeared to be a good scramble route to bypass the snow (assuming you're ok with Class 2+ or easy 3 with a bit of exposure ... and you're careful not to dislodge rocks on others). After our short hike, we took the lower trail around the mountain, which passes many lakes. Backpackers said fish were biting with every cast. Made it back to the truck just as thunder began to rumble. Beautiful area."
33,2019-07-10,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",A moderate climb with some short steep sections. Largely exposed with very little shade and some narrow spots as you cut back at the halfway point on your way up or down. The view and area at the top are well worth it - you can see so many lakes in a 360-degree view of the forest. 
34,2019-07-03,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'snow']",Dfwh
35,2019-06-27,"['hiking', 'snow']","Don’t go for another month.  There was a ton of snow up to 2 feet high and it was soft, slippery, and in some areas you would just sink in.  Took 30 min just to go .3 miles"
36,2018-10-27,[''],Pretty mellow hike. Nothing too steep and there are so many beautiful places to stop and admire the wonderful scenery.
37,2018-10-11,['hiking'],"Really awesome trail and amazing views. My opinion, this is hard rated. Pretty much 1000 ft in a mile. They have horsetail falls rated hard on here that’s a mile longer and about 600 ft per mile. Especially since you start at like 10,500 ft, so you’re kinda winded from the get. Really cool though and the lower loops are awesome too."
38,2018-10-09,[''],"Short, sweet trail in great shape."
39,2018-09-23,[''],Easy and beautiful. Stairway to heaven I guess you could say.
40,2018-09-11,['hiking'],"Love love this hike - had to stop a couple times on the way up, but no regrets because the views are to die for. Agree with moderate difficulty, and take plenty of water because you are going to want to be up there for a while!"
41,2018-08-28,['hiking'],"Great views, well worn trail, exciting cliffs to look off the edges, and very accessible trail head from the highway. My family with younger kids was able to hike this with only a few hundred yards of piggyback with the youngest. The following year all of them did it again on their own. We love this hike."
42,2018-08-18,[''],favorite hike so far!!!
43,2018-08-15,['hiking'],Fun hike! Was fairly easy with a beautiful payoff at the end. So many lakes that can be seen!
44,2018-08-12,['hiking'],"A hard hike, quick elevation gain with many scrambles! But totally worth the challenge! Very rewarding and we saw goats!!"
45,2018-08-11,['hiking'],"Great trail with amazing views.  For the time and distance, the top is very worth it!"
46,2018-08-10,['hiking'],"I did this about 3 years ago and there was some snow on the alpine section. This time, of course, no snow, so I was able to see more of what the landscape looks like. I had hoped to escape the smoke, but even the high Uintahs had smoke. A great, short, easy hike with some precarious-looking edges for those of us who are afraid of heights. Too many stupid-looking cairns at the top."
47,2018-08-10,['hiking'],This was my first hike to the summit of a mountain and I agree it is good for a beginner! I would not consider it hard or difficult. Definitely moderate. I only had to pause briefly closer to the top because of the oxygen level I suppose. Some parts were a little steep but much of it was very easy to walk. Hiking sticks are a huge help. Beautiful views at the top!
48,2018-08-07,['hiking'],"Great hike with the most stunning views we’ve seen yet. We took our 4, 8, and 10 yr old kids and they did great. Our little guy walked the whole way - loved climbing the rocks. The heights were a little scary toward the top, but well worth the views. Our gps said it was a little over 2 miles to the top and the round trip took us about 3 hours, but we were taking our time with the kids. Highly recommend."
49,2018-08-07,['hiking'],"Personally much harder and steeper than I expected for a trail that AllTrails rates as “moderate”. That said, the views from the summit were amazing!  Hiking sticks are highly recommended, especially for the way down."
50,2018-08-04,[''],Good hike great views.
51,2018-07-31,['hiking'],"One of the best hikes in Uinta mounatins! It could be a bit steep but manageable. To anyone who says it’s a really difficult hike, then maybe you should reconsider since a 3yo and 55yo was able to make it or you’ll miss the amazing views up there."
52,2018-07-29,[''],"Everyone says this is 1.3 to the top but the whole trip was logged in my gps as 5.2 and it definitely took WAY longer than we thought it would to actually summit. We also went slow since we had 2 dogs with us, one of which was smaller, but either we did something wrong or this isn't accurate. Or maybe they only count it as making it to the first piece before the rock scrambling starts. To actually summit, i believe this to be much longer, so just wanted to post this in case it helps others. We never would have brought our little dog if we had known how long it was. But all that being said, the views are beautiful from the top."
53,2018-07-26,[''],Short but steep hike to the top of bald mtn. The views from the top are incredible as you can see 20+ lakes.
54,2018-07-25,[''],"Fun, steep trail with spectacular views and rocks! I think we counted 26 lakes/ponds that were visible from the top."
55,2018-07-25,[''],"The whole thing is rocky with boulders talus and gravel. Took the dog, her paws did fine but this wasn’t her first hike this month. I put her on the leash most of the way because I was fearful of the cliff edges and her accidentally wondering/falling off. Took us 2 hours with multiple breather breaks and a 20 minute stop up top. Totally would do this hike again, and I rarely say that since there are so many hikes and so little time."
56,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"One of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. Make it to the top, you won't regret it!"
57,2018-07-22,['hiking'],hard 1.4 miles one way but so worth it. Views are priceless.
58,2018-07-19,['hiking'],Good quick artery cleanser with amazing views ! I’ve hiked it multiple times and love it every time ! ☮️❤️⛰
59,2018-07-16,['hiking'],Steep hike with amazing view
60,2018-07-15,[''],excellent
61,2018-07-14,['hiking'],"The views up here were tremendous! Nice, short length for taking kids with you. I hiked it with my 6 year-old and she easily kept pace the entire way and didn't request any extra breaks. Must-do, beautiful views!"
62,2018-07-07,[''],Love loved this trail...butt kicking climb straight up and amazing views off all sides at the top! Can’t wait to go back ❤️
63,2018-07-03,['hiking'],"The trail was in great condition, and there were more than 10 species of wildflowers in bloom. The view along the majority of the trail was pretty nice, although there are a lot of dead trees mixed in with the live ones, which I thought detracted a little bit. You can see some pretty lakes below as well."
64,2018-07-03,[''],"Amazing hike today. Winds had to be 35 mph +, but virtually zero wind at the top. 360 degree incredible views."
65,2018-07-03,[''],Amazing views when you reach the top. mountain goats were also there. it's steep and up hill all the way.  like walking up over 95 flights of stairs. sunny and windy. no snow was there and all the trail is visible. it's hard to take in all the views. Worth every step.
66,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"I do this once every year. It's surprisingly short, considering the ruggedness of the terrain and the spectacular views at the top. This early in the year there are usually some patches of snow that impact the trail in inconveniently treacherous places, but not this year. Note of caution - this will be a hard hike for anyone not acclimated to the altitude, as you are starting at 10,000 ft."
67,2018-06-30,[''],Beautiful 360 degree views of the high Uinta mountains. Only thing is I couldn’t find the USGS badge marker at the summit? Has anyone else found it?
68,2018-06-25,['hiking'],"Hiked this in late June and encountered no snow. Fantastic first peak to bag for the inexperienced hiker. The only difficulty on this trail came from the narrow switchbacks on the eastern side, and some scrambling that needed to be done close to the summit. Bring sunscreen."
69,2018-06-21,[''],"Fun hike, didn’t get very far with my six year old in tow, but we had fun and enjoyed the great views. The trail is exposed to the sun."
70,2018-06-19,[''],"The summit is more like 2 miles each way. Great 360 degree panoramic view of the Uinta range, definitely worth the climb."
71,2018-06-11,[''],"I went yesterday (6-9-18), some snow in places can obscure the trail, elevation is a bit tough, but an amazing hike with peerless views of several lakes"
72,2017-11-06,['hiking'],"I loved all the lakes I got to see while doing this hike. So beautiful! I hiked this 10.29.17 and while there was some snow, it was still completely doable. We were up to the peak in 50 minutes and enjoyed the views from the peak."
73,2017-10-22,[''],Amazing views! Way more snow than expected!
74,2017-10-08,['hiking'],Lots of snow and super windy. Not a lot of other people. Dope views!!!!!
75,2017-09-26,[''],"Shortest hike for the views/summit! This was the first ""real"" hike I've done. This is where it all began : ). Saw a lot of children/dogs on this trail. A great experience for the family!"
76,2017-09-13,['hiking'],Went up for a nice Sunday hike. there's no shade/cover and it's fairly steep ascent so our smaller dog needed a little help coming down.  gorgeous views.
77,2017-09-11,['hiking'],"This is a great family trail for most abilities and endurance levels. The view from the top will not disappoint. As well, the trail is usually clear after July 4th, but there will still be snow on or near the trail. One thing to keep in mind is weather. Storms can roll in fast while on top of Bald so be cognizant of that. Fantastic family trail!"
78,2017-09-05,['hiking'],"This hike was so much fun. We made it up in a little under an hour. Spent an hour on top and got down in 45 minutes (I had to take a billion pictures.) You want to do this hike. No picture will do the view any justice. Be careful if you explore the peak (which is huge), the rocks shift around a lot in some areas and they are big enough that it would really suck if one fell on you. We also saw mountain goats!"
79,2017-09-03,['hiking'],Best views! Highly recommend :)
80,2017-09-03,['hiking'],Fun hike. A bit like climbing flights of stairs at times. Great views of the Uintas.
81,2017-08-30,['hiking'],Spectacular panoramic views!
82,2017-08-20,[''],One word of advice.. don't forget sunscreen!! Breath taking views! Took my 4 and 8 year old and dog!
83,2017-08-16,['hiking'],"This hike was absolutely amazing. It is a bit steep but definitely worth it. I did this in July and the trail did disappear in a small amount of snow for 10 yards...You're exploring a mountain, expect it to get rocky at times. Highly recommend it. The view is breathtaking. Bring a sweater."
84,2017-08-08,[''],"I can honestly say, besides Angel's Landing- this hike offers the prettiest views of any Utah hike I've done. You can see tons of lakes from the top and a panoramic view of the uintahs. The views going up were beautiful the whole way as well. Not a hard hike at all. The end is a little sketchy with tons of angular rocks jutting out and steep cliffs, so I put my dog on her leash at that point just to play it safe."
85,2017-08-06,['hiking'],Great Hike! even with whiny kids. Saw Mountain Goats and Raptors.
86,2017-08-05,[''],Phenomenal views.
87,2017-07-26,[''],breathtaking views. no shade so be sun safe.
88,2017-07-25,['hiking'],"The views ! ! ! ! Short, semi-steep, and worth every step."
89,2017-07-25,[''],Still some snow on the trail so that made it a little bit more difficult but definitely worth it for the amazing view at the top.
90,2017-07-21,[''],"beautiful short hike!  There is still a small snow area that you have to cross, shoes with good grip will help.  The views are amazing!  go early in the morning to avoid thunderstorms."
91,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"As always, this is a great, short (but demanding) hike through a beautiful landscape with a fantastic payoff in the views at the top.  As of 07/16/2017 there are still 2 places where snow across the trail necessitates a detour or very careful attention to your footing, as slipping would probably have significantly negative consequences. But it's not too challenging."
92,2017-07-10,['hiking'],"The views from the top are spectacular. There are lakes all around the bald mountain, the rocks are infinite and amazing, and the small flowering patches are very beautiful. This is an easy hike."
93,2017-07-10,['hiking'],"This hike is definitely one of our favorites! You loose your breathe a lot faster than normal since you're up around 10,000 feet altitude. Also we went around a week ago, and there's still a lot of snow so we didn't quite make it up to the top, but we definitely are going to come back in August to try it out again!"
94,2017-07-06,['hiking'],Great views!
95,2017-07-05,['hiking'],"A great hike, challenging at times. Snow pack still an issue in spots in early July but the view from the top was incredible. We saw a couple mountain goats on a ledge below us. It was quite a moment and the trail was virtually empty above the snowy areas."
96,2017-06-29,[''],Cool trail that gives you a good view of a lot of the lakes and ponds on the mirror lake highway. Can get pretty hot so bring lots of water!
97,2017-06-25,[''],"Do not go until later in the season end of June is too early. We managed to get to the summit today but the trail disappears into snow at the start, along the ridge line, and multiple times throughout the trail. If you have crampons or micro spikes and don't mind the adventure of going off the beaten trail and potentially scaling random 70 degree rock faces then go for it the views are amazing. The snow was beautiful in the distance though and you may see some Billy goats we even saw a baby goat nursing. It was fantastic!"
98,2016-11-14,['hiking'],"A far drive if you live in Salt Lake but a gorgeous one once you get into the Uintas. This was a rocky but pretty easy hike, what made it hard was the elevation. The view around all side are stunning.y dog was able to do it and I highly recommend this."
99,2016-09-22,['hiking'],"This is short enough that the elevation gain and altitude aren't a huge factor. Do you love the Uinta Mountains and are looking for some truly unique views? Look no further and get climbing! I normally use trekking poles but didn't the day I climbed this, and was not disappointed to have left them behind. Rocky, but just watch your step and keep moving, you'll be there in no time. Enjoyed the summit for 15-20 minutes solo before making a quick exit to beat an incoming rainstorm. Will be doing this one again, without a doubt."
100,2016-09-21,['hiking'],"Amazing view at the top. It's a relatively short hike, approximately 1 1/2 HR each way, but lots of rocks you need to maneuver over that gets your heart rate up. We ran into mountain goats which was really neat. There's a 30ft section that's a bit harry if your scared of heights. All n all a great hike. Bring a jacket."
101,2016-09-11,['hiking'],"Tons of fun. Plenty of wildlife -- saw deer and sheep right by the trailhead. Beautiful views all the way up and even more spectacular at the top. Mostly a moderate hike, though the altitude can make it pretty exhausting at times. Brought my small stubby-legged dog and he loved it. He only needed assistance for a couple of the larger rocks. 

Highly recommended and one of the easier ways to reach such a high peak."
102,2016-09-10,[''],Loved the view
103,2016-09-05,[''],"Beautiful mountain, but be aware of snow conditions in early season. I went in late May & the trailhead was still snowed over. Trail was not discernable & summit ridge had cornices the entire length.

I would be interested to see a report from a winter summit"
104,2016-09-05,[''],"this may be only a 2.6 mile out and back trail but it packs in a exilerating work out. Between the large rock steps and elevation change you may looking for a breath at almost 12,000 feet."
105,2016-09-03,['hiking'],BEAUTIFUL
106,2016-08-27,['hiking'],Fantastic views of the surrounding lakes. Nice moderate hike but the altitude makes it just a little more difficult.
107,2016-08-15,[''],Loved it. Pack a lunch. There are great views at the top. You will want to stay a while.
108,2016-08-07,['hiking'],"Weather can change quickly. Can be very windy. 
Route is pretty clear. Not too hard. Greatly rewarded by the view in the end. Worthwhile effort!"
109,2016-08-03,['hiking'],"Hiking doesn't get much better than this. Short but narrow and steep in places. Stunning views at the top. Bring a jacket, windy at the top. Loved it!"
110,2016-07-20,[''],Epic hike
111,2016-07-10,['hiking'],This was a great hike.
112,2016-07-03,['hiking'],The views were spectacular you can see everything from the top. Also saw a lot of mountain goats which was cool. But it was very cold and windy at the top and was about 4 miles long. Still some snow and temps at 40 or 50 at the top even in July.
113,2016-07-02,['hiking'],"I'm not much of a hiker. In fact this was my first in over 10 yrs. I'm from east coast so these peaks were completely amazing to me. I was in SLC for work and ended up with a half a day of time on my hands.
First of all, I'd like to say that I loved it. It was steeper and a little more hazardous than I expected, but that's part of the adventure. The side of the Mtn trail is steep and a long way down. There was still some snow to go around up near where the tree line ended. It levels out and opens up about half way up which is a nice break. I should have brought water but didn't and the snow came in handy.
After the level part the trail curls around and starts to ascend steeply again as runs along the steep grade. As I rounded a corner, I came face to face with a very large Mtn goat. He was not the least bit afraid of me and was only 25 ft away. At this point the terrain was very steep and the trail was very narrow, he could have easily sent me for a 2000ft fall.
That's when I turned around and headed back down the Mtn.
Great experience. Great views. Loved seeing the goat, even though he scared the crap outta me."
114,2016-06-25,['hiking'],Still snow on part on the trail so we had to scramble over rock but beautiful at the top
115,2016-05-30,['hiking'],Spectacular views! And fun scrambling on top.
116,2016-04-25,['hiking'],"This hike was not that bad, but for some reason I got elevation sickness on the way up. It was a great hike, we got some geocaches along the way. When we got to the top we found a box with a note of a girl who had cancer and shared her story. She also wanted people to sign the log and send a prayer, we did so and took in the amazing view. It was a wonderful experience."
117,2016-02-11,['hiking'],"Spectacular views at the top. This was the most memorable hike of my life because it was my first real hike up a mountain, and we got stuck overnight! We hiked up to watch the sunset but by the time the sun went down, darkness came quick. We lost the trail and after falling hard on my shin I told my boyfriend that we could not keep going down so we literally spent the night on the jagged hard side of this mountain... The night sky was the most beautiful I have ever seen in my life, I felt like I could touch the stars. When we got up in the morning we found the trail in about two minutes and ran the whole way down to the car! It was a crazy time, and I would not take it back for anything in the world. Great sunset hike, just don't get stuck taking too many pictures like I did or you might find yourself stranded on Baldy for the night. We went around June 13th and we encountered snow going up, the weather was chilly up top, very quiet hike you can hear the road miles away from the top, incredible moment of my life."
118,2015-11-22,['snowshoeing'],"We parked the car near Lost Creek Campground, because the road was inaccessible past this point. We strapped on the snowshoes and took off down the highway to the trailhead. We eventually were not able to pass further, due to snow conditions and avalanche concerns. The trail was still relatively easy to follow, even though it was covered in snow and nobody has been through yet this season. The area was absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and quite. We loved the views of the surrounding area as we climbed higher, and the solitude was something you don't often get in this area. If you can get out here in the winter, I highly recommend it!"
119,2015-10-25,['hiking'],Awesome!!
120,2015-10-19,['hiking'],Amazing views for such a short trail. Really loved it!
121,2015-09-06,[''],Loved it!
122,2015-08-24,['hiking'],"Its definitely my #1 hike. Views are to die for!! ITs a bit challenging because of elevation level. Get plenty of water, jacket (it gets very windy and chilly on top) and nuts if you wanna take pictures with chipmunks."
123,2015-08-18,['hiking'],Perfect for kids to feel what it's like to reach a really great summit!
124,2015-08-17,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes! Didn't see any mountain goats (we were probably too loud) but the views were definitely worth it. We also lucked out and managed to go up later on a day without getting caught in the usual afternoon thunderstorm.
Although the terrain is rocky, it's larger rocks that make for good stepping stones and not the smaller shale bits that can make a path unstable. It can be steep but also levels-out some so you get a bit of a break here and there."
125,2015-08-17,['hiking'],Amazing hike! Steep starting off and at the top but well worth it when you get to the top!
126,2015-08-16,[''],Excellent hike. Beautiful views of the surrounding valleys. Challenging at times.
127,2015-08-07,['hiking'],Great short day hike with beautiful views.
128,2015-07-18,['hiking'],Loved it. Not very hard and gets you to incredible views of tons of lakes
129,2015-07-10,[''],Amazing views. One of the prettiest hikes.
130,2015-07-01,['hiking'],The mountain goats at the very top of Bald Mountain made this hike worth it. This isn't my typical type of hike as you'll ascend up dry rocky terrain pretty much the entire hike. The views are quite spectacular and didn't have any issues with mosquitos. I'd bring a poncho in your backpack just in case bc it did rain on us for about 10-15 mins on our way up. Luckily we were able to find shelter under a scrub bush. Bring binoculars and have a great camera lens as you'll get spectacular pictures of lakes all over the place and beautiful mountain goats.
131,2015-06-21,['hiking'],"Payoff is incredible for how short this hike is. Most of the snow has melted (06/20/15) with only one section where you can alternatively scramble on rocks instead of the snow that are near the cliff.  I wouldn't consider this hike easy (moderate for sure), since you gain quite a bit of elevation really quickly and you're already at high altitude (10,693 ft) when you start.  According to my Strava app, the round trip was closer to 2.5 miles with an elevation gain of 1400 feet from the parking lot.  Bring plenty of water since the wind really dries you out.  I went through 2 x 16 oz Gatorades and I never drink more than one. Also some dogs were struggling coming down the scramble section of rocks near the top."
132,2014-10-10,['hiking'],"As far as hikes go, it is moderate with lots of rock in the trail. It's steep in sections but really a cool hike. The views are incredible. It really is a quick ascent as well. If you don't have a lot of time and you're there it is worth stretching the legs out on this trail. It has the most reward for effort."
133,2014-09-09,[''],"Pretty easy hike and very beautiful at the top. Went early September, and it was chilly at the top. Take a jacket."
134,2014-07-29,['hiking'],"We were able to get to the top in a little over an hour, and that was with several stops to take pictures. Stunning views from the top. There was a spot where I could count 20 lakes all around us."
135,2013-09-11,['hiking'],Great vistas and view of the Uintas!  We had to turn back on the saddle due to rain coming in and didn't want to chance lightning.  Great access to heights just below 12000'.
136,2013-07-26,['hiking'],A great hike for the family. Take it slow and easy with the kiddos. Beautiful scenery and perfect cool weather in the summer.
137,2012-09-25,['hiking'],"I hiked this trail September 22, 2012 and really enjoyed the views at such a high elevation with 12 lakes to one side and 4 on the other side. Those were just the ones I counted. I saw two mountain goats in the distance and numerous kayaks in mirror lake. The sun felt wonderful on my back as we ate lunch on the summit. It was a beautiful hike. "
138,2012-08-25,['hiking'],"This is fun for everyone.  I great trail for anyone to hike, the trail stays away from the edges if you happen to bringing little ones.  Keep  tight a rein on though because it does have some high ledge areas.  We actual got to enjoy hiking around with the Mountain Goats on our way down.  Something you aren't going to see to many places.  A quick place to claim a 11+ hike.  I loved it!!!"
139,2011-12-24,['hiking'],My family camps at Mirror Lake and hikes up Baldy every year.  Fantastic views from the summit.  I also own the geocache at the top (Leo Tiger GCGKCQ).
140,2011-07-30,['hiking'],"Still some snow on the trail, but pretty easy to get around. "
141,2011-06-22,['hiking'],"Great trail. We took our dog and three kids aged 11, 9, 6. They were all able to hike to the top and were very proud of themselves for it. "
142,2010-09-10,['hiking'],Snow blocked the end of the trail so we never got to finish. 
143,1975-07-02,['hiking'],Great views from the top
