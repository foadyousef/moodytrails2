0,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']",definitely drive something that can handle rocky terrain.  our explorer did great. we parked further from the trailhead by the river and hiked up. took about 1 hour and 45 mins down. really rocky and rough on the way down. beautiful lake at top and views. we saw deer and wild Turkey 
1,2019-08-18,['hiking'],steep and rocky and the road getting to it needs a vehicle with good clearance but that keeps the crowds away. we backpacked in and stayed the night and only saw 2 other groups.

3,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"Trail conditions are dry, no snow, and we saw NO mosquitoes. Trail is very steep with scree and lots of loose rock. This combination definitely makes it easy to lose footing and slide. 

Another hiker reported bugs on this trail just a day or two ago. We did see common black ants and army ants, some flies, lots of butterflies, and some gnats at the lake. We brought strong DEET repellant because of the other recent trail report but we didn’t end up needing it. 

We carried 35 pound packs (inflatable SUP’s) and it took us 1 hr 15 min to get to the lake. We hiked VERY slowly - the pack is more than 1/3 of my wife’s body weight so we took our time. Without a pack or just a water bottle I think we could have done it in 40 min to the top. Coming down took us about 45 minutes, and I have a knee problem. 

The trail is very steep for the first mile. For the last 0.5 mile it tapers out to a gentle climb through a meadow and forest. Beautiful scenery and a great view of Mineral Basin and the back side of Snowbird resort. We didn’t see any other people on the trail until the end. There were a handful of tents at the lake and room for plenty more. We loved the hike. It was our first time to Pittsburgh Lake and I would do it again. Once arriving at the lake, we traded our view of Mineral Basin for one of a rocky cliff wall to the North.  

The forest road getting to the TH was in great condition. It is very rocky in many sections but no problem with high clearance vehicle. I would say 4WD is definitely not required but I wouldn’t recommend bringing a vehicle without high clearance up. There were, surprisingly, many who did - even a Corolla! There are simply many sections with large, unavoidable rocks that could do major damage to your vehicle. If you want to park at the TH you will have to cross the river. Not a problem for my 4Runner, but with lower vehicles I would definitely park before the river and just walk the extra 0.15 mi."

6,2019-07-16,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Road to the trail is so bumpy and requires a truck, suv or atv. Once you get there you have to walk through a very cold stream to get to the trailhead. These other reviews say you can drive through the stream but there is no way. It’s a very rocky and steep trail but the lake is beautiful once you make it up. Took us two hours to hike up and we are in fairly good shape and another hour down. Most difficult I have ever done. Very peaceful, not a single person out there. Great to do once but wouldn’t do it again."
7,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'snow']","Trail is very steep, making it difficult for some. The hard work pays off at the end, some of the most beautiful scenery you’ll ever see. Right now the last third of the trail is still under a couple feet of snow and the lake is still partially iced over. "
8,2018-11-17,['hiking'],"As advertised, the first mile is very steep but then mellows out.  It took me 1 hr 10 minutes up with some snow on the trail (Nov 17) during the last half mile.  It snowed all day and the lake was covered in snow.  Definitely will do again earlier in the year."
9,2018-10-14,['hiking'],"I picked this hike because of the name...what's Pittsburg doing in Utah?! I didn't research much just read a couple of comments. Luckily I was in a jeep. The long dirt road is very treacherous. You definitely need a high clearance vehicle for this road. Really, don't attempt it without one. Huge boulders in the road. The map took me to the exact right spot (using Apple maps) and then I pulled up the all trails app to find the trail and stay on it. I was wondering how a mile and a half hike could be rated hard and then I did it. Yep. Straight up. I saw no one else on the trail - but it was October and snowy! I was sad to not see a moose and then saw a huge bull moose right at the end!i will definitely go back in the summer and maybe camp overnight. It really was beautiful and worth it."
10,2018-09-30,['backpacking'],Beautiful but brutal hike! Very peaceful at the top.
11,2018-08-26,[''],How are you peeps finding this trail head? I followed Google maps in my F150 yesterday and the road just turns into an impassible four wheeler trail. I had to turn around and go to silver lake with the rest of Utah county.
12,2018-08-26,[''],Super fun pack light
13,2018-08-23,['hiking'],Great trail to get away from the crowds. And the water temp was perfect for a swim.
14,2018-08-13,[''],Tough hike.  I took my 10 year old daughter on her first overnight backpacking trip.  This was definitely a tough hike. Great fishing.
15,2018-08-06,[''],"We followed the AllTrails directions and ended up 1.8 miles from the trail head. We started walking and realized there was a road below the trail we were on - so circled back to the car and followed the map and ended ip at the right trailhead. The hike is hard because it is so steep. Views are beautiful and the lake is Amazing. not a hike for beginners, this one kicked our butts. But now one of our favorites! ."
16,2018-07-23,[''],Great secluded hike! I will be going back with a fishing pole.
17,2018-07-04,['backpacking'],Camped at the lake. Nice area
18,2018-07-02,['hiking'],My fiancé proposed to me at the top! It seemed he had superhero energy climbing up and I guess now I know why! We had the whole place to ourselves and it was magical.
19,2018-06-19,['hiking'],I really loved this trail! Before you even get to the trailhead you have a rocky road and then a stream or two to drive through. Then it’s about a 39 degree incline over a mostly boulder covered trail. Great views all the way up. Once you reach the top it’s well worth it. We hiked this in early June and didn’t see a single person while on the actual trail. It was slightly chilly once we reached the very top but not terrible. I wish we had had more time to climb up the boulder hill and check things out a bit more once at the lake. I will definitely be going back to stay the night sometime. Take a hammock and a small dingy to float around in once up there.
20,2018-06-11,['backpacking'],This is one of the most beautiful I know of. The hike is a stair stepper but the pay off at the end is so worth it. It you hike up to the ridges above the lake you are looking down on the back side of snowbird. I can’t recommend this hike enough. Typically we hammock when we camp up here. Camping spots are limited.
21,2018-06-07,['hiking'],"Recommend practicing for this hike on a stair master, well worth the effort.

22,2017-08-30,[''],"This hike is steep and rocky. I wouldn't recommend it for beginner hikers. The lake at the top was gorgeous, along with the views along the way. The only thing that would have made it better is if I had brought my fishing pole."
23,2017-08-06,[''],"Very steep for the majority of this hike. The rocks are incredibly loose and would not recommend this for beginners or kids. The lake was beautiful and the drive was fun, but man oh man, it's steep!!!"
24,2017-08-03,['fishing'],"Started the hike around 0630. The creek to the trailhead is low so driving to the trailhead was no problem, just took it slow to avoid ""bottoming out"" in my AWD Durango. The hike is short (thank Baby Jesus) but quite steep and their is a good stretch of loose rocks which makes it a difficult to gain traction. I started early to avoid the heat of the sun but by the time i made it to the lake the sun was in full swing. There are plenty areas for shade around the lake which made fishing very comfortable. I caught about 10 small beautiful Brook Trout, about 8 to 12 inches, using yellow power bait and garlic flavored paste (they seemed to hit on that every cast). Action was constant but seemed to be only small trout which made it difficult to set the hook, but a great time and well worth the effort. oh yeah, forgot to mention the breathtaking views and beauty of the area. We had a moose hang out in the lake with us all day!"
25,2017-07-12,['hiking'],Great hike! Although you definitely need a jeep or similar to access the trailhead
26,2017-06-30,[''],Tough hike. Did it today. Had the lake to ourselves.
27,2017-06-29,['hiking'],"Great hike, I was looking for solitude and I got it. I didn't see a single person on trail. It was hard to find the trailhead due to the river running down the road. So if you are going anytime soon (as of 06/29/17) remember to cross the river as soon as possible. You can drive across it. Very steep, and rocky at first. Even though this is a shorter hike plan on several hours. The dirt road is long and very rough. Don't take a car."
28,2017-06-27,[''],"Absolutely wonderful! I did this hike last fall and it was one of my favorites! Off-roading was so much fun (to get to the trailhead) and although it was a pretty steep incline to get to the top, it was so worth it. Very peaceful, and beautiful crystal clear water."
29,2017-05-31,[''],"This is a beautiful hike with a great lake.  There is a lot of elevation gain.  I haven't had much success fishing here but I have seen people catch them.
We saw 3 moose the last time we went there.  There is an old miner's cabin that is still standing, however, not all the walls are intact.
Make sure that you use the GPS coordinates to find the trailhead.  You have to drive through a shallow creek bed before you enter into the parking lot.  You will also want a vehicle with high clearance to get there.  The road is very narrow for about 1/3 of a mile where it is hard for two vehicles to pass each other.  There is a rock wall on one side and a cliff on the other side.  I prefer to travel from Tibblefork reservoir to the trailhead on an ATV.
The hike is definitely worth it."
30,2017-01-21,['camping'],"To begin, you will need a high clearance vehicle, or an off road vehicle. The road to the trailhead is rocky, and in some parts, extremely narrow. The road is about 6 miles long, and in order to get to the trailhead, you have to cross the river that is paved with cobblestones (sort of) but then again when it is in some nasty dirt road. The trail itself is extremely steep, because you are gaining just over 1500 feet in 1.5 miles. The trail is rocky and is south facing, making it extremely hot in the summer afternoons. Definitely a morning hike in my opinion. The lake itself is fairly clear, and there are plenty of brook trout, even though they are pretty small, the biggest one I saw was about 8 inches. The cabin on the south side is cool, but is far different than the pictures here. The whole front has been torn off due to people using it for firewood or to make rafts. Overall, one of my favorite places to go camping because of the low traffic."
31,2016-10-04,['camping'],"I was never able to reach the lake because the road that leads to it was an offlly treacherous road. it was an old dirt road that was used for mining. It climbed along side the mountain, some areas were a steep drop off, and the road went for about 6 or 7 miles till it came to a complete stop. to reach the lake you would have to hike at least 4 miles one way. I don't know if there is another route but I would definitely recommend taking a razer or ATV up to the lake."
32,2016-09-20,['hiking'],The directions on AllTrails took me to the wrong spot...it wanted me to drive down this path of huge stones and the 7 miles of rocky road I had already went down was already pretty terrible. It was super pretty along the way though and I ended up hiking on some trail that led to Mineral Basin but I never found Pittsburg Lake after going about 3 miles in. I'd love to find the lake sometime and figure out if there's any other road there! I was driving a Kia Soul but I'd definitely recommend driving something much bigger than that.
33,2016-08-17,[''],"Went to go hike this trail - drove there in my car. Just a heads up, the ""dirt road"" to the trailhead is 6 miles of basically a riverbed with large rocks jarring out all over the place. Got about 1.5 miles in before I decided to turn around because it wasn't worth bottoming out or popping a tire, as it continuously seemed to get more treacherous. 
Everybody I had passed, was either in a Truck, Jeep, or other SUV. Lots of 4Wheelers cruising along too. Would HIGHLY recommend getting there in one of these, and not a car or low-clearance vehicle."
34,2016-08-15,[''],Pretty steep but 100% worth it! Definitely would do it again.
35,2016-07-16,['backpacking'],"I give this 5 stars purely because it is so secluded where everywhere else is getting so busy these days. This is a steep and rocky hike, which does make it a bit challenging. But it's totally doable and totally worth it! Just remember to pack out what you pack in!!"
36,2016-07-13,[''],super steep. but magnificent!
37,2016-06-21,['hiking'],My favorite hike because you never really see folks up there and it's peaceful. Water is ice cold but after you jump in you will feel refreshed. Lots of fish up there. You gain elevation in a shirt period of time. Lots of loose rock on the trail so be careful coming down.
38,2016-06-20,['hiking'],Loved it
39,2016-06-12,[''],"Super awesome hike. The loose rocks and steep incline is what's rough in parts, but the hubby and I did it with our 5 and 9 yr old. Definitely worth the hike!"
40,2016-05-31,['hiking'],A short but steep hike. Great scenery that ends in a lake you can jump in and cool down.
41,2015-11-05,[''],"Short and fairly steep, but remote and incredibly gorgeous. Fun view of Devil's Castle from the south."
42,2015-07-27,['hiking'],It's one of my favorite hikes there is! It's not long but definitely gets your heart pumping because of the elevation gain in a short period of time but not many people are up there. I have some cool pics on Instagram of this place @dan_the_mountainman
43,2015-07-14,['camping'],"This small lake is packed with fish! There are several primitive campsites around the lake. The hike is a bit rough through the middle third. We made it with two 9 year old boys. The area itself is full of fun and adventure for children, if they can make the hike. Be careful in the way down."
44,2015-07-13,[''],Not a kid friendly hike. Our 4 year old did it but complained the whole time. It would be a great hike without kids. Beautiful lake and scenery.
45,2015-06-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful scenery, but the middle section is STEEP and ROCKY.  Going up and coming down are challenging though this section.  Poles will help.  The lake itself is stunning and teaming with small trout.  On the way up you see the top of the Snowbird Tram and Mineral Basin.  The trailhead can be hard to find.  Guidebook says 6.1 miles up from Tibble Fork turnoff to the right and cross the stream."
46,2015-05-04,['fishing'],A great hike but definitely strenuous. This winter was mild so I didn't hit snow on the trail until the last quarter mile or so. There was just enough ice melted around the lake to fish it and they were definitely cooperative.
47,2014-10-09,['hiking'],"Nice easy 1-2 hour hike to a beautiful lake.  A bit steep half way up the trail, so take water if you're in the summer heat.  Great fishing in the lake, albiet small trout--great time!"
48,2014-03-31,['hiking'],"I do this route every year.  The first half of the trail is brutal.  Steep, loose, and exposed to the afternoon sun.  The lake has small Brook trout, and I have caught (and released) as few as 20, and as many as 70 in a couple of hours fishing using a small fly.  The boarding house has been torn down by careless hikers (mostly scouts) to burn or build rafts.  The mining office is almost gone for the same reasons.  Someone recently tacked a tarp around two sides to enclose the shack once again."
49,2013-08-07,['hiking'],"This is a family favorite.  The trail is steep and rocky, but short enough for my 5 and 9 year old to hike it.  The lake is beautiful, the water is so clear that you can see all the little fish swimming around.  It would be a great place to camp."
50,2013-07-29,[''],"The hike up was pretty sketchy with all the small rocks that creates an unstable ground for most of the hike as well big dead tree on the trail. I recommend not hiking up or down hill at night. Heard coyote so I ran down hill then later saw some big eyes so I screamed but it barely move so I knew right there and then it's not a deer because when ever I scream and if it's a deer it would jump far away. Picked up more adrenalin while seeing more eyes. Scares the crap out of me in the end. Fly fishing was nice and relaxing for small brookies. Most were 5-8"" "
51,2013-04-07,['hiking'],This is a fun place to stay the night. If you can swing it do it midweek and you will have the lake to yourself. If you hike up to the ridge it a great view. 
52,2012-07-30,['hiking'],Awesome place.  Pretty tough hike when hauling overnight gear but it's short enough that it's worth it.  The fish are very small but it's still a good time and if you know the history of the place it's even more of an experience.
