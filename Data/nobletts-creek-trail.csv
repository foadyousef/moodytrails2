0,2019-08-25,['hiking'],easy hike along the stream. very pretty
1,2019-08-12,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Took our kids and everyone had a great time.
2,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Great trail! Very clearly marked with blue flags in trees. Mostly shade and you can hear the Creek the whole way. Nice easy hike!
3,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'bugs']","This little hike has it all. It is easy to access off a large parking area. There is a lake at the beginning, mountain views, colorful flowers, gorgeous running and still water. Although the trail is easy, there is a gentle incline with a few challenging spots that get the heart rate up. I would highly recommend bug spray, especially if going in the evening. "
4,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Beautiful trail! I wouldn't call it a waterfall, but the creek was lovely and cool. Quite humid and buggy, but I would definitely recommend. There's lots of shade at the time we went."
5,2019-07-30,['hiking'],Great easy hike! Took a 5 year old who usually doesn’t do well on hike and He didn’t complain at all! Walk in nice shade along a river and is perfect quick hike for anyone! 
6,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"Nice trail, pretty easy, half hour in, half hour out. Pretty waterfall at the end. I usually hike solo but saw lots of families. Supposedly, dogs have to be on a leash. I saw four, all friendly but none on a leash. "
7,2019-07-17,['hiking'],Spectacularly beautiful hike! Lots of wildflowers! Lush green forest with a creek the entire way. Bring bug spray. Our dog loved it!
8,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"This was perfect for my 6 and 4 year old. They were able to walk the entire way. Largely shaded. A nice, cool summer hike!"
9,2019-07-08,['hiking'],This is our favorite family hike in the Uintas. Little kids can hike the entire trail. Beautiful hike right along the stream the whole way up with lots of places to stop and play in the water. 
10,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"One of my favorites, my kids love having the water right next to them. Not hard at all, had 5,7,13 years old and one dog. "
11,2019-07-06,['hiking'],mostly flat and pleasant listening to the river most of the hike
12,2019-06-25,['hiking'],"Nice hike and a great way to spend the early morning. Both my 6 and 9 year olds had no problems. It's hard to not be in a good mood with the water rushing by in the creek and every passerby you meet enjoying themselves. Plenty of little opportunities to investigate the water and flora and fauna, like the ants burrowing into the fallen trees, or the numerous water-tolerate species of plants, in all their different forms.

13,2019-06-10,['hiking'],"This hike is a beautiful stroll that is easy and welcoming to everybody. The snowmelt has the water levels pretty high at some parts, so do keep an eye on your kids and pups. Otherwise, there is a good amount of shade and calm parts of the stream that make for a lovely time. The trailhead is right off of the road, so you can’t miss it."
14,2019-05-05,['hiking'],muddy and snow on the trail but a nice hike.
15,2019-05-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'snow']","Still lots of snow on the trail, as it melts will be more dangerous with the drifts. We managed to complete it without snowshoes but there were a few moments where the trail was unclear due to the snow. Watch for the marked blue diamonds on the trees, it made it pretty clear for us. We were the first ones on the trail since the last snow and had to pave our own way."
16,2019-01-20,"['hiking', 'snow']",Hiked this today with my 10 y/o on snowshoes. It was pristine and beautiful. We blazed half the trail in 15-18” of fresh powder. Once we dropped back in we didn’t hear the snowmobiles out at the main parking. Definitely do this again to see it in the summer. Loved.
17,2018-09-10,[''],"The hike was great. It was busier than I expected based on other reviewers not seeing anyone. I wish people would follow leash rules for their dogs, though. We met 2 people who had 3 large dogs all off leash. Not only does this make me uncomfortable, but it also can damage the environment. The dogs were going in and out of the creek where there were beaver dams built up, not to mention the fragile moss and small flowers at creekside."
18,2018-08-31,['hiking'],This is a easy but beautiful 2.2 mile up & back trail  The sound of the stream is always heard and for 90% of the hike you can see it.  The most difficult is the beginning section that had a 30 degree down slope and the same up slope at the end.  This section is only about 30 yards and can be slippery.  The trail is narrow but well maintained gained with a few clearings to rest and take in the great views all around.  The trail is 95%-98% in the shade this time of year.  Getting to the parking area is well described in the app.  Will do it again with additional guests.
19,2018-08-20,[''],My all time favorite! Perfect little hike.
20,2018-08-18,[''],Love this trail. Runs by a river/stream for most of the trail. The trail is pretty much shaded the whole way. Anyone in the family can enjoy.
21,2018-08-06,[''],Beautiful and perfect for kids!
22,2018-08-05,['hiking'],"Took the kids (3 &5) today. It was I think perfect for them. Steep in places but nothing they couldn’t handle. Hardly anyone on the trail, only one other family. The river follows for most of the time, which is nice for them to play in."
23,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"Two words: Bug Spray! There were also a ton of flies.  But despite that, this hike was incredible! My 5 & 3 year old did so well and loved every second! We hiked on July 6, and it didn’t feel too hot since it was shaded 80% of the trial. The water is amazing and the greenery is so lush! I’ve never seen anything like it. We live 1.5 hours away from this trail and we will be going again for sure!!!"
24,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"Fabulous short hike. The trail follows a beautiful stream and ends at a little waterfall. We had our dog and 11 and 9-year old kids, and they loved it. Good for all ages. Not many mosquitoes but a few flies. Overall- great hike!"
25,2018-07-04,[''],"I was expecting more based on the reviews I read, so I was somewhat disappointed after finishing the hike. Nice view of the water flowing over the rocks at the end but overall I wasn’t entirely impressed. Some wildflowers scattered along the trail. Most of it was shaded though which was nice. We saw a huge heard of sheep being herded down the mountain across the creek on our way out which was probably the most entertaining part."
26,2018-07-01,[''],Probably my favorite hike for kids. Make sure you stop by Mountain-Hi (in Kamas) for lunch and a milkshake!
27,2018-06-28,[''],"Great trail, beautiful and easy enough for our 9 and 4 year olds!"
28,2018-06-18,['hiking'],"Absolutely gorgeous! A little bit of everything that makes me smile. Flowers, water, trees, dramatic rock formations, aspen trees and small meadows."
29,2018-06-18,[''],"This is a gorgeous, well-marked trail great for kids. Thick, healthy flora provides shade most of the way."
30,2018-06-17,[''],An absolute favorite hike for the whole family. Easy trail. Well marked. Follows the river all the way to the falls at the end. Lots of shade makes it perfect in the heat.
31,2018-06-14,[''],Yes it is a simple trail but with everything you could want in a hike. Cascading water over moss covered rocks. Wild flowers everywhere. First time I have ever seen wild irises. Incredible deep forest smells. Willows every where. Bird song. This will put you in an incredible mood. I have been out of Utah for years but this brought back all of the memories of my youth in Utah. I came from Texas nd this fulfilled all of my expectations.
32,2018-05-30,['hiking'],Very beautiful trail. Definitely a beginner trail. I did not pass anyone at all on the trail.
33,2018-05-30,[''],love every minute of it. i have been hiking it ever since i was a kid
34,2018-05-16,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail!  Nobletts Creek is really running high with all the run-off.  A couple sections were a little washed out, but we crossed them without getting our feet wet because of the plentiful logs and boulders.  The mossy creek is so beautiful!  I would have given this hike 5 stars, but the forest service has cut down a bunch of trees and left them along the trail.  I know the cut logs will decompose and it’s good to remove trees for safety reasons, but seeing cut logs everywhere detracted from the beauty.  But 4 stars is still really good, and the kids (15,12,9) has a great time."
35,2018-05-13,['hiking'],"Other than the doe that walked close to us, we had the trail to ourselves. Still had some snow in spots but a really easy walk. Finished off the morning with breakfast at Woodland Biscut company."
36,2018-05-06,['hiking'],"Still some snow and it can get slippery in some areas. Good hike for kids, But the river is going very fast this time of year."
37,2018-04-28,[''],"Easy hike, about hour and half in and back."
38,2017-10-20,['hiking'],"Took the kids, it was great.  The trail had spots of mud but the temperature was perfect.  Beautiful hike and we will be doing it again soon."
39,2017-08-13,['hiking'],I really liked this trail. It was super easy and the view is amazing.
40,2017-08-04,['horseback riding'],"Rode horseback with two young boys.  Trail is a little overgrown but extremely beautiful.  You basically ride up a picturesque little river/creek until you get to the end where there is a gentle waterfall where you can sit and take pictures.  BEWARE.... at the end of this trail there is a small sign which has been damaged saying ""end of trail""  HOWEVER, the trail is very well travelled beyond making you think you can go on but it basically goes up and becomes a cliff side which you can not tell it will dead end into the side of a cliff util you are way up in there and there is now room to turn around.  This is a very dangerous mistake on three horses with youth."
41,2017-08-01,[''],Great for kids. Take insect repellent!
42,2017-07-29,['hiking'],Easy and beautiful.  Water is flowing great and refreshing.  Great for kids of all ages.
43,2017-07-25,[''],"We just did this hike the end of July 2017. Took our six-year-old and we all brought water shoes. My daughter LOVED this hike! Almost the whole trail was shaded so it was nice and cool. It follows the creek and there were many shallow places to stop and go walk/wade around in the freezing cold water. There are no downed trees blocking the trail, everything was cleared away. There were fallen trees that crossed the creek and were loads of fun for kids to walk across. The trail is easy to follow. The waterfall/spring at the end was beautiful and was a strong current so keep a hold of your kids. Definitely worth the 1 hour drive to get out of the heat/valley."
44,2017-07-25,[''],this was a perfect hike to do with kids of all ages!
45,2017-07-15,['hiking'],"Beautiful family friendly hike. This hike was so enjoyable even in the middle of the summer because of the trees, shade, and water. There were so many sights to enjoy on the way up. The creek, birds, butterfly's, wild berries, and lush greenery made the hike to be quite an adventure for my three sons (ages 10, 7, 4). Make sure you take the right side of the creek to stay on the easy path which is clearly marked with blue diamonds all the way up to the top. The left side was said to be a bit more complicated and not so family friendly. The final destination was fun and different. I'm not sure that I would call it a waterfall but more of a rushing spring as the water comes directly out of the side of the mountain which was just as cool as a waterfall in my opinion! We went a little bit past the ""end"" sign and hiked to see where the water was coming from. My son said he liked this hike more then the narrows. I would recommend it if your in the area."
46,2017-07-05,['hiking'],Great family hike. The stream and shade make it very pleasant and the waterfall is a fun destination for young and old.
47,2017-06-26,[''],So beautiful!  Enjoyed this hike!
48,2017-06-23,['hiking'],"As others have said, this is a great hike.  If you just go up the trail on the right side of the creek, which is I think the correct side for this trail, you reach a waterfall in just over a mile of walking through the woods with the creek running alongside.  There is a sign saying ""End"", which is kind of a clue that you are done.  As mentioned in the previous review, the creek is running very full right now, but I had no problems staying dry. I think the AllTrails description above, talking about the trail on the left side of the creek, is for the Log Hollow hike, which does not go the same way, and is considerably longer."
49,2017-06-22,['hiking'],"This is an absolutely beautiful hike! Took us about an hour to get there from Salt Lake. The directions from All Trails took us right there. There is a parking lot and there are 2 restrooms. The trail starts in the middle of the parking lot and heads left. Because of  all the snow we got this winter the creek is crazy full. We couldn't get to the end of the trail without walking through water. There were also quite a few places where the trail was obscured by fallen trees and you either have to go around, over or under them. It was shady almost the whole time and my 6 and 9 year old did great! We also didn't see very many people, about 5, the whole time we were there. We will for sure be doing this one again."
50,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Gorgeous views, smells, and sounds. Pack a picnic and enjoy!"
51,2017-06-14,['hiking'],Very fun! Very secluded and great views with a fun creeks flowing next to you!!
52,2017-06-11,['hiking'],"Did this hike today with my wife who is 7 months pregnant. Great hike, very gradual elevation gain and great for all levels of hikers. The creek and waterfall are beautiful. All of the downed trees have been cut and cleared within the day or two. There were still about 4-5 places where the trail was covered or mostly covered by water but you can get past them using logs and rocks and stay basically dry depending on your balance. We had a great time and we will definitely be returning to hike this trail again."
53,2017-06-07,['hiking'],"A beautiful and isolated area near ""Kamas."" I'm rating this trail highly  
because of the sense of scenery and feeling of escape offered in an underrated part of Utah. Hiker ""beware"" though, the trail is full of fallen trees that can be difficult to traverse and some areas also covered with water; which will require your feet to get wet. The trail needs to be more maintained. Other than that it is a very nice and quite. Me, my baby(on my chest) and my wife were able to get through the trail barley with all it's troubles. Another family did turn around during our trek. We were determined to finish the trail and will want to revisit in the future for its positives. Some or most may want to turn back with all its obstacles."
54,2017-05-12,[''],"This is one of my all-time, favorite easy hikes. In the fall you will be delighted so see wild raspberries and wild gooseberries. The waterfall has gorgeous moss covered rocks. Fun family hike."
55,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"wonderful time of year, warm but breezy."
56,2016-05-30,['hiking'],Very beautiful and peaceful.
57,2016-05-19,['hiking'],Trail starts about .75 miles from main road. You can park at the bottom and hike up or drive up the road and park at the start of the trail. Lots of shade. Easy for kids.
