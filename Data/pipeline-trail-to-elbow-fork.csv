1,2019-08-24,['trail running'],another section of the pipeline but this one has some vertical from porter to the higher bench compared to the rest of the pipeline 
2,2019-07-07,['hiking'],Great time today! Very quiet and peaceful. Encountered fewer than 20 people the entire time. Handful of cyclists. 2 were jerks and actually forced us to jump back from the trail as they came flying by; everyone else on the trail was friendly. Will definitely do again and incorporate into a longer hike. 
3,2019-05-27,"['hiking', 'no shade']","What a beautiful Spring day! It was a quite sunny day but not a lot of shade on the trail. However, the trail wasn’t as busy as I thought it would for a Sunday afternoon. You definitely want to bring at least 1.5L of water, sunscreen, and a snack when you get hungry. Take a friend or your puppy! Millcreek Canyon is a dog-friendly canyon. Remember odd days are dog off-leash days and even days are biker days on the trails.

5,2018-09-03,['trail running'],"great trail for running. a lot of bike traffic tho. after you get all of your gain in, in the first mile and half or so... its an easy breezey flat run.

6,2018-07-26,['trail running'],"Beautiful trail. Mostly flat after initial steep climb from trailhead, not too challenging. Views are stunning. Great for trail running. Watch out for snakes! "
7,2017-10-23,['hiking'],"I wish I did this 2 weeks ago - just missed all the leaves changing. However, still beautiful. A storm blew in around the end of the hike, so make sure you are prepared. I would rate this as easy because it is mostly a flat walk. Great for trail running and mountain biking. Overall I loved it and would do it again."
