1,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Good quick hitter close to town.  Brought the whole family, 9 yr old, 12 yr old and a dog.  Its a legit 1600 vertical in just under 2.5 miles so prepare for ""are we there yet"".  You are there when you get to a sign for Deer Creek/Dry Creek trail and North Mountain Trail.  Go left, look left and you'll see the trail, there's a rope tied to a tree.  That's the short trail to the falls.  Good water availability for the dog and its September so I assume that's a low point. "
2,2019-09-02,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! The falls really look like a horsetail. Be prepared for a very steep hike. Most of it is shaded.
3,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']","I started at 8am so the sun hadn't come up over the mountain yet, making it so much easier to hike, since it was seriously an incline the whole way.  Read others reviews, I am glad that I did or I may not have noticed the turn off just past the sign where the rope down was. This way led to the lower falls, had I gone straight, I think it would have gone up to the top. The falls were very nice! The way down was partially  shaded since the sun had come up by then. A snake crossed over the trail in front of me. Great hike, but I am glad I went alone so that I didn't slow anyone down. "
4,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Love this hike! So much shade and even though there were quite a number of people, the trail is nice and wide. Saw lots of families and little kids but the ""moderate"" rating felt pretty accurate for non-avid hikers like us. "
5,2019-08-30,['hiking'],"Great trail. The first 10% is hot and exposed, no shade. It gets better after 10 minutes. When you get to the meadow you’re about half way. The 2nd half is the best part of the hike. Keep going for 30 min. When you get to the split and you see the sign, go left, 50-100 feet up on your left a small unmarked trail cuts down to the lower falls. There’s usually a small ribbon on a branch marking that trail. Follow that trail for 5 minutes and you’re at lower falls. "
6,2019-08-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Gorgeous hike, super rocky at some spots, never found the falls but still lots of beauty to be seen. Will be going back with a group to find the falls later this week "
7,2019-08-30,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'over grown']",Amazing Hike! Honestly one of my favorites. You can easily get lost. You may want to watch this video before you go... https://youtu.be/5RUI_msMzXE
8,2019-08-29,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","Beautiful falls. The trail is not as muddy as the spring. There are some bugs, but not enough to annoy. Horse poop everywhere, and the whole trail smells of it."
9,2019-08-26,['hiking'],Fun hike very beautiful. Hard to find the trail to the falls. You have to take a left at the fork and then you take a left about 10 yards into kind of a drop off trail.
10,2019-08-24,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",
11,2019-08-20,"['hiking', 'rocky']","First, don’t think you missed the turn to the falls at two miles. It’s closer to 2.2 miles to the left of the sign in the middle of the trail. Beautiful Falls area!  "
12,2019-08-20,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",
13,2019-08-20,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Pretty trail, very rocky. All the water is near the end of the trail. There are many offshoots that may lead down to the creek that you can hear from the trail, but we didn't try. The rocks are very slippery near the falls, even the dry ones so be very careful!"
14,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'rocky']","The hike is nothing spectacular. Steep. Trail is rocky a lot of places. the waterfall on the other hand is fantastic! hiked up behind it to some cool ponds and small waterfalls.
Only saw a few people; probably because it was 3pm & 98 degrees. would recommend going early. Didn't see any snakes."
15,2019-08-15,['hiking'],Awesome hike. Definitely straight up hill. The falls are gorgeous. Very shaded so it makes for a great hike any time of the day.
16,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"Shaded trail most of the time! Straight uphill for the most part, about 2 miles up. I did encounter a bobcat, so be on the lookout. Really beautiful waterfall!"
17,2019-08-08,['hiking'],Ran out of sun. Had to come down early.
18,2019-08-04,['hiking'],Somewhat steep. I'd say this trail is similar in both time and challenge to the lower falls at bells canyon. Make sure you are somewhat prepared for breathing. 
19,2019-07-30,['hiking'],Beautiful
20,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"This would be a good trail for those under 40 and in reasonable good shape. This is not a moderate hike and not suitable for those 65 and over unless you are in excellent health and decent condition, as it is rather rocky and quite steep in many places. Expect to spend 1 1/2 to 2 hours hiking to the falls. You can reach a meadow in 45 minutes to one hour. If your looking for a moderate hike, try Battle Creek falls in Pleasant Grove. "
21,2019-07-28,['hiking'],I am always looking for dog friendly trails and this one was great! Definitely an incline the whole way up. I thought it was a pretty good workout but kids definitely were rocking the trail and even passed me at one point haha. It was mostly shaded but I definitely recommend hitting this trail earlier in the morning it was pretty hot.
22,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Beautiful views at the end! We got a good workout with the steep climb and rocky trail. 
23,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
24,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"Beautiful, shaded, and a great pace!"
25,2019-07-26,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Beautiful Ending at the falls.  Definitely worth going all the way to the falls.  Watch closely for the turn off.   I’m a slow hiker, but hike often and would consider this a hard hike with the elevation and rocky path. "
26,2019-07-26,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, gorgeous falls! Constant incline so be fueled up, and have lots of water. I can see how people would get confused on where to get to the falls, just watch for the drop off on the left with the black rope once you’re around the 2 mile mark. "
27,2019-07-25,['hiking'],Great trail.  Took 3 hours with 5 and 7 year olds.  But they stayed entertained and loved the falls
28,2019-07-24,['hiking'],Great hike.  Hot and fun!!
29,2019-07-23,['hiking'],Beautiful hike but definitely a workout. 
30,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'rocky']",great hike! the start doesn't have any shade but the rest is well shaded. It's a great workout! 
31,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Incredible hike. Would definitely recommend. We got a good workout
32,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"Great trail! Uphill most of the way to the falls and you will be crossing some narrow logs and walking through some wet, muddy paths. I went a month ago and the falls was roaring. "
33,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"Great hike, not very difficult at all.  It is up all the way but the falls are beautiful and we saw plenty of young kids hiking the trail!  Plenty of shade along the way and we will definitely take this trail again.  It is a great visitor hike."
34,2019-07-20,['hiking'],One of our favorites! 
35,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"Amazing hike. The waterfall was awesome. First hike of the year for our fam. We are dead tired after. Mom, Dad, and five kids 15, 13, 11, 8, and 3. All made it but the youngest three complained a little at times and the 2 year old we carried up and down. 

This is a beautiful hike. Plenty of shade and things to see."
36,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"The trail is well-maintained and isn’t too steep. I agree with the moderate ranking. The first part of the trail is exposed but the majority is shaded. I went last Friday and part of the trail was covered with water, which was really cool. Be sure to check out the top of the falls!"
37,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Gorgeous Hike, the waterfalls are breathtaking. Definitely worth the steep 2 Mile hike! "
38,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"This hike is a butt kicker, and the reward is beyond worth it! Beautiful hike up. Loose rock along the way, so be prepared to watch your step a lot. Shaded most of the way. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
39,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Very nice hike. I went with my daughter on a Sunday.  Minimal traffic, 50% shade.  It was fun and refreshing wading through a little water (to my knees at the highest point). Several great photo opps.  This trail is not well marked along the way. After you see the one wooden sign,  go left and down a little alcove, not up like I did at first.  Overall beautiful and fun hike!"
40,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Great hike and a little challenging for the little kids. (4,5,10) We didn’t hurry it took about 4-hours up and down. It sure felt like more than 3.9 miles. Be sure to check out the falls at the overlook they are stunning. "
41,2019-07-13,['hiking'],This trail is fantastic! There is a lot of shade after the first part of the hike and the river/falls are raging with water right now. Be sure to check out the top of the falls too!
42,2019-07-12,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
43,2019-07-11,['hiking'],I love the wooded section. and the waterfall is beautiful. 
44,2019-07-10,['hiking'],"Amazing hike! And a good workout! The falls are amazing right now and I love how you can hear the running water alongside the trail the whole way. Trail is mostly shaded so good during most times of the day. Yes it is a little rocky at times, and there were a couple spots you had to jump rocks to cross little streams but I thought that just added to the adventure! *bonus down near the beginning of the hike you can take a short hike down to the river and lots of trees for hammocks! Made for a perfect day! "
45,2019-07-09,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",My mom and I loved this trail!! We even saw some people coming down on their horses! It is steep and rocky so be careful and aware. The signs here aren’t the greatest so to get to the water fall you’ll see a sign with a fork in between. On your left you’ll see where it goes down onto a rocky-ish pathway with a black rope. Follow the trail for about 5 minutes and you’re golden! If you keep going straight when you see the sign you’ll go up and around the waterfall which gives you a great view. Steep and rocky but overall amazing. 
46,2019-07-08,['hiking'],Loved this hike. The waterfall was still flowing fast. Just don't miss the little turn off to the left to get to it. Its small and we missed it the first time. went back an found it. Loved it!
47,2019-07-07,"['hiking', 'rocky']","We had a fantastic time on this hike. It is well shaded, but rocky so you need to watch your step especially on the way down. The views of the waterfall are amazing! Well worth the incline/distance. "
48,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"Awesome trail once you get past the first mile. The first mile is pretty steep and not the most fun, but when you get into the trees the trail is well kept and super fun. If you hike a ways past the falls you can head up to boxelder which is an awesome spot to enjoy."
49,2019-07-06,['hiking'],Hiked with the kids this time (9 & 11). It was more of a challenge for them than I expected but they made it and managed to have some fun. Their favorite part was taking pictures of everyone's dogs!
50,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"Great hike!  Stream crossings over logs and even a rope to help with a steep decline to get to the waterfall. Gorgeous and fast water!   I'm 50+ and kids there, but it's Utah moderate... lots of uphill and rocky.   Loved it!"
51,2019-07-04,"['hiking', 'rocky']",A lot of rocky uphill climbing. Challenging and beautiful. The waterfall at the end was definitely worth it. Love hiking through the water at some points. 
52,2019-07-03,['hiking'],Good and challenging hike heading up to the falls. The waterfall was raging. 
53,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"Challenging in areas due to incline coupled with loose rock, but doable. Definitely worth the gorgeous view of the falls. Beautifully forested. You can hear the water below the trail; I wish there was a trail to walk along beside the water. Maybe there is and I am just not familiar. But a great hike nonetheless!"
54,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"I loved this hike, it was just the right amount of difficult with the most amazing view at the end. It took our group of 6 about 2 hours to get up, enjoy the waterfall and come back down. "
55,2019-06-29,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. go early and it's mostly shaded. about 50 yrds of the trail is the stream right now. your feet will get wet. falls are raging with runoff. 
56,2019-06-29,['hiking'],Beautiful waterfall 
57,2019-06-29,['hiking'],beautiful hike with a nice elevation climb!
58,2019-06-29,['hiking'],This was my favorite Utah hike. I couldn't believe how beautiful it is at the top - I wish I had known about this hike sooner. I think we'll add this to our list of hikes we do every year. There are a few stream crossings that are fun. The waterfall is perfect right now - super strong flow. 
59,2019-06-27,['hiking'],"just keep to the left at every ""fork"" and you'll be up there in no time. There is water on the trail up a ways, but nothing you can't get through."
60,2019-06-26,['hiking'],"Went on a hike with my 1-year old daughter on my back. There are three streams you have to cross. To get to the last stream, you a have to walk through some water then cross logs to get to the other side. Difficult but doable. Unfortunately, in order to get to the falls you have to go down a steep hill. Wasn't able to get to the falls with my 1-year old."
61,2019-06-24,['hiking'],"Challenging in places, several sections of the trail are filled with lose rock. The trail and the views are very amazing and the falls at the end are absolutely breathtaking!"
62,2019-06-24,['hiking'],Most Enjoyable!  3 stream crossings..... some of us went right through the water and some stayed dry.  Marked great for our first time we had no issues.  Falls were raging and just beautiful!  
63,2019-06-23,['hiking'],"A couple stream crossings that we weren’t prepared for with my small dog but that’s my bad for not reading a lot of the details. We never made it all the way to the falls, I think the hike outlined here just takes you to a viewpoint since we had already done 2.1 miles at that point and we’re still pretty far. We went 2 weeks ago and it was definitely pretty muddy and the stream was basically running down parts of the trail. Hopefully by now it’s a little more dry. Very beautiful scenery though and great views from the top even without getting right up to the waterfall. Not sure if I’d do again because it was pretty steep and the bugs were out in full force but really pretty and loved being in the mountains. "
64,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Gorgeous hike and the falls itself is flowing with abundant water. My pup enjoyed it a lot but it’s muddy and around 3 streams of water along the the trail 
65,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Great little hike! It’s dog-friendly, which is nice. We went last week, and the trail was still pretty muddy. No snow from what I remember, but plan on you (and especially your dog) getting a bit muddy."
66,2019-06-17,['hiking'],beautiful hike! we got off trail and ended up going way past the falls! but we eventually found it. Tons of water to go through! 
67,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Had a hard time determining which path was the right one. We ended up primarily on the north side of the river after taking a clear bridge across but never ran into the other crossings? It was still pretty but we never made it to the top top because we were too out of shape to keep hunting for it 
68,2019-06-16,['hiking'],"Fast flowing falls today on a wet and a little muddy trail.  Having said that, I hike in Nikes and did just fine with no wet feet.  Recommend a walking stick for the water crossings."
69,2019-06-16,['hiking'],Great hike with a great waterfall.  Plan to get shoes wet but worth it.  
70,2019-06-15,"['hiking', 'muddy']","The raging falls make the climb so worth it! Plenty of shade the majority of the time. Lots of walking through water and river crossings. The hardest river crossing was easier today than a week ago thanks to someone dropping more logs across. Make sure to look for the left turn off just after the sign. It’s easy to miss, but takes you right up to the falls!"
71,2019-06-15,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Three river crossings. the last one is knee deep (I'm 6' 3"") and turbulent. Kids probably can't finish it. Very pretty, though"
72,2019-06-13,[''],"beautiful trail! shared with horses and was quite steep, but there was plenty of room for people to rest on the trail while still letting people pass. When we hiked the trail, there were some stream crossings that didn't have bridges, but that could be because the water level has been high recently. "
73,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","I would recommend this trail for anyone looking for a pet friendly trail. It is very beautiful with creeks and streams, hence the muddy comment. I would definitely recommend using the app to know where you are going, I got lost a couple of times. So did the group behind me. "
74,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'muddy']","We went on the beginning of May, closer to the falls was muddy, hiking shoes are highly recommended. The powerful waterfall on the end is awesome. We meet some wildlife featuring a rattlesnake. The trail is short so, we kept going up to the top of waterfall. Our kids had a good time they are 11 and 14. There were people hiking with kids much younger, our dog is part of our gang so she was with us. Expect many dogs since they are allowed on the trail. "
75,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",
76,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'rocky']","This is a great little hike. There are several stream crossings with makeshift bridges, so getting wet is optional. Only a few parts of the trail are muddy. Deffinently worth the hike."
77,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Beautiful hike! Steep hike, muddy and a few areas where you’re walking through water up top. I was in tennis shoes and I was fine but I’d plan on wet feet right now. My pup and I made it to the falls and its absolutely gorgeous right now. Totally worth it!! Plus he doesn’t mind playing in the water along the way. "
78,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Trail has stretches of mud and stretches of hiking through streams, plus several stream crossings, but most of us kept our feet dry enough in regular shoes if we went slow and careful. We hiked with a few 10-12 yr olds and they did great! The waterfall is spectacular right now. Beautiful woods and beautiful views, too. "
79,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'muddy']",There is a lot of water! Beautiful hike and well worth the uphill climb! Water crossings are a little swift but plenty of footing take your time. Runoff is coming down a large portion of the trail near the top so be ready for some mud.
80,2019-06-09,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike and the falls are RAGING right now. I am always amazed that we have waterfalls like this hidden in our “backyard”. It rivals Bridal Veil in my opinion. The trail is pretty steep, and the stream crossings are a little trickier than normal for this hike, due to the amount of run off. One of favs in the area."
81,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'scramble']",
82,2019-06-09,[''],"lots of water this week.

"
83,2019-06-09,['muddy'],"Beautiful hike, the water at the river crossings is running high because of all the spring run off so maybe bring shoes that can get wet, all in all a great hike! "
84,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",Crossing the final bridge to get to the waterfall water is going super fast be careful.
85,2019-06-08,['hiking'],Loved it! Well trafficked. Worth the uphill grade all the up. Waterfall was AMAZE BALLS!!! Ran the last 1.2 miles down. Great run! Coming back again.
86,2019-06-03,[''],"Awesome hike with great views, the falls are amazing."
87,2019-06-03,[''],great hike. a little muddy but beautiful. a little more advanced than I expected because it's all uphill. 
88,2019-06-02,[''],"probably the nicest waterfall that I have seen yet and it's raging pretty good right now.  I disagree somewhat about the trail being really muddy.   There is water running down the trail so of course the trail will have some mud, but if you are careful you don't have to hit too much of it.   Have fun....I know I did!!!!"
89,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","We went yesterday and it was still really muddy. You should be prepared to climb over rocks and through a few streams. Proper hiking footwear is advised. 

The roar of the waterfall is amazing. When you see the sign about Dry creek go to the left and then take the first path over to your left (small unmarked footpath) that will take you to the best view point of the falls. 

Side note:  despite this being a leashes dog only area many people let their dogs off leash. This makes it difficult for those dogs that are frightened of approaching dogs. Leash your dogs people!"
90,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Moderate hike, very muddy in lots of areas right now. A few creek crossings. Steady incline, but not anything crazy steep. Once you’re pretty close to the falls it’s not very clear where exactly to go. Make sure you have access to the app if you don’t want to wander for a bit to find where they are. The waterfall is AMAZING right now. Raging like crazy. The view is spectacular. Seriously an awesome hike. "
91,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",
92,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
93,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"Great hike. It was fairly muddy/wet for the last leg. We hiked with our 4, 7 and 9 year kids and they did well on it. The waterfall was raging. I imagine the water decreases later in the summer but the trail would be dry... which would make it easier."
94,2019-06-01,[''],"It was so beautiful! The trail was muddy and there are a lot of rocks on the trail. There were lots to walk across higher water areas. The waterfall was amazing!
"
95,2019-05-28,['hiking'],"It’s a consistent gradual incline all the way to the falls. Very muddy in many parts. Beautiful views from the falls. Going a little further up will also put you in view of the pools above the falls which are fantastic. There is flowing water on the upper portion of the trail, worsening the muddiness, definitely should wear hiking shoes/boots, not tennis shoes."
96,2019-05-28,['hiking'],"Weather was beautiful. Trail was muddy in places, but not impassable. Kids did great, but we took it a little slower. With the two kids it took us about 2.5 hours round trip (we stayed for a while at the top). Spotted a moose off the trail. Waterfall is raging and amazing right now."
97,2019-05-27,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'washed out']","Beautiful, and not too difficult! It would be hard w babies or young toddlers, but 6+ would be fine (with of stopping). It rained last night, so it was very muddy on many parts of the trail. "
98,2019-05-27,[''],"Love this hike and exploring the area! spring hiking is ana,big, wild flower and a great fall from winter runoffa"
99,2019-05-27,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",Decent trail with a beautiful waterfall view at the top. Hard to notice the turnoff to the bottom view of the waterfall. It's about 30 feet past the sign for deer creek trail on the left and looks like a washout. 
100,2019-05-26,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","So we enjoyed this hike. I would not however say this is kid friendly nor would I rank it as “moderate”, it’s a bit strenuous, and I exercise everyday. It’s an incline the entire 2 miles up. I think if we hadn’t done it without our three kids it would have been a lot easier. Totally doable without kids, we actually finished the hike, but we saw at least two families with kids turn around because it was just too hard.  Also, it’s important to note that the 2 miles gets you to a beautiful view of the falls, but not to the actual falls. If you want to go to the falls (put your feet in and be at the foot of them) you have to go about a half hour longer.  Anyway, overall, good hike, but not my favorite and it was tough with kids."
101,2019-05-25,['hiking'],I would recommend this trail to anyone it was awesome and good for dogs and kids
102,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
103,2019-05-20,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Beautiful trail. Lots of water, some on part of the rocky trail. Little muddy in places. Good traction shoes needed. "
104,2019-05-16,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']",Went on a Sunday mid day and the parking lot was full. Had to park on the side of the road a little bit down from the parking lot. It wasnt far and the car was okay. The trail can get warm the first part there is a lot of sun. But there is also shade patches you can stop in if you need to cool down. The further up you go maybe at the mile and a half or 2 mile marker there is a creek running over the road for any dogs that may need a drink. I highly suggest you keep your dogs leashed on this trail since it is frequented by horses. Also towards the top there are a couple heavy water crossings but there are tree bridges that help you not get wet. once you see the trail sign at the top your turn for the lower falls is on the left hand side not far passed that sign. It looks sketchy and there is a tiny rope to help you up but that is the way to get to the lower falls. The trail also gets narrower and there is lots of water on that little section but you are going the right way. if you pass that trail to go down to the lower falls you keep following the current trail you can get to the top of the falls. I also heard there are Cascades at the top that feed into the falls but I did not see that. The trail is a constant up hill hike. My Garmin registered it at 5.5 miles total. Totally worth the hike. I recommend trekking poles. Almost every hiker I saw had something even if it was a stick they picked up. No need for snowshoes or spikes.
105,2019-05-16,"['hiking', 'muddy']","This hike is definitely a favorite of our family, dogs included.  Today the trails were super muddy and we were not able to make it to the falls. Fairly certain it will dry up fast but giving a heads up for those heading there the next several days."
106,2019-05-13,['hiking'],"Completely amazing! To get close to the water falls be sure to turn LEFT about 10 yards from the sign you encounter an hour from the trailhead!
"
107,2019-05-13,"['hiking', 'muddy']","I can't believe I haven't hit this hike before. The whole hike was gorgeous, and the falls were stellar. So beautiful. There was a little mud, but we managed to avoid most of it. Lots of it was shaded which was nice since we went late morning."
108,2019-05-12,['hiking'],this is one of my favorite waterfall hikes in the Wasatch area. this time of year will be free of snow but have a little mud and lots of water at the falls.
109,2019-05-12,['hiking'],Fairly steep hike... last the majority of the trail still a bit of snow and some stream hopping... definitely worth the effort especially at this time of year with the winter run off making the waterfall rage!!!

111,2019-05-12,['hiking'],"Now is the perfect time to hike this trail. Mostly shaded and dry. Some mud and water trickling down the trail near the falls, but lots of rocks to step on to stay mostly dry. We slopped right through in our hiking boots, no problem. At 2 miles, turn left at the sign and another sharp left at the drop off. There’s a knotted rope to help you down."
112,2019-05-12,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Loved this!!! Totally lived up to they hype. Great views the whole way up, about 50-60% shade on the way up, and many water crossings. Muddy towards the top, basically snow-free as of May 12. Small parking lot at the trailhead, there were 2 spots open when I arrived at 4:30 p.m. on Sunday. Definitely familiarize yourself with the map beforehand... there are a lot of side trails that are misleading and I missed the turnoff for the falls. I met 4 other folks on the trail who did the same thing. As soon as you see the wooden sign towards the top, turn onto the small side trail to the left.. look for the small black rope tied to a tree trunk that will help you down onto the side trail to the falls. Took me 3 hours rt with lots of stops."

117,2019-05-09,"['hiking', 'muddy']","One of my absolute favorite waterfall hikes in Utah county.  Right now the water is roaring and it's a sight to behold.   I ran this trail, but there's definitely some uphill that may challenge some younger hikers, but given extra time, doable.  At about 1.7 miles up, you end up crossing several streams and the trail itself becomes a creek but you can rock hop or walk the side without much trouble.  just make sure to watch for the drop off just beyond the trail side to the left to find the turn off to the waterfall."

121,2019-04-29,"['hiking', 'snow']",Was a great hike yesterday. It is always one of my favorites. Ran into spotty snowpacks about half way up. The fall is spectacular right now.
122,2019-04-28,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",I hiked on 4/28/19 - the snow and mud started after the fist mile or so. This was a fun trail and the waterfall is woth seeing. I plan to do it again in a few months with my kids
123,2019-04-28,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","This was a fun trail. There aren't any signs that say Horsetail Falls trail, but it's up there. There is still snow on the trail, but I didn't need to use any spikes. The last part to the waterfall was confusing if you've never been there. There will be a fork at the end, go left. Off to the left of the trail there's a break in the trees/ bushes that takes you down a little ways onto a dense trail. You follow that to the waterfall. It is also really wet right now with the runoff."
124,2019-04-20,['hiking'],"Apr. 20, 2019. Fun, moderate hike to a gorgeous waterfall as well as a pretty great look out back on Lehi into the valley. The upper 2/3rds of this hike currently has a few feet left of packed down snow most of the way. Yaktrax are a nice addition but aren’t absolutely necessary. Not much to see along the way up, but towards the top it opens up for some views."
125,2019-04-20,['hiking'],"the lower third of the trail is dry but then there is a lot of snow and ice patches. If you are going past the meadow, you will want to have spikes."

133,2019-02-18,[''],"A strenuous hike in places, especially the last 1/8 mi. or so. Beautiful view of falls. Watch for fork and stay left. Rope is tied to limbs on left side of trail shortly after taking fork and was in good condition earlier this season. I like to continue on falls trails (not descending on rope) another 25 + minutes and cross on logs suspended over Dry Cr. and return to trail head using trail on North side of creek."
134,2019-02-17,['hiking'],"The beginning of the trail is a little drab, but once you actually get into the canyon it’s really pretty. The snow is packed and easily accessible with spikes - icy in some areas from all the sledding on the trail. A bit annoying dodging all the sledders coming down while you’re trying to climb some of the steeper parts. Nice quick hike - takes about 45-60 min up at a moderate pace, 20 min down if jogging."
135,2019-01-30,['hiking'],"Hiked this morning with poles and Yaktrax, both were helpful. I think the difficulty level is neither moderate or hard, but somewhere in between. Saw only a few people.

137,2018-12-27,[''],I loved this hike. I went on a backpacking trip with some of my friends up here and about 10 minutes before getting to the waterfall there’s a little fire pit and a bunch of trees where you can set up a little camp and hang up hammocks. The view is beautiful and yes it was kinda hard carrying a bunch of your gear up the trail (because it’s just straight up) but it was so worth it. There’s little ponds that you can either look at or you can swim in (only if you like freezing cold water) but either than that it’s a great trail. It takes about 1-2 hours (depending on your pace) hiking up but walking back down feels like 10 minutes.
138,2018-12-18,['hiking'],"It was a gorgeous hike. Covered in packed snow for the majority of the way, so it got a little slick in some parts. I had a toddler on my back so that definitely made it tougher in the slick parts, if I were to do it in the snow again I wouldn’t take the kid. I ended up above the falls but I think there was probably some good views I missed out on below. The way to the falls wasn’t marked so that’s why it’s only 4 stars not 5 but I’m going to try again when there isn’t snow and see if it’s better."
139,2018-11-21,['hiking'],"This is rated ""HARD"" but find it to be intermediate; it shares the same trail for the Dry Creek Trail which is rated Intermediate.  Went Mid-November 2018 and it took about 2.5 hours with stops for pictures and taking in the views.  Trail was a mix of compacted dirt and some loose rocks so wear shoes with ankle support.  Trail was clear of snow and there was only one icy spot about 1/4 mile up past the trailcamp meadow.  I was easily able to walk through the brush and avoid it.  The dead horse is still on the left of the trail just past the post for the 046 trail (on the right).  The horse did not smell and was half buried, however my pup's nose had no trouble finding it.  Only docking because the signs for the falls didn't exist."
140,2018-11-10,[''],We went in November and the trail was rocky for a good portion of the trail and icy in a couple of spots but mostly dry. The falls leaves were mostly fallen. There was little to no signage to point us toward Horsetail Falls but we veered right at the first two forks and then went down a path to the Lower falls. Spectacular views and wonderful to see at dusk. It took us 2.5 hrs to go up and back.
141,2018-11-04,[''],"This is a beautiful trail (minus all the horse poop).  The signage to the waterfall could be improved!  It’s a steep climb but take your time, you will be be rewarded with nature beauty"

143,2018-10-21,['hiking'],awesome hike! packed my 9month old and a bag with food and my tenkara fly rod. my wife had a little rough time but did great. The water shed has fish! wild brown trout. they loved the shop vac nymph.
144,2018-10-11,['hiking'],Love this hike. It’s awesome. The water slide at the end is cool too. Not sure why it’s rated hard though. This is moderate. Don’t be intimidated. It’s pretty trafficked though for sure. One of the best endings in my opinion. :)
145,2018-10-09,['hiking'],About 2 miles up when you approach the sign that points to the waterfall take a sharp left down onto the smaller trail. We thought it was telling us to go straight so we missed the turn off. Took a little over 2 hours round trip
146,2018-09-08,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes in Utah County. I've probably hiked it 20 times. The Horsetail Falls are spectacular but you need to be very careful on the rock. It's incredibly slippery.
147,2018-09-03,['hiking'],"This is labeled an out and back, but more accurate is an up then down.  2 miles straight up with maybe 2 or 3 very short flat sections. 

Coming down is no picnic with old knees. "
148,2018-08-29,[''],"i love this trail but im currently in the hospital because of my last hike there with a broken femur and pelvis to not get into too much detail. the rock is extremely slippery. do no get close to edge if not secure, do not walk on wet rock if not secure. this is one of the most amazing hikes in my life but i almost died because i underestimated some slippery rock"
149,2018-08-29,[''],Great hike we did in 2016.  Can be strenuous for those not in shape.  Kids ages were from 8 to 13.  Go on the early summer when the waterfall is at its best!
150,2018-08-25,[''],Saturday hike was amazing.  A lot of hikers on the trail. Some of trail had water from recent rain   Falls were beautiful!
151,2018-08-20,[''],Beautiful hike. Hardly saw anyone else on trail. A bit confusing when you get closer to the waterfall but we were able to find a nice shady spot near the water.

Anyone giving this a bad review probably just has a bad attitude. 

The falls are beautiful, and there are some great views. 

Sunday afternoon was a great time to do this. I only ran into a few people."
155,2018-08-12,[''],did this hike today. very steep in places very beautiful wooded hike with the sound of the river always near and the falls at the end was amazing. well worth the hike.
156,2018-08-02,['hiking'],Fun hike! We went mid-day and we're grateful to have some occasional shade. I would recommend doing this hike in the morning when it is not as hot. The waterfall is definitely worth it when you get there!
157,2018-07-28,[''],"Incredible views! Stunning evening hike, beautiful all around, with the perfect amount of challenge!"
158,2018-07-12,['hiking'],"Pretty steep, but not bad if you hike a lot. Took the turnoff with the black rope, to see the bottom of the falls. Rock climbed, next to the falls, up to the upper falls.

Was an enjoyable few hours with my brother and his 10 year old daughter. She was a champ and handled the hike very well. She also rock climbed up the falls with us.

Packed on the weekends, so if you can do it on a weekday you'll be glad you did.

Scenery is beautiful and it's not a real long hike."
159,2018-07-12,[''],A ton of loose rock on the trail knocks off a star for me - other than that this hike was great. The waterfall is unbelievably cool and it's one of the harder 4-mile hikes around.
160,2018-07-11,[''],If you love Rocky terrain and lots or horse doodoo this is the trail for you. It's a great workout with very little to see when you get to the falls (if you can find it) not much shade and only a couple of trees to sit under. I wouldn't recommend this trail to anyone!
161,2018-07-05,[''],Greats hike and views!
162,2018-07-04,[''],Great trail. As the small trail to the falls can be hard to find. One hint. Around the 1.85 mile point their is a fork in the trail. Stay to the left and look for the trail break off about 20 yards up the trail.
163,2018-07-02,['hiking'],We went with family and it was awesome! The falls and the granite rock were beautiful! It is mostly up hill all the way to the falls. Don’t miss the turn off down to the falls like we did. :) We hiked a bunch more than we needed to.
164,2018-06-30,['hiking'],Loved this hike. We went to the upper and lower falls. Both are easy to miss and not marked. We had someone show us after we missed the turn to both. The waterfall and pools were beautiful and the shade was appreciated. It was steep and hard on the way up but not terribly long. I also agree about the unleashed dogs. PLEASE leash your dog. Not all hikers like to share the trail with pets.
165,2018-06-29,[''],"One of my favorite hikes ever. Lately though there are so many dogs off leash it’s become scary to hike on the trail. Dog owners, THIS IS A LEASHED TRAIL! Your “nice” dog running and barking at me is frightening. Please leash your dogs!"
166,2018-06-24,['hiking'],my dogs favorite hike ❤️
167,2018-06-23,[''],"went this week with kids ages 11-15. took some fellow hikers advice to go up along the river which was gorgeous and shaded and then cut back on the main trail through the meadow. It was a bit tricky finding the meadow amdain trail but definitley worth going along the river as long as you can!

The turn off for the actual waterfall os marked with a black rope around a tree that we would of missed if others hadnt of told us. and it is not an easy path once you get off the main trail to see thw actual falls but totally worth it!! gorgeous and breathtaking. I would say ages 10 and up if your trecking to the actual falls. If you dont go that far up cut over to the river as it is beautiful and shaded."
168,2018-06-23,[''],"Beautiful hike to absolutely beautiful falls! Not too steep, but would be easy to miss black rope turnoff if you didn't know it was there"
169,2018-06-20,['hiking'],I do this trail a few times a year. Nice and shaded areas but pretty steep.
170,2018-06-19,['hiking'],"Hike up in about an hour. The turn off to the falls is easy to miss. Look for the ledge with the black rope.

On the return I kept heading up the mountain where there are two logs to cross the stream. From there don't go up the hill, but take an immediate left, and return on the Lake Hardy trail. The trail is poorly marked, so you'll definitely need a GPS and map."
171,2018-06-18,['hiking'],"Moderate, pretty steep but not too bad. Pretty waterfall at the top"
172,2018-06-16,['hiking'],"We did this as an evening hike. it was great! Luckily it was cloudy, the weather was perfect. I'm glad I didn't take my kids, the trail was steep and rocky. We hiked down to the falls, using the path with the black rope. We also hiked up above which also had great views."
173,2018-06-13,[''],first time hitting this hike and I was pleasantly surprised. Had just the right amount of incline for a really good workout but not kill you. Beautiful pine trees along the way and a gorgeous waterfall the top made it well worth the hike.
174,2018-06-11,[''],Beautiful waterfall at the top! Worth the hike!
175,2018-06-10,[''],"What a workout. All of it is up hill and full of rocks but what a view when you arrive! Took a couple breaks along the way to rest and catch my breath but it was worth it. We missed the left turn to the waterfall and had to back track, so be careful. Look for the black rope."
176,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike.  Steep and loose dirt makes slipping a hazard.  Walking sticks are helpful especially coming back down.  Well worth the effort.  Took 2 middle aged ladies 3 hours to get there since we were talking the entire way!  One hour to come back down the canyon. The rope seemed challenging but some fellow hikers were encouraging and we made it.  Down was slippery, back up was a piece of cake.  The rope is past the bridge over the stream to the left side.  You won’t know it’s there unless you’re looking for it.  What a spectacular view of the canyon and Utah Valley below."
177,2018-06-07,['hiking'],The falls were amazing! So pretty.  Be careful to not miss the cut off trail to the falls. We kept hiking up a very steep trail before we realized we needed to turn around. You will see a sign and take a hard left after it onto a trail with a black rope tied to a tree. Will definitely come here again.
178,2018-06-06,['rock climbing'],"Awesome trail with a payoff at the end. We climbed down to the falls and scrambled back up. Steep pretty much the whole way and I think our GPS gave us some extra mileage, but it did seem to be longer than 3.9 miles total. Worth every step!"
179,2018-06-06,['hiking'],"Beautiful shorter distance hike. On a Wednesday morning we only saw a couple of other hikers on the trail. Everything is so green right now, and we saw a variety of bird species. Great for a beautiful morning workout."
180,2018-06-04,[''],"I took my daughter on this trail last night. The views from the top are gorgeous and the waterfall is beautiful. It had quite a few shady parts but still hot for starting mid-day in the summer. It is pretty steep and rocky the whole way up, but definitely worth the views at the end."
181,2018-06-04,[''],"Beautiful hike! it was very green and gorgeous when I went up yesterday (June 2, 2018) the trail can be steeper at times, but always planes out, so it doesn't tire one out too quickly, which is very nice. :) 
Also has many beautiful vistas all throughout the hike of towering pine trees, and the valley below, and gorges, to streams and of course, the massive waterfall which looks like it has a horse tail! 
I highly reccomend this hike :)"
182,2018-06-03,[''],"Amazing hike! One of my favorites in all of Utah. Not really that hard though, should be rated a moderate."
183,2018-06-02,['hiking'],"Used this trail today to summit Box Elder Peak. Hang a right just before the falls at a signed intersection to keep ascending on 2043, then keep on trucking for a good while until you get to a spot where you can see down into the Granite Flat Campground. From here, you swing south on 2188 and basically just go up and up and up until you're at the top of Box Elder Peak! 

Saw oodles of wildflowers on this first day of June; oodles more are on the way in the next few weeks I'm sure. There's still snow up high, though nothing terrible as long as you're not the kind of person who likes to test their luck on avoidable cornices. I liked having my waterproof boots and gaiters, but I like fancy/luxurious things like that.

Probably something like 5,500ft of vertical gain all told?"
184,2018-05-30,['hiking'],"Rigorous hike with views of the falls, surrounding peaks, and valley worth every step."
185,2018-05-29,['hiking'],I’ve done this hike many times. 4.4 up and down and it takes me under 2 hours. It is steep and doesn’t let up. The falls at the top are amazing and I like to find a rock to hang out on. It’s pretty shady most of the way which is nice. People miss the falls a lot because the cairn which signals the hard left turn to the falls keeps getting destroyed.
186,2018-05-26,['hiking'],great view halfway up
187,2018-05-22,['hiking'],"I enjoyed every bit of this hike! Seeing the waterfall is way more impressive in person than in pictures! I learned via fellow hikers that the main path to the waterfall is considered the “south  trail” but there is a “north trail” that leads to a different fall (?) will have to check it out the next time I visit! Otherwise sunscreen, a 2L water camel, good pair of waterproof hiking shoes, and bug repellent will be your friend."
188,2018-05-07,['hiking'],Loved the reward of the waterfall! It was strenuous and we stopped frequently. Make sure to bring lots of water and sunscreen. It’s very rocky as well in some areas. Reliable shoes are a must!
189,2018-05-01,['nature trips'],Friday's hike on April 24th was a terrific outing. We passed by the falls headed towards Dry Creek crossing at 2.2 miles from trailhead and eventually returned to trailhead via trail on North side of creek. An ample number of flowers in bloom and encountered 7 Red-breasted Nuthatch as well.
190,2018-04-29,['hiking'],"We enjoyed the hike! It's pretty steep but not too long. It took us about 3 or 3.5 hours at a good pace with some breaks at the top. If you want a shorter hike, you can just go to the overlook, which is on the left at one of the spots where the trail splits. It's pretty from there too. The last part of the trail is quite steep--probably precarious if it was raining, and the trail feels small and almost like you are not going the right way. We think we got to the end, which was a nice spot of the falls, because the trail looked like it ended there. Right now, it's still pretty brown because leaves haven't come out much yet, so it's probably prettier later on. No snow or anything though. Also, we never saw a black rope where the description said it would be... And finally, we found some glasses and put them on the blank sign board at the beginning of the trail if anyone is looking for those..."
191,2018-04-23,[''],Great hike! Difficult but not awful. Worth it to go down to the falls. Just watch for the black rope just a ways up after the turn where the sign is.
192,2018-04-23,['hiking'],"This trail is tough, but the falls and view of the valley are worth it. The entire way up is a good climb, and the trail is pretty rocky."
193,2018-04-15,['hiking'],It was a good hike. Rocky but good. The second half was still covered in snow making it hard to navigate the rocks. The view was spectacle. Our dogs did good on this hike too.
194,2018-04-14,['hiking'],Hike and snowshoed to the falls and beyond. Very nice when the water is running high
195,2018-04-09,[''],We like to hike up on the left side of the river.  It's nice and shady much of the way.  Can't wait to hike it again!
196,2018-04-04,[''],"I usually hike the trail on the north side of the river, but I opted to try out the hike on the South side last night.  It is interesting how different the 2 trails are.  The South side is such a nice wide well maintained trail but is far away from the river that you can only hear it in the distance.  The North side is a narrow trail that hugs the river so there is scenic views all along the trail.  The South side has a nice straight shoot view of the falls, but kept hiking hoping to get closer and I never found an amazing view point of the falls.  I will have to do research but I watched for Kairns to direct me to the great scenic spot and there was a only 2 ok far away spots that were along the trail.  The North trail gets hard to follow up by the falls and if you miss a Kairn you can easily get lost. You are so close to the falls, but most routes to get close to the falls are precarious and a little dangerous to get down to the falls to actually see them.  There have been people who have died here with just a slip and if you end up in the water here you are just done for.   I think I still like the trail on the North side better for the views along the river are so amazingly beautiful, but that is not the official trail they want you to be on. So be careful when you get up to the falls and try to keep in your mind the landmarks of where those Karin's are so you can get back on the trail safely."
197,2018-04-02,['hiking'],"Uphill climb the whole way, but not too bad. Snow is all but gone and there are only few slick spots left. To reach the base of the falls, at the fork with a sign go left. About 30 feet up on the left you’ll see a side trail that’s a short, steep descent to a well traveled path. This brings you to the base of the falls where the magic really is."
198,2018-03-30,['hiking'],"The trail is mostly clear now--there are some long ice sheets in the last half mile before the turnoff to the falls. I had microspikes, but I suspect you won't need them if you trust your shoes. Waterfall was lovely--the 2 mile trail to the waterfall is more interesting when things are greener than they are now. The dead horse is still off to the side of the trail."
199,2018-02-05,['hiking'],"My wife, two small kids (6 and 8), and i hiked this during one of the warmest winters in history and there was still a lot of ice.  Not a very hard trail but you will need something to deal with the very slick conditions. Plenty of photo opportunities, gorgeous views, but come prepared."
200,2018-02-04,['hiking'],"If you follow the trail map here, you might wonder why so many people say this is a gorgeous hike, for it is quite boring.  That is because the trail on the south side is not pretty, and the trail on the North side is gorgeous.  The problem comes getting out to the falls.  Both trails are not well marked to get out to the Waterfalls.  I took the South side and was watching close for the trail to head off and totally missed it.  The north side I have hiked multiple times and each route is a little tough to make it down to the falls except the top view is pretty easy to get to.  If you want information in how to get to the pretty North side trail, I wrote pretty good instructions on my blog, and I will add a nice trail map of my route this week.  It is at Shaunasadventures dot com search Horsetail Falls.  The waterfalls are amazing, but be careful.  A man died here a few years ago when his dog slipped and he went to grab him and he was in before he knew it and gone.  It is a gorgeous falls, but be safe and careful around it."
201,2018-02-04,[''],great hike
202,2018-02-03,[''],"Really fun hike, way down was real slick cause of all the snow. But deffinetly worth the trip"
203,2018-02-02,['hiking'],Awesome hiking. Some snow and ice spots so walking stick or ski pole would be very helpful. Falls were beautiful and didn’t see a single other person on the trail (it was Thursday morning however).
204,2017-12-30,['hiking'],It was a fun hike! Beautiful waterfall especially in the snow! It was pretty steep on the way but was worth it!
205,2017-11-26,['hiking'],One of my all-time favorite hikes. Great place to go in the summer--you are going to want to get in the water by the time you make it to the top.
206,2017-11-25,['hiking'],"Very beautiful hike! The path to the lower part of the falls is hard to find, it’s off to your left as your hiking up. You go down a little path and can use a rope that is provided to get down the steep incline. We also saw a dead horse that was off to the side near the beginning of the hike."
207,2017-11-20,[''],This is a beautiful hike with amazing views.
208,2017-11-19,[''],Love it
209,2017-11-19,[''],I went on a mid-November day after a light snow the day before. Magical. I can't imagine the conditions can be improved upon this singular perfect day. Cue the Lou Reed. Make sure to continue straight past the sign and scramble over some rocky terrain all the way to the falls. Don't deprive yourself of the payoff at the end. Quite grand.
210,2017-11-03,['hiking'],"rocky, steep, and dusty. a great workout. but the trail is so rocky it kind of ruins the hike....unless you like rocky trails."
211,2017-10-28,[''],"Fairly rocky and steep in spots, but well worth the effort!"
212,2017-10-21,['hiking'],"Rewarding hike with wide somewhat steep trails. It took me 1.5 hours (I’m not a couch potato or a marathon runner; I land somewhere in the middle). Nice walkway to start with more rocks further up. Passed large boulder on right, then about 2/3 the way we passed a little meadow. Before crossing three streams, we saw a lookout on left. Well worth the 2 minute detour and path merged again with main trail. After passing three streams we came to sign in fork of trail, we went left and looked for little black rope on left. Would have been very easy to miss as it’s a tiny rope on a small trail. Amazing views at the end of that trail!"
213,2017-10-11,['hiking'],Beautiful hike with amazing views. Pretty busy on Saturday mornings.
214,2017-10-09,[''],"loved it, went Sunday morning and only passed a few people.  I wouldn't give it a hard,  moderate but not hard."
215,2017-10-06,['hiking'],"Nice hike, definitely an incline the entire hike.  Disregard previous post about ""keep to the left at all times"".This piece of incorrect info cost me about 20 mins. of hiking wrong direction. Here are couple tips: continue hiking up trail until you see the Large Wooden Post Sign titled Dry Creek Trail and at that point, GO LEFT. literally 30 yards after you go left, you will see the small animal trail on the left with the black rope tied to a tree. it's a steep decline, use the rope. follow the animal trail for about 5 mins, you will hear the waterfall. Took me approx 1:10 to reach the waterfall. Steep incline entire hike, you will cross 3 streams on the way up the hike. the ""meadow"" is about 2/3 of the way to the Dry Creek Trail sign. You can't miss the sign."
216,2017-10-02,[''],"Awesome hike,  it is nearly a non-stop incline but the waterfall at the end is outstanding.  you can get a peek at it worth about  .5 mile to go but if you have gone that far go the rest of the way.  it is well worth it.  as you are hiking up the trail there is a sign that someone has scratched in the water fall direction to the left.  If you go up that path about 30 yards there is a little path that goes down to the left.  someone left a rope (Thank you to whoever did that as it made way easier down and up). the path from then on is really small.  but once you clear the trees you start to hear the waterfall.  then you clear the ridge and get your reward."
217,2017-09-15,['hiking'],Do not come here even if it's just light rain. The water flows down like crazy along this trail when it rains and I got caught in a really bad situation.
218,2017-09-12,[''],The waterfall at the end is beautiful. We went in September I'd like to see the falls gushing in the spring. Towards the end watch carefully for the trail off to the left. Moderately steep hike.
219,2017-09-07,[''],Beautiful hike! Steep but worth the views at the top. Hoping they remove the dead horse off the trail soon.
220,2017-09-05,['hiking'],"Steep, unrelenting trail, though much of it was shaded. Along the way there were multiple paths but they all met up again. There was one hat lee to an overlook of the falls and you are standing on a large, rock outcropping. Instead of staying on that trail, go back to the main trail, unless you want to be almost bushwhacking up a small stream bed. Towards the end, there was a fork and I went left towards the falls, though the sign didn't say horsetail falls. After a few steps, saw what looked like a game trail going down and to he left but I kept going. Eventually the trail disappeared and I scrambled over boulders and arrived near the top of the falls. Scrambling down I found the trail back, which was the game trail I saw shortly after the fork. Once you are at the end of the trail you can climb down to the base of the falls but be careful."
221,2017-09-01,[''],Hard as balls!
222,2017-08-29,[''],"This is my favorite trail to take during the week! I can't even count how many times I've actually hiked to the falls. What I love about it is that it's much quicker to get to than if you were to go up AF Canyon. Though it has gotten a lot more popular over the years, it is still easy to find parking. It is beautiful throughout all four seasons. It has a consistent uphill that's great for conditioning as well. If you are new to that amount of incline, it will take you 1 1/2 to 2 hours to get to the falls depending on how many times you stop. For ones a little more experienced, it will be closer to and hour to the falls. You know you are getting close to the falls when you hit the large boulders and granite after you pass 3 streams (Sometimes just two if it is late summer or fall depending on the water level). I take about 33 mL of water and do just fine with some left over."
223,2017-08-27,['hiking'],Love this place for hammocking.
224,2017-08-15,['hiking'],"It was a good hike! Very rocky though so it is a good idea to have good hiking shoes that have ankle support. This was my first time hiking to the falls and there weren't clear directions on how to get to the falls. We went up past the fork in the road (stayed on the left) and ran into a group of BYU researchers who showed us a trail to get to the upper side of the falls. Apparently there is also a rope tied to a tree in your left, about 35 miles after the fork in the road, that also takes you there.

 When in doubt in this hike, keep going left when the trail splits.

Look through photos to see what the fork in he road and the sign look like. This is the fork in the road that will lead you to the falls. Go LEFT. There should be a trail about 35 yards past the sign. Look for a rope tied to a tree on your left hand side. Or, keep walking forward and you will come to a giant slanting bolder on your left with a narrow trail behind it. Follow this trail to also get to the falls. There is a pile of stacked rocks to mark the trail by the giant rock. The sign says, ""Deer Creek - Dry Creek TR NO. 043"""
225,2017-08-12,['hiking'],"took my boy scout troop (12&13 yr olds) here.  this was my backup plan of the high Uintahs didn't work out, and I'm glad I had a backup plan.  great quick local overnighter for scouts.  hiked to the clearing about 1.25 miles up.  solid little incline for the boys.  was a dead horse halfway up the trail, marked with a red hankerchief.  smelled it for days! ugh.  lots of fun tho, the clearing was perfect place to set up camp.  very popular this time of year, several sets of night hikers came through, with their headlamps dancing like fireflies in the south side of the clearing.  great fun hike.  people please pick up your dog poop bags tho! half dozen or so near the trailhead, how annoying is that!"
226,2017-08-09,['hiking'],Steep but rewarding.  Don't miss the turn off to the bottom of the falls at the cairn (go left at trail sign and the cairn is on your left almost immediately. Steep drop off with helpful rope.)
227,2017-08-04,[''],Beautiful views with fun waterfall.
228,2017-08-02,[''],beautiful!!
229,2017-07-30,[''],Beautiful covered trail along the way
230,2017-07-24,[''],"Great hike! took about 2 hours round trip at a good pace. we were lucky enough to find someone who told us to turn left once you hit the trailmarker sign! About 10 steps after you turn left, take another hard left to reach the base of the falls if you don't want to sit at the top. beautiful!"
231,2017-07-22,['hiking'],
232,2017-07-17,['hiking'],
233,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail. Although we tracked this to be a 5-6 mile hike round trip. Took about 3 hours.
Also, hiked this trail on 7/15 and there was a dead horse about 10 min up the trail. Smelled awful, had been there a while. I reported to animal services on 7/17. Very sad."
234,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"Great hike! The viewpoint of the waterfall is great, but hiking down into the waterfall is spectacular!"
235,2017-07-17,[''],"Confusing, no signs. 
Dead horse on side of trail had been their for some time, smelt horrible. Not for children under 12 in my opinion."
236,2017-07-15,['hiking'],"Short, steep and awesome!"
237,2017-07-10,['backpacking'],We did this as a day hike for the scouts to get ready for high adventure. Great hike. Beautiful views. Mostly shaded. Started around 6 PM and got back to the trailhead around 9:00 PM. Steady climb the whole way up. Would definitely do it again.
238,2017-07-03,['hiking'],Quick hike.  By myself it took an hour a half round trip.  First part is hot but after that it's mostly shaded.  Perfect for 6+.
239,2017-07-02,[''],"Great hike. Can get confusing finding the waterfall where everyone takes pictures. When you get to the top there is fork in the road with a sign. Take the left and few steps up there is ""trail"" that looks like a animal trail. Take that, someone put rope on a tree to help people get down it. Follow that for about 100m and there is the waterfall!"
240,2017-07-01,[''],Awesome hike. Plenty of tree cover which is great for summer days. Steep and rocky but completely doable. I'll definitely do this hike again.
241,2017-06-27,[''],"Fun hike, harder than expected, but the waterfall was pretty. We hiked up past it and it was really peaceful!"
242,2017-06-26,['hiking'],"Harder and hotter than expected. Felt more than 1800 ft elevation gain. Trail is a bit hard to find and to navigate near the falls. 5 miles round trip. But the determined will be amply rewarded by nice views, cool breezes, and the FORCE."
243,2017-06-26,['hiking'],"It's quite hot the first half of the hike so take more water than you think you need. The smallest guy in our group went through 1.5L before getting to the top. 
Constant large rocks in the trail so good ankle support is advised. 
The payoff at the top is a little tricky to get to but worth it."
244,2017-06-26,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! I hike weekly, work out regularly, and felt this was closer to a moderately rated hike. Definitely bring more water than normal since it's warmer and pretty steep throughout most of it. There was a small muddy section, but nothing crazy. This is a must-do hike and the it wasn't too crowded which was nice."
245,2017-06-26,['hiking'],"We are a family of 6 ranging in age from 6-48. It was a tough hike, lots of complaining by 6 and 16 yr old girls :) the two boys were like mountain goats racing upwards!We had a min of a liter of water each and an extra 2 liters. All the water was gone before we made it to the falls! It was hot. We started at 3pm last Friday and made it down by 7:20pm. If you are older or have sore knees or ankles I recommend poles to assist you as some of the going is loose rocks or so dry its slippy. Hiking shoes and socks a must. 
On saying all that, everyone was glad they did it. They really earned the most spectacular views. Highly recommend this trail. Hike all the way up until you see a wooden sign post. Deer creek dry creek. You can't miss it. A few steps after the post continuing upwards there is a rock - stop and slide down the slope. Hold onto branches for assistance- trail continues to the bottom of falls. Absolutely fantastic views. 

Don't forget sunscreen and hats! 
Again steep and difficult hike. Even the descent was not easy with the loose rubble. We would do it again."
246,2017-06-25,[''],"Amazing hike. Get up early before it gets hot and you'll have the whole trail to yourself until you start heading back down. Beautiful, peaceful and a good workout! Perfect way to start the day!"
247,2017-06-25,[''],"Did this hike with 4 kids ranging in age of 3-14, all of them did great!  There are no markers for getting off the trail to go to the waterfall. We would have gone a couple more miles on the trail had we not checked our trail map.  We cut off the trail near the top of the falls, sat on a grove of big boulders and had a snack overlooking the falls and valley.  Beautiful!  There were other hikers saying there was a rattlesnake but we didn't see or hear it.  Not too crowded.  We went on a Friday afternoon into early evening.  Great hike!"
248,2017-06-24,[''],super fun in all seasons. sledding down in the winter is a good time.
249,2017-06-21,[''],So beautiful and a fun hike.
250,2017-06-20,[''],"Gorgeous hike!  Uphill for most of the way up to the waterfall, but totally worth it!"
251,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Beautiful, pretty mellow and well-shaded.  Better as a ""forested"" hike rather than one with very dramatic views."
252,2017-06-17,['hiking'],Brutal hike to the top but well worth it. We reached the top around 4 after staring around 2 and had an amazing view of the valley and of the impressive waterfall. Best part almost no one was there when we reached the top! It's comparable to the view and falls of bells canyon without the popularity.
253,2017-06-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful, well worth the climb up there."
254,2017-06-13,[''],Such an amazing hike! We did walk right pass the turn to go to the bottom of the falls so we got lost for a few miles. I would say after you cross the river and before you get to the sign look to the left for a little trail. We passed it and did a huge loop. Beautiful falls! One of the best I've  seen in Utah!
255,2017-06-11,[''],"Went yesterday afternoon- still a little muddy and some snow but not much. The falls were beautiful. 
During my hike my car was broken into (window smashed) at the trailhead and a purse and wallet were stolen from the vehicle."
256,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"Fun trail with some great views. It was a little crowded at the trailhead with parking, but still very worth it. Be warned that this isn't an ""off the sofa to trail"" kind of hike"
257,2017-06-10,['hiking'],There is still a lot of water coming over the Falls so get up there soon. There is water coming down parts of the trail but you you can walk around these places. The trail to the Falls isn't marked. It you want to go the the base of the Falls take the left fork at the Deer Creek-Dry Creek sign. Then shortly after the fork look for a trail going down to the left. Otherwise you will end up at the overlook high above the falls like we did. This looks easier that scrambling down from the lookout. We started at 6:10am and had the trail to ourselves until we were on our way back down. Then the stream of people coming up started so if you want to skip the crowds start early
258,2017-06-10,[''],"Beautiful waterfall, but I wouldn't recommend it for young kids.  Once you get to the falls, be sure to hike down to the bottom!"
259,2017-06-08,[''],Steep hike but totally worth it! Amazing view of the valley.
260,2017-06-08,['hiking'],"Such a beautiful waterfall, you've really got to hike all the way to the falls, you can scramble down right to it... I got soaked!"
261,2017-05-31,['hiking'],"This hike while definitely not moderate was well worth the hike up there!! The trail is steep and rocky, but it is a gorgeous hike and that waterfall is magnificent and magical! Think I'm going to take my backpack and go camp up there!! Must do!"
262,2017-05-31,[''],Great shade throughout the trail. Nice meadows. Really fun hike. Steep but way cool.
263,2017-05-30,['hiking'],it really was a beautiful hike nut if this was moderate id hate to go an a hard hike. it tested us pretty good. nut really pretty. definitely enjoyed it!
264,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"Lovely day hike! The last turn into the waterfall is a steep little trail in which I witnessed people going down on their bottoms instead of trying to walk their way down. Well worth the hike, with the sun off the waterfall was very big and absolutely breathtaking!"
265,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"My GPS recorded 2.5   just to the lookout which is a far as we could push ourselves. THIS TRAIL IS STEEP. I'm still super sore from the workout. The entire path is covered in large rocks that tested our knees and ankles to the limit. 
Had we gone to the waterfall itself and back, we'd have recorded more than 5 miles with 2500+ft of elevation gain."
266,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"The falls are beautiful this time of the year! This was an intense hike, just be prepared for that. It's beautiful though!"
267,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"One of the most beautiful waterfall I've been too. The hike has a bit of an incline when you start, then it gives the incline comes and goes. After about two miles in when you see the wooden post that says something about deer creek or so, there will be a little path on your left (which looks a little sketchy) that path will take you to the bottom of the waterfall. If you want to get to the top then you can keep going on the path. Personally, viewing from the bottom it way worth it."
268,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"This hike is spectacular, I love the meadow on the way up. My dog loves this trail, but watch for people riding horses. The scenery and smells of the mountain are good on this hike, if that's what you're looking for. The river and the waterfall are very pretty."
269,2017-05-28,[''],Beautiful trail with pines. Quite steep with very spotty shade. Best if you are in fairly good shape to handle hiking steep trails for 2 + miles then down. Getting close to the waterfall requires going down quite steep terrain. Good hiking shoes with tread are helpful.
270,2017-05-28,[''],"Steeper than I thought for moderate, but still a great hike"
271,2017-05-28,[''],The waterfall is worth the walk to the top
272,2017-05-27,[''],"Such a beautiful hike. Its certainly challenging,  but the trail seemed to even out right when it was needed most."
273,2017-05-27,['hiking'],"Very pretty hike! Obviously it differs with experience and personal fitness, but for me, this hike should be ""hard"". I tend to go on ""moderate"" hikes from AllTrails and although they're challenging, they are very doable and I can usually go without any breaks. This trail had me huffing and puffing the entire way and I had to take constant breaks. It is is very very steep the whole way up. Very rocky terrain and you have to cross some creeks so be prepared to get your shoes a little muddy. We are beginner hikers so we took our time getting up to the falls, however the scenery was fanstastic. We had a hard time finding the falls and got a bit lost so here is how you get to a beautiful overlook that gives you a great spot to enjoy the falls:
There is only one mile marker towards the end of the hike Both arrows point to the right for another trail. You want to go left. Keep going up for about 5-10 min, and you will come up to a steep downhill trail on your left. Slide down that small trail and keep going for another 10 minutes. You will cross various small streams and eventually get to the falls. 
We are both beginners so this trial was definitely ""hard"" for us. So if you're not very expereinced, keep that in mind and give yourself the time to get there. The falls at the end are fantastic and worth the challenge."
274,2017-05-21,['hiking'],"Absolutely love this trail, we found a little break off from the main trail about .5 miles from the actual waterfall that overlooked it. It was absolutely gorgeous, we went on a rainy day and it ended up hailing on us, but it was so worth it!"
275,2017-05-21,[''],"Loved this hike. How Bells Canyon is rated hard and this is rated Moderate, however, I don't get.  Found this to be a very similar hike, but honestly liked this one so much more. Steady, challenging climb the whole way. We got a bit lost and had to back track. A nice hiker showed us where we went wrong and got us over to the falls. We ended up at the top and then hiked down to the base...and scrambled right down to them where we fou nd a place to sit and eat a snack.  For a while we were all alone there...it was the best. Love this hike. Recommend highly.  Our GPS showed 5.51 miles when we finished. I think the 4 miles shown here is inaccurate."
276,2017-05-16,[''],it was a tough trail fore but I am pretty much a beginner. I enjoyed it but I'm a slow hiker.
277,2017-05-08,['hiking'],This trail was a really nice mix between shade and sun. It was somewhat difficult to find our way to the waterfall but it was beautiful and well worth the hike.
278,2017-05-07,[''],"Awesome hike!  Uphill for most of the way to the falls.  Beautiful wildflowers and scenery along the way.  It takes a bit of bush wacking to get to the bottom of the falls, but so worth it!  There wasn't any snow, but a few muddy spots on the trail."
279,2017-05-07,['hiking'],Best time to see the waterfall! It's spewing right now. There is a trail to the top and a more hidden trail to the lower half of the waterfall. Go see both! 10/10 recommend.
280,2017-05-01,['hiking'],Amazing views!!!
281,2017-05-01,['hiking'],"Easily and quickly became one of my favorite trails. I lollygagged for hours longer than required on this trail, simply taking in the landscape."
282,2017-04-23,['hiking'],"Beautiful area. I ended up above the waterfall and I can't describe how amazing the view was. It's a good climb up to the waterfall, but well worth it. There were a couple times that I had to cross a small stream, but very easy to stay dry if you want to."
283,2017-04-19,[''],Fun trail with my dog. Uphill most of the way but great view of the falls and valley
284,2017-04-19,['hiking'],"Steep climb on moderately rocky terrain, but a great view and a beautiful waterfall running strong this time of year."
285,2017-04-17,[''],"Took the kiddos (12, 9, and 7), but wouldn't recommend taking kids younger than ours, it was definitely tough for them. Would recommend hiking either early morning or evening do to shade shortage. Beautiful falls."
286,2017-04-14,['hiking'],"Beautiful day for hiking to the falls.  Trail has a fair amount of loose rocks but not too hard to hike.  Muddy in spots due to snow melt but very minimal amount of snow on the trail and spikes are not needed.  Falls had abundant amount of water.  Trail to the top of falls not easy to spot, veers off left around 1 3/4 miles from the TH.  Lots of morning shade so a good hike to do early in the day in the summer.  Trail map is slightly incorrect about 1 1/4 miles in where it turns right at the meadow.  Trail continues straight ahead and eventually meets up with what is shown on the map."
287,2017-04-05,['trail running'],"As stated below, the trail is 95% clear. A few small patches of snow and mud. Be mindful not to lose the trail while approaching the falls. If you undershoot it you're going to be bushwhacking, if you overshoot you're going up and around. Apparently there's a way to cross the river directly below the fall and make this trail a loop."
288,2017-04-04,['trail running'],"The trail is 95% clear. There are a few small patches of packed snow (easy to cross) and a few small patches of mud/runoff from recently melted snow, but otherwise the trail up to the falls is in great shape."
289,2017-03-13,['hiking'],"We took the kids (6, 4, and 2) we made our way to the top of the falls but I am pretty sure we missed the turn that would have led us to the bottom of the falls. It was a beautiful hike, with amazing views. The snow is still very abundant on the trail. We plan on going again a little later in Spring and trying to find the trail that leads to the bottom of the falls."
290,2017-02-19,['hiking'],Trail is snow packed still at upper elevations but melting fast. Skiers and sledders have made the trail ice so appropriate footwear is required as the trail is steep. Traffic was moderate on cool Saturday afternoon. The waterfall is inaccessible without snowshoes. It can be seen from the trail in multiple locations but the snow off the trail is melting and deep.
291,2017-01-08,[''],"Easy 
BEAT"
292,2016-11-14,['hiking'],"I would rate this as a moderate hike, we found the waterfall and had to climb down, but we made it. We didn't go much farther after that. My dog did fine."
293,2016-10-22,['hiking'],"Honestly a lot more difficult and longer than expected, being short on time we were unable to finish. However, hiking back down was absolutely gorgeous and loved seeing all the horses :)"
294,2016-10-17,['trail running'],"Good out and back. Pretty steep for a jog, but do-able. I saw horses and families, so the definition of moderate is good, but I would lean on the harder side only because there really aren't any switchbacks to keep it an easy steady climb. Massive rocks on the path- not great for off-road strollers"
295,2016-10-03,['hiking'],Was a good hike with a good view to the falls. There isn't a clear and defined trail to the actual falls and I overshot it. I had to do some bush whacking. My dog wasn't too happy about me carrying her while scrambling over some granite.
296,2016-10-03,[''],"ok. read the reviews before hiking this trail if getting to the waterfall is important to you. It is confusing and tough to find. If you just want a great hike in beautiful scenery then don't worry about it and go have fun but finding the waterfall is tough. 

Of note, it's rated ""moderate""... maybe but it is on the hard side of moderate. and it is way longer than 3.5 miles round trip. According to the pedometer we went more like 6 total. 

That said, we had a blast and we are very excited to discover this awesome trail close to home."
297,2016-09-18,[''],"Beautiful fall hike and not very crowded at least compared to the Cottonwood Canyons at this time of the year. Can be confusing to get to the falls. 

The map that they show on All trails takes you to the Falls look out. This can be found by taking a trail off the main trail to the left and you will quickly come to a slab of granite that you can sit and look out at the falls in the distance. To get to the lower part of the falls, you continue on the trail until you come to a sign that does not mention the falls. You want to continue to the LEFT of the sign and about 35 to 45 steps past the sign on your left you will see a trail. The trail has a quick drop so it doesn't seem like it is an actual trail but if you continue down you will see a trail and it will take you to the base of the falls. There could be some climbing down to the water once you get there so if you have children you want to keep an eye on them. If you want to go to the top of the falls, bypass this trail and continue up the main trail.  This is a little bit more difficult to find. You will need to look for a big rock on your left-hand side and somebody has stacked some rocks to designate the entrance. You will then need to climb up the rock and over and you will see a trail and follow it. You will know that you have the right place if you continue you will see what I would call a table style Rock formation in front of you. A little tunnel so to speak. Again you need to be careful in this area while climbing around.

We actually missed all of these markers and continued up the trail. The trail from here on up is pretty steep and rocky but it ends in a nice flat area which was very pretty and has beautiful views. At this point we were pretty tired and it made for a great place to take a break so it was not much of a waste. If you are confused don't hesitate to ask people on the trail where to go. There are no official markings for this trail.

You can bring your dog on this trail but I am unsure about the leash rule. All trail says dogs must be on leash but an article in the local paper designated this as an off leash area. I would carry your leash regardless and make sure you pick up your dog crap. All in all it made for a great hike on a beautiful fall day."
298,2016-09-04,[''],"Trail is definitely longer than 1.2 miles; I'd say closer to 4.5 round trip (2 plus some each way). Trail is not too difficult but is definitely steep. 
FINDING THE WATERFALL was tricky for us- after you pass the pirate flag keep going until you hit a sign for deer Creek trail and keep left after the sign. Then when you hit some slabs of rock and you can either climb what sort of looks like a trail up the slab of rock or continue going on the dirt path, that is when you start climbing the rock! You will see the waterfall soon after that. If you say on the dirt trail to the right it begins to get incredibly steep and you  will keep heading up the mountain toward the summit. There's more brush and trees back there and it will be clear you've left the waterfall behind. This mistake took at least a mile past the falls before we decided we definitely were too far from the falls and turned back. Waterfall is awesome and there are pools you can play in."
299,2016-08-27,['hiking'],"Took our two mountain dogs with us. Very nice hike, mostly in the shade of the trees. Good luck finding the falls - It's waayy past 1.3 miles, more like 3.75 - we ended up going off trail to get to it. Maybe we missed the right path, who knows?"
300,2016-08-24,['hiking'],Its a nice trail once you get to the wooded part of the trail. The beginning on hot days could be quite hot. once you get to the woods though its beautiful and has a good incline your looking for a work out.
301,2016-08-24,['hiking'],Gorgeous hike uphill the whole way but definitely not hard.  It is longer than 1.3 miles though my GPS said 2.02 and we hiked to the top of the falls.  So out and back it was 4 miles.  Crisp and cool at the end of August.
302,2016-08-16,[''],Great hike.  Steady uphill trail makes for some hard work...but well worth it.
303,2016-08-15,['hiking'],do not trust this hike. it is a scam. my limp friend joined me thinking it was an easy 1.3 mile out and back hike. little did she know it was twice as long then the Internet says. we ended up turning around.  very disappointing.
304,2016-08-05,['hiking'],"Decent incline grade the whole way up, it's about 4.5mile round trip, down takes maybe 25 min at a gentle jog. The best way to get to the falls is basically keep left all the way. At the sign post, keep left again, then about 30 yards up on the left, there are a pile/tower of stones/rocks take a left and head up the boulders here and it will take you to the falls. Overall good hike, if you turn right at the sign post the trail goes on forever! Hike for a different day :)"
305,2016-08-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful upper falls above horsetail falls in Alpine, Utah! We came upon the upper falls 2.9 miles up from the trailhead and it was spectacular and
Completely unexpected. Took the wrong trail to the lower horsetail falls on our way down the mountain and ran out of time. Will definitely come back and check it out!"
306,2016-07-31,[''],"This hike is so much longer than 1.3 miles. I think it ended up being 7.3 miles round trip for us but we went a little too far. We took the trail all the way up from the parking lot and it was really hard to find. You come to a sign that points both ways to the right. We went left and found a tiny path to the falls. Very hard too. Uphill the whole way up. Beautiful though! Recommend going earlier in the summer months, it gets really hot."
307,2016-07-24,[''],"Great trail, multiple ways to get to the falls, some more shady than others."
308,2016-07-24,[''],"took this trail all the way to the waterfall. it's about a 3 mile hike in. Way longer than it shows on all trails app, but totally worth it. good trail had a great time."
309,2016-07-23,['walking'],"The trail marked here is not the trail to take if you want to be close to the waterfall. We took 6 kids on this hike thinking that we'd be close to water. The trail marked here takes you no where near the water. You cross a small stream about 3-4 times, we hiked 2 miles up the trail, and only got to an overlook, not anywhere close to the waterfall. To get to anything close to the creek, take a trail that crosses the creek and gets to on the left side of the creek.  If you are on the right side, you are on the wrong side."
310,2016-07-21,['hiking'],"It was a fun hike, listing to the water all the way up was nice."
311,2016-07-20,[''],great hike!
312,2016-07-20,['hiking'],I have done this trail many times. It's a steady and tough uphill climb with little respite until you reach the falls. It's shady most of the way in dense forest. You can hear the stream running the whole way up and you cross it several times. The stream flows really hard early Spring and care is needed at some crossings. This hike is a great workout with a nice scenic reward at the top. Highly recommended.
313,2016-07-19,['hiking'],"Fun hike, but AllTrails has the distance wrong. According to my app the hike was 4.73 miles from the parking lot to the base of the waterfall and back and 1620 ft of elevation gain.

Hike is nice and shady most of the way, but steep. Great views of the valley when you get to the top and the falls are fantastic. Also dog friendly!"
314,2016-07-07,['hiking'],"It is actually 6.5 miles round trip! (And I started exactly where this app led me). Maybe there is different trail heads...like all hikes. But Amazing hike, great workout!"
315,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"It is definitely longer than 1.3 miles round trip, although I didn't track the mileage I would say 2-3 miles round trip. Also, I wouldn't say this is a ""hard"" hike. It's a steady uphill the entire way, but not ""hard"". I would say moderate. Hands down one of the BEST and most powerful waterfalls."
316,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Excellent hike! It was more than the 1.3 miles round trip. We hiked up to the falls and I'd say it was at least four miles out and back. The trail is well shaded and goes along the creek. The trail was uphill the entire way to the falls. When we got to the falls, we were at the right side near the top. We found a little path that went down to the base of the falls and that is where you wanna be. Feeling the cool mist of the falls on a hot summer day was incredible. The way back down was quick. Not as many people on this trail, which is nice."
317,2016-06-27,[''],"Great trail. Gets skittle confusing toward the end, but other then that, one of my favorite trails! Great ROI!"
318,2016-06-26,['hiking'],Hiked all the way to the falls. The trail that takes you there isn't well marked. It was very rocky and steep. Overall not a bad hike.
319,2016-06-26,['hiking'],Steady climb up. Low traffic. Love the falls at the end.
320,2016-06-23,['hiking'],"Great hike. Steep the whole way- not very many points that it levels out to give you a break. Actually closer to 2.5 miles as others have said to get all the way up and back to the waterfall. The last mile or so just gets steeper, but it's worth it for the view and falls. Will go again for sure."
321,2016-06-20,['hiking'],"This hike was wonderful! While there is a steady incline I am surprised that this was labeled as ""difficult"". 

Will do again!"
322,2016-06-14,['hiking'],"Nice trail, we hiked packing in our two kids up to the lookouts before the falls. It has nice coverage so it's not too terribly hot. It is definitely steep, I probably wouldn't classify it as difficult if you stop before you reach the falls though. We took our 11 week old puppy and he was still running when we got down."
323,2016-06-05,[''],This was a good hike with the family. Don't be shy with your water supply
324,2016-06-04,['hiking'],The hike is about 4 to 5 miles . Depends if you go all the way to the top. I would rate this more like a difficult hike and not very kid friendly because of how steep it is. The outcome it is wonderful and we made it to the top where the waterfall starts I would do it again but maybe in like a month or two not something I would do weekly.
325,2016-06-02,['hiking'],"First off, this hike is over 4 miles round trip. Enjoyed this hike, very steady incline the entire way. Gets steeper the higher you go and there are some challenging spots especially if you go up above the falls to the pools. Coming down can be hard on the knees ( I have very bad knees) and I felt it. We went on a Saturday and there were a lot of people on the trail, fortunately the trail is pretty wide in a lot of places. Fun to cross over some of the streams. Good hike."
326,2016-05-31,['walking'],Great hike all uphill. Beautiful falls. We went late spring. My wife and I are avid hikers and runners we made the trip in 1 hr and 50 min.
327,2016-05-31,[''],Okay hike but great ending. You will have to cross a creek either on a log or get your feet wet.
328,2016-05-29,['hiking'],Awesome!  My favorite hike.  It's more like 2.5 miles to the falls.
329,2016-05-27,[''],"This hike was awesome. Pretty rough at times and it's extremely easy to lose the trail once you get to the waterfall. This hike was definitely not 1.3 miles. It was 3.4 one way. Pretty steep inclines, walking through quite a bit of streams and water."
330,2016-05-26,[''],"So fun!! Pretty wet still, but so worth it!"
331,2016-05-21,['cross country skiing'],"I've done the hike three times now. I really enjoy it. It's not the most scenic hike up because it's mostly covered but the trees and a couple of the meadows are beautiful. I've actually slipped into the falls also which was a little scary just because it was cold and night time, but it was shallow enough for me to climb out quickly. I would recommend this hike, although if you take someone that doesn't like hiking they will complain about the incline."
332,2016-05-19,[''],"Gorgeous!  Moderate uphill but the best is hearing the thunderous creek as you hike, best sound ever.  Love nature.  Shaded and fresh spring smells."
333,2016-05-11,['hiking'],"I’d heard a lot about Horsetail Falls from a coworker of mine. Beautiful views, pretty easy hike. I attempted to get my fiance' to join me long ago, but after reading the reviews on AllTrails, she got scared off by the mediocre hikers complaining of a steep trail and scary drops. (not a thing, by the way. There are hikes that are way steeper than this in the area, though I will concede that this hike is relentless). 

Finally, a friend that is home from Southern Utah for the summer said he’d be down for the hike and we headed toward the hills. 

The trailhead begins on the bench of Alpine, a city in Northern Utah County. We arrived to a parking lot full of Mormon haulers and I suspected correctly when I deducted that because of the day of the week (Wednesday), that there were youth groups from the local LDS congregation making the sojourn. 

The beginning of the hike is a nice incline that doesn't let up for most of the duration albeit a small flat section that meanders through a meadow.  The trail is rocky, and I remember thinking that for as wide as the trail was, it could sure use a grading job. But, I don’t mind that it was in it’s rougher form either, because I really don’t like trails that follow roads and I felt that the amount of natural obstruction allowed for the hike to be more adventurous. I just wouldn't wear flip-flops on the hike, that's for sure. 

The hike up was spent exchanging pleasantries with my friend that I hadn't seen in a long time and the conversation slowly got deeper as we plunged deeper into the forest, leaving the valley and its noise behind. We talked mission stories and lessons learned, and made silent goals for the future as we allowed the healing powers that exist in nature to purge our minds of the filth of the week and restore anew. 

Reaching a lookout where you could see the falls, the more adventurous side of me screamed that I must push further to reach the top of the falls. So, on we went crossing small streams that plunged down small waterfalls and miniscule riverbeds down out of the mouth of the small canyon we were rimming. The trail kept going, but the light got more and more diminished. Having not traversed the trail before, we decided it best to play on the side of caution and move back toward the valley once more, descending the rocky trail for our descent to the ever faithful Camry for a trip to a local Frozen Yogurt eatery."
334,2016-05-02,[''],It is a longer hike.  close to 6 miles out and back from Dry Creek Trailhead.   the waterfall is magnificent and the views are amazing once u reach the top.   i highly recommend it.
335,2016-05-01,['hiking'],"The falls are incredible, this hike should be on everyone's list. It's a steady climb the whole way but not insanely steep it's just that there are really no breaks to the climb. I know everyone is all over the place in the mileage but I clocked it at almost exactly 6 miles round trip to the base of the falls. The trail was well marked except we had to veer off and fallow the ribbons to get to the base of the falls which I would highly recommend. There was no snow on the trail at this time but it is a little muddy still."
336,2016-04-20,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite hikes! It's fairly steep so that makes it a harder hike, I wouldn't say it's a hard on the difficulty but it's a bit tougher than a medium hike.  the app is wrong though, hike is closer to 4.2 miles round.  it's very easy to find the falls, there is a very clear trail the entire way up!  they say dog on a leash but every time I have ever been, I've never seen even one dog on a leash which I like. definitely a great hike to go on!"
337,2016-03-21,['hiking'],Snow covered the last third of the trail. Fairly steep climb. Hike is definitely longer then 1.3 miles. Closer to 4 miles round trip.
338,2016-03-20,[''],Made it to the meadow. Did not make it to the falls. Had a fun time. It is pretty steep on the way up.
339,2016-03-20,['hiking'],"Amazing! However why it says 1.3 miles...I dunno. It's 6.4 miles round trip. Beautiful though, and worth the hike!"
340,2016-03-05,[''],Awesome trail!
341,2016-03-05,[''],Loved it
342,2015-10-01,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite hikes in Utah County. The trail is consistently steep, but easy to follow. It isn't an easy hike, physically, but not overly strenuous either. My husband and I were able to carry on a conversation throughout most of it. There is quite a bit of shade, and you go through areas of forest as well as a gorgeous meadow. There are sections of the trail that are loose rock that require you to pay a little extra attention to footing, especially going downhill. There are also several small stream crossings. You will be able to hear the falls for the majority of your hike, but won't actually see them until the end. When you get to the granite, go back to the trail. Once you get to a fork in the trail (I believe there is a sign there, but don't recall exactly what it says) stay to the LEFT. Then look for the first game trail on your left. There are usually ribbons tied to the trees to mark the spot. The game trail is steep and requires careful footing, but it will take you right to the base of the falls. When the falls came in to view for the first time I was just speechless. They are breathtaking. The rocks are slippery and some areas are steep, so please be careful!"
343,2015-09-27,[''],"Went with my beagle early one morning started around 8 and finished around noon. Jump on line and look up the trail, it will tell you how to get closer to the falls without falling (or rolling) down the mountain. Once you get to the granite over look go back to the real trail until you hit the fork in the road then go left and jump on the first game trail you see, it'll take you over to the falls. 

We were able to touch the water fall, but it's really slippery so please be careful and don't go alone. There is even a memorial down by the waterfall of an unfortunate fall victim. 

If your doggies like to roll in horse poop, be prepared to wash them down. Cause there is a lot of it. 

Will definitely do it again."
344,2015-09-20,['hiking'],"This hike was challenging for our family with 2 teens. Hiking up a rocky very steep creek bed, and had to make several stops to adjust to elevation changes. Had to watch every step and not much shade along the trail. We were disappointed to see how far away the falls were, as we expected to see them close enough to enjoy. All in all, not our favorite but did make for a good workout!"
345,2015-08-30,[''],Steep and shifty under foot. Great waterfall with an amazing view that is second to none for a shorter hike.
346,2015-08-25,[''],"Great for a shaded trail and relaxing by the falls at the end. The trail is mostly a dry creek bed so lots of navigating over river rock...and horse poo. Seriously...why isn't there some method for managing this. Anyway, there is a beautiful overlook not to be missed (just a bit up past the meadow).  Back on the main trail, I missed the final turn to the falls--watch for the trail markers and then some scrambling down to the falls. There are orange ties on bushes to help you in and back out. Overall a beautiful hike."
347,2015-08-02,[''],Uhmmmm if this was easy what is a difficult hike like?!?  So many rocks and really steep.
348,2015-07-30,[''],"Beautiful falls, but the trail to get to the base is not clearly marked and is a steep scramble."
349,2015-07-27,[''],It was a steady up hill hike.
350,2015-06-07,['hiking'],"this hike was over 5 miles from beginning to end.  it was extremely rocky and steep.  creek crossing is necessary.  the waterfall is difficult to find, as the trails are poorly marked.  was told by fellow hikers that the trail used to be better maintained.  right now the trail is really bad.  i don't recommend this hike unless you are in fantastic shape."
351,2015-06-02,[''],"Great day hike, beautiful meadow, go on a weekday to avoid crowds."
352,2015-05-31,['hiking'],"The hike is about 4 or so miles,it's not hard but the trail is very rocky and muddy especially if done before June. I enjoyed the view of the mountains and more so the water fall. It took us around 3 hours but I think it could take less time depending on one's pace."
353,2015-05-30,[''],"Took my 6 year old on his first ""backpacking"" trip on this hike. We hiked to the meadow set up camp, then headed up to the waterfall the next morning. Great beginner hike, plenty of shade, lots of easily accessible water to filter (especially near the meadow). Plenty of shade throughout the entire hike. 

The only downside is that the trail is very busy, especially on the weekend. We went up Thursday and came back Friday and only saw a few people on Thursday and saw a lot more groups on Friday. Fun hike!"
354,2015-05-30,[''],Beautifully magnificent
355,2015-05-30,['hiking'],This was an awesome hike! Did this with my best friend and it took us about 3 and a half hours to go out and back but it was an amazing hike!
356,2015-05-12,['hiking'],Thought this would be a good trail to run.  Only on the way down it is steep and you feel the elevation for sure.  Great hike and great waterfall.
357,2015-04-20,['hiking'],Great adventure! Lots of uphill and lots of rocks! Great sights and plenty of wildlife along the trail. My wife and I are planning our return visit to do an overnighter up there! 
358,2015-03-29,['hiking'],"While I've been up to the falls in past hikes, today I hiked up to the meadow.  The trail is dry for the most part and had sparse patches of snow by the meadow, but overall in great condition for this time of year.  It's  a fairly rugged trail most of the way to the falls and moderately steep in parts.  Lots of tree cover through pines as you near the meadow.  The falls are spectacular too.  One of my favorite hikes in the alpine/highland area."
359,2014-07-11,['hiking'],"This trail is awesome. It is steep in some parts and seems a little long but so worth it. The waterfall itself is beautiful. 
Hike Rate: Medium- Hard 
Length: 1-2:30 hrs
Trail traffic: none"
360,2014-06-17,['hiking'],This is a gorgeous hike however there is construction at the beginning which makes it hard to figure out which way to go. The turn off to the falls isn't marked so I went up past the falls. Meet 2 girls who took the other path at the beginning which ran the other side of river. We finally found the spectacular falls approx 4 miles round trip. Lots of horse poop on the trail :)
361,2014-06-07,[''],This hike was pretty heavy I am in ok shape and I struggled but when you finally get to the waterfall about 1-1.5 hours it is absolutely unbelievable and you will not regret making your way to the waterfall! A moose or elk scared me away the first time but ran into nothing the second time around. Is a pretty high elevation gain fast!
362,2014-04-21,['hiking'],It's a great little hike! Lots of fun great thing to do on a Saturday morning with your family or group of friends! The falls are beautiful. Go! You won't regret it.
363,2013-08-02,['hiking'],Nice on a summer evening... Good canopy for most of the trip. Spotted a few deer and a decent sized snake.
364,2013-07-30,['hiking'],"Wide trail (lots of water in it in early spring), with very rocky and technical stepping in places. Fairly steep at times, but I wouldn't call it relentlessly uphill by any means. The falls are absolutely spectacular, and worth every step it took to arrive there. Be sure to look for a steep trail (down) about 1.9 miles up that looks like water runoff or a game path, that's the one that takes you to the bottom of the falls, the main trail will take you to the top. Do both! This hike has awesome views of Alpine, as well as Lone, Big Horn and Box Elder Peaks!"
365,2013-04-28,['hiking'],Good hike... Rocky trail... Path to the falls is not well marked.
