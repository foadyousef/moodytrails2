0,2019-09-05,['hiking'],"Great little-big hike. It's only 1.3 miles to the top but it's a good vertical gain of 1341 ft. 
Trail is well maintained and in great shape (wish I could say the same about my own conditions) :P"
1,2019-09-03,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
2,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'no shade']",No shade but it’s a nice view and a cool pic with the American Flag. 
3,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"My 5 yr old was with me, so we didn’t get far."
4,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'no shade']","Interesting hike to see Patsy's mine, although it's about the only shade you'll get on the hike. The dirt is loose towards the top so it can be slow going. Great views at the top though."
5,2019-07-05,['hiking'],Great place to watch the fireworks in Davis County. Hiked up in just under an hour leaving at 8:30. Watched fired works for a half hour. Came back with headlamps. Perfect evening. 
6,2019-07-01,['hiking'],"I loved it.  Find a cloudy day because it’s about 3% shaded.  It is steep, you get a break on the fire road, and about 2/3 up but other than that your climbing.  The mine is only about 100ft past the marker where the trail splits.  Worth seeing.  You can see the pay off from the start of the trail and it looks pretty crazy, but it’s comparable to most moderate trails I have done.   Also I was at about 3.1 mile round trip.  "
7,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"I feel like it was a bit tougher than the app led to believe. I was huffing and I workout and do cardio 6 days a week. Well worth it though, because the view at the top is magnificent. You gain altitude pretty rapidly, so you have a good view of the valley most of the way up. We hiked it at sunset, which I would recommend not only for the view, but also because the temperature isn't as high and you are not hit with the midday sun on the way up. "
8,2019-06-26,['hiking'],"I will go on with the bad parts of this trail!

 It was a harder trail in my opinion, the trail is steep and washed out in parts! also the trail is loose so be careful going down! I couldn't finish it because I was way to tired going up! kinda says I need to get back in shape lol

The good parts of the trail!

 There is alot of wildlife with cute lizzards, birds and dragonflies! sparse purple flowers and just pretty in general! if it wasn't so steep and my knees weren't jello I would go all the way!"
9,2019-06-23,[''],We took 8 kids with us ages 8-14 and they did amazing! I was huffing and puffing as the trail is a good climb almost the entire way up. The view at the top is a nice reward for all of the effort. I would not recommend going on a hot day at all. Also we did see one rattler on the trail so keep your eyes peeled if you go. 
10,2019-06-18,['hiking'],"Great hike! The trail head is a bit hard to find at first, it’s behind a brown sign in a cul de sac. Pretty moderate hike but in the sun, it gets a bit hard towards the top."
11,2019-06-08,['hiking'],Great quick hike with great views
12,2019-06-03,"['hiking', 'no shade']","The trail head is right by the sign in the cul-de-sac. No trees the whole trail is in the sun, go for sunrise or sunset. Pretty view & easy hike."
13,2019-05-14,['hiking'],Went on this trail and I really enjoyed it. It is really good for getting a leg workout in because it is up hill the entire way. Our legs were burning but our party had someone who has never completed a hike before and he was able to do it and he’s not an active individual. THIS HIKE FEELS SO REWARDING. It is definitely a challenge but the reward is so good the view is amazing and the daunting task of making it to the top seems like a huge accomplishment once achieved.
14,2019-05-14,['hiking'],"There is absolutely no trail head, my friend and I took the wrong trail and ended up hiking triple the amount we were supposed to."
15,2019-05-09,['hiking'],"Went on May 9th. Relaxing trail, it's worth checking out the mine (short detour if you're going straight down the hill) Heads up: if you go on a day where the wind is blowing out of the north or south, you'll get some cool photos with the flag sprawled out. Happy exploring! <3 "
16,2019-04-15,['hiking'],"I keep on finding more and more trails popping up that I have completed.  I think the other one to here might have been a loop trip.  No matter I am going to mark this as a complete.  I usually come here on Sept 11 every year with a group of Geocachers.  The flag here sits at the same height the towers were in NYC.  We start at the fire station down the road and make the hike.  The trail master usually will put up a new flag prior to the event.  Great Hike, Great Spot.  I would recommend the loop trip as well."
17,2019-04-07,[''],"Saw this on another site and took my kids which ended up being much harder than anticipated. (Kids were 9, 7, 4 and 18 months in a backpack). It would have been a workout without a kid in a backpack. My kids loved the mine once we made it, but probably won't do it again until they're older. Didn't go all the way up to the flag. We still joke about Patsy's mine saying, 'Come on, this hike is no  Patsy's mine' when we're trying to motivate our kids on easier hikes."
18,2019-04-06,['hiking'],"challenging if you don’t hike a lot. Pretty steep and narrow, but definitely beautiful."

21,2018-12-18,['hiking'],"My husband and I completed this hike on December 15.  

Initially, We planned on doing a canyon hike that morning, but were thwarted due to a the road being inaccessible.  So we scrambled to find another hike in the area, and ended up doing Flag Rock!  

This hike is steep and narrow much of the way.... definitely not ideal for young children.  So steep and strenuous, in fact, that we stopped several times to take off layers of clothes!  

The trail was a mix of snow and mud, so we were glad we had our snow cleats.  You could probably make it with some sturdy boots, but the cleats really helped us grip on the steep uphill portions.  

From the top, the views of the valley are predictable but decent if you're into cityscape views .  It's definitely nice to have a destination to hike to. There is a nice bench at the top to take a rest.  

We'd recommend this hike for anyone looking for a decent workout!"
22,2018-10-22,['hiking'],"It was a good hike, beautiful. The trail head is hard to spot, but here’s a tip: it is right where the map leads you. It’s off to the side of a big brown sign, there is a faint trail. I started the hike at 6:00 pm after school one day. I’m 16, in high school, and I did the hike alone. I simply hiked, didn’t jog, and reached the top at 6:40 pm. It was very steep for the first half, probably a 40 degree incline. It was beautiful at sunset though, absolutely amazing. Will most likely do again with friends. Only tips I would give is stretch your calves before you start because it’s a killer. The trail is a little roughly marked for the first little bit, but just follow the signs. Four stars because of how rough and i kept it was. But great."
23,2018-09-07,['hiking'],"Fun trail (once you find it). The hike is quite challenging, due to the length of steep upward hiking. The footing is not technical our difficult, just the steepness of the hike. If you like the feeling of hiking straight up a steep Mountain, you will love this hike."
24,2018-08-27,['hiking'],"Great hike to a couple of neat sites, it's exposed the entire way but the mine is perfect place to explore & cool off before heading on up to the flag. It is fairly steep in a few spots but it's not really long so very manageable."
25,2018-08-24,[''],"Went on this hike last weekend. I went up a different trail for about a mile that met up with this trail. the mine goes quite far until it splits off into two and that's where I stopped. it wasn't too far from the mine to flag rock, but a decent vertical. It's a great relatively small hike and I recommend!"
26,2018-08-22,[''],"Great early morning hike. You can see your target so that was motivating. The mine was a little damp, beware of low clearances if you’re tall. Lots of fun. The trail head is right under the light post and parking is across from it. Happy Hiking !"
27,2018-08-10,[''],I only give it three stars because the mine was fun for the kids to explore. Very steep loose dirt trails so very slippery. I made the mistake of going with my three young children and dog alone so that made it all the more challenging but even then I can’t imagine this trail being enjoyable without children. The mine is really cool. Bring flashlights or full charged cell phone lights. Really no shade on trail. Mine is nice and cool though.
28,2018-07-08,['hiking'],"We hiked this starting around 6:15pm.  The trail is not clearly marked for some time.  We found ourselves “stumbling” onto the trail.  My GPS said that it was around 1.5 miles up, 1.6 down.  We did not go to the mine.    Took us around 2 hours to get to the flag (it was super hot, and we were slightly creeped out thinking we kept hearing rattlesnakes...although we never saw one)  we took multiple breaks and sat at a bench 1/2 way through the hike.  We spent a good amount of time up top, watching the sun set "
29,2018-07-02,['hiking'],Great well maintained trail! Pretty the entire way through!
30,2018-07-01,[''],"It was a bit rough for my out of shape family but it was a great view and I loved the mine.  I’m a bit scared of heights and the narrow steep trail had me a bit anxious, especially on the way down. However I didn’t have too much trouble and I’m looking forward to seeing more of Utah"
31,2018-06-20,['hiking'],"Great views of the valley and the Great Salt Lake. A good trail for the entire family. If you like mines, Patsy’s is an easy walk into."
32,2018-06-17,['hiking'],"This was a super fun hike because of the old mine at the end.  Before you go, Google the history of the mine, then you will have the back story as you search the tunnels.  Bring a flashlight!"
33,2018-05-30,['hiking'],"Super fun but very steep. The kids made it ages 3,6,7 but it was difficult. Worth the hike. Round trip- 3/12 hrs."
34,2018-05-29,[''],"Nice hike for Memorial Day. Loved being up at Flag Rock to see the view and ponder what so many have sacrificed for us. Fairly easy trail, but definitely exposed. Luckily it was only in the 60s. The mine was cool and definitely required a light to explore."
35,2018-05-28,['hiking'],"Beautiful morning for a hike. The views are spectacular the farther up you go. Well kept trails although a little narrow at times, especially if someone is passing by. There were a lot of families with children and they were all doing well. Patsy’s Mine was a fun little spot off the trail on our way to Flag Rock. I recommend starting early in the day as the heat of summer could make it too difficult."
36,2018-05-17,[''],"Went with some friends and it was AMAZING, it is pretty steep and some people in our group with asthma had some trouble with is but the flag and the view were awesome and coming down to the mine was gorgeous. Put it on your list of hikes to do!!!"
37,2018-05-17,['hiking'],Great hike. Wish the trails were marked somewhat closer to bottom of trail. There are markers the farther up you go.
38,2018-05-06,['trail running'],"Rattlers are out and about, be careful! The one we saw today was just off the trail about halfway up, coiled in the grass, and aggressive! It was about 3 inches around, rattler was about an inch and a half long. Higher pitched rattle that sounded similar to the grasshopper that makes that sound."
39,2018-05-06,[''],Easy hike with an awesome mine to go into.  Very fun for the kids.
40,2018-04-29,[''],This was a good hike. The cave is awesome to see.
41,2018-04-25,['hiking'],Pretty good excersixe coming up. I think the view is worth it
42,2018-04-24,[''],Great trail for a morning hike.  There are great views all the way up.
43,2018-04-23,[''],It was good hike I recommend you go with someone you can get lost if it is first time ther get some good hiking shoes I slide down mountain make sure you stay on main trail other than that was good hike and pretty view
44,2018-04-22,[''],We hiked this today (4-22-2018). I’m not sure where they get that this hike is 2.6 miles but it’s 2 miles round trip. The map is wrong. We hiked to Flag Rock which well past Patsy’s Mine. It is a good hike but the app needs to be fixed to show the actual distances.
45,2018-04-17,[''],This is a double win! there is a mine right before you get to the flag that is well worth checking out. Its called Patsi's mine and is only a minute off trail.
46,2018-04-16,['hiking'],The mine is cool and worth the hike. I wouldn't take my children past the mine to the flag. I recommend going up farmington canyon to get to the dirt road then hike from there.
47,2018-03-31,[''],"Fun trail, we took our almost 4 yr old and 18 month old. Pretty steep sections, but worth the hike!"
48,2018-02-25,[''],Great little day hike with family. Hiked this with my five year old. We hit the mine first and then continued up to the flag pole. The road to get you close to mine is easy if you have moderate ground clearance.
49,2018-02-11,['hiking'],"Good stuff did this at sunset, bring lights for the trip down"
50,2018-02-11,['hiking'],"The trail is well maintained other than just a couple areas that are seeing erosion.  Those really weren’t an issue and I felt confident on this trail with my kids.  It is a good climb with a great payoff at the end.  There is a bench to rest and take in the views about half way up and at the top.  Not much shade, so I imagine that it could be a hot one in the summer, but in the cool of an unseasonably dry February, it was very pleasant."
51,2017-12-23,['hiking'],It was a good trail and I loved it! Such a cool place to go.
52,2017-11-25,['hiking'],"We recently moved to Farmington and did the trail yesterday. It is a really nice hike, especially when you are coming down at sunset. Our group had four boys ranging in age from 9-11. It was just right. Highly recommended."
53,2017-10-28,[''],"Loved it.. but need to find a better trail head, we drove our car on fire break road above Farmington pond. Hard hike.."
54,2017-10-07,['hiking'],"Trail marked very well, easy to follow. Clear paths. Lots of switchbacks, making a moderate/intermediate hike. Hiked during fall month, so the weather was cooler and made parts of the trail tolerable since most of it is open/exposed to sun. This is definitely a fall or spring hike. I would guess it would be very hot during the summer. Steep parts may be hard for snowshoeing in the winter. I loved the beautiful fall colors of the surrounding trees, bushes and views from afar. I took my chihuahua/jack mix with me and he did great. I’ll definitely be back to do it again, fun hike! Btw, I recorded my hike on this app: it was 1.3 miles up and I came back down the exact same way but somehow it recorded it as only being .4 of mile down, hahaha I don’t know why it did that! But it showed only 1.7 miles round trip, it is actually 2.6 miles round trip."
55,2017-09-05,[''],"Loved this hike, I would recommend starting at the firebreak road. If you start at the firebreak road it will save you a ton of time and energy."
56,2017-09-04,['hiking'],"we just got done hiking this trail.  Access to the fire road was blocked due to construction, it appears new houses are going in.  The hike from the road up to the fire road was very steep.  It was still a good hike.  You are out in the sun most if the time, so take lots of water!  We took our 12 and 8 year olds with us and they did just fine.  The 8 year old usually complains, but she was a trooper the whole way."
57,2017-08-24,[''],fairly easy trail there is construction so the trail head is a little wonky to get to
58,2017-08-16,[''],Fun hike. The kids loved the mine. It was a bit wet inside the mine.
59,2017-06-29,[''],Trail is pretty steep in some parts but the mine is definitely worth it!
60,2017-06-09,[''],"We hiked up the north end and hiked down the south end.  The north end was a bit shadier and had more variety than the simple switchbacks on the south end. I had myself and husband and 4 kids ages 9, 7, 3, 2.  The two littles had to be carried most of the way and got tired.  The older too were a little tired but did fine with breaks. some parts are kind of steep (maybe it just felt steep whilst carrying a child).  The mine was fantastic.  Nice and cool after being in the hot sun.  We brought head lamps and inflatable solar balls which worked perfect.  Our cell phones were definitely not bright enough.  Mine had water in many places when we went so watch your step, some a ankle deep puddles.  All in all kids loved it-the mine made it worth the heat and whining.  The view was pretty amazing too."
61,2017-06-04,['hiking'],We did this in the afternoon--not enough shade for an afternoon hike. We enjoyed the mine and the view from Flag Rock.
62,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"Nice hike. Steeper at the beginning and end. A nice bench waits for you at the half-way point. Bring flashlights or headlamps for the mine... you phone will not be bright enough. Bring water for each person and a snack, especially with kids.

We parked on the fire road. You'll need an SUV or Truck to get there. The signs say the gate is closed, but I never saw that. When you turn onto the fire road, the trailhead is 1.4 miles from there, with places to park."
63,2017-05-28,[''],Kids loved it!
64,2017-05-10,[''],Not well marked to get to the trail head but once you're on it it is amazing! took 5 and 6 year olds and they rocked it out to Flag Rock!
65,2017-05-05,['hiking'],"Went up the 100% exposed South trail. (Didn't know there was a north and south trail, as if it's 1863) then I found the north, much easier and shadier trail and came down that one. The southern trail has more switch backs. Both trail heads are marked but easy to miss. Went up at 11:30, got to Flag Rock at 1:00 ( slow, I took a few rest breaks going up). Amazing view when you get to the flag. Got back down to the parking lot at 2.  So that's some indication of how this trail is like. Take it or leave it. Good times!"
66,2017-02-17,['hiking'],"We found rabbits and not so amusing rattle snakes, watch where you step.  The mine it self was cool."
67,2016-10-13,['hiking'],The cave at the end makes the hike worth it!!
68,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"Patsy's mine trail is accessible from the Shoreline Trail, and it is great for kids and dogs, at the end of the trail you will find a 200+ feet long cave that is also accessible, so make sure you bring some flashlights to get into the cave, and if you want it's advisable to  have a spotter outside the cave while there is people inside the cave, for those you who would like to get into the cave. The trail is accessible all year round and there is no cost to get into the cave. You can also continue up the mountain to the Flag Rock, which has a United States Flag mounted on a flagpole and you can enjoy the view while you sit in a wood bench that was built there for you to enjoy the view and sunsets."
