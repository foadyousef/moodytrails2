0,2019-09-03,"['hiking', 'bugs']","I didn’t think taking my pup up to Dog Lake was going to feel like trying to walk him through the Tour de France, but it did today. Try and go on a day when bikes aren’t allowed. Also, please note that it’s 3.7 miles ONE WAY, it’s actually over 7 miles total. $3 fee to be in the canyon. I would take bug spray if you’re going to spend lots of time at the lake. "

2,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"Great, fast trail! Even at a very slow pace we were able to make it from the upper parking lot to the lake in less than an hour. Plenty of stream crossings for dogs to drink and stay cool. Get there early for parking; you must pay $3 to exit the canyon so bring some cash. The upper part of the canyon is also closed from Nov 1 to July 1. Dogs are able to hike this trail off leash on odd days, and mountain bikers are only allowed on even days. Plan accordingly! "
3,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"I agree with most of the reviews! I was a little confused where the trail head is because of all the different parking lots, but it starts from the Upper parking lot for Big Water Trail. I got there later in the morning on the 4th of a July and had to park down the road and walk up because all the parking spots were full in the Upper, Lower and Overflow parking lot. Little Water is more steep than Big Water, but I would not consider it a “steep” trail. It’s also less busy than Big Water. I hiked it on the 4th of July and saw less than 10 parties from bottom to top. I took Big Water down which was a nice casual downhill. The lake is a little muddy from dogs stirring up sediment, but it’s still a nice lake and is not smelly (I didn’t give my dog a bath)."
4,2019-07-04,['hiking'],"Went early, in the middle of the week at 830am. It was the best time to go; parking was open, limited hikers, and nice temperatures. But even then there were people filing in. The hike up was steep and arduous, mainly because the steep incline was consistent throughout. It took about an hour to go up with a few breaks along the way. Hike down was about thirty minutes. As the other reviews stated, the lake is small, murky and had a few bugs, but the dogs were loving it. "
5,2018-10-09,[''],"Love this trail because it's a quick hike to the lake and back when pressed for time. If I push a decent pace, getting to the lake can be done in 35 minutes. Two small springs on the way up for the dog to get a drink. Just keep your eyes and ears open for moose!"
6,2018-09-20,[''],Beautiful trail quite steep but also short. I definitely prefer this way to get to dog lake over big water trail. My dogs love to swim so this is definitely one of our favorites.
7,2018-08-26,['hiking'],"This short hike is a blast. It has a nice destination for those with dogs. The lake is more like a pond but our dog loved it. The trail is pretty easy going and very pretty. It gets steep enough to be a little tiresome but if you take breaks, it is definitely doable for any beginner. Parking sucks. If you get there early enough, you’ll be fine. Otherwise you may need to park farther down the road."
8,2018-07-18,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. Much shorter than Big water and more difficult. Gorgeous wild flowers this time of year. Parking is always a pain so go early.
9,2018-07-07,['hiking'],Fun hike! Watch out it gets way busy in the weekends. It’s hard to find parking if your not there early.
10,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"Very steep in places. In mid afternoon temperatures it gets HOT despite a reasonable amount of shade/cover. Bring lots of water.
Parking lot gets busy on weekends. Come early for parking & lower temps. 
The upper canyon gate opens July 1 every year. This makes the trailhead unavailable by vehicle until then, despite AllTrails saying best from April... Snow covered until late May. 
Wildflowers are excellent now (July 3). Lots of dogs & people. Bikes are not allowed on odd numbered days."
11,2018-02-18,[''],I prefer this to the Mill D route. More mellow and more shade.
