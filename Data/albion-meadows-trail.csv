0,2019-08-25,['hiking'],Boring trail.
1,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"Pretty flowers, horrible swarms of flies that constantly swarm your head."
2,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'bugs']","We went at dusk and it was beautiful! Ran into two moose very close to the trail, but they seem used to hikers gawking at them. Also saw some deer and a porcupine. It was great! The wildflowers are beautiful, but there’s lots of bugs. "
3,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"The flowers right now are beautiful and everything is lush green around. I loved it! 
(PS. There is construction going on at the actual trailhead starting point so you’d have to navigate to Wildcat base camp instead and start there)"
4,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","My son (age 10) and I did this hike Aug 4; we took the entrance by the self-park, up the side of the mountain, to the old road, which is all dirt, mud, and very rocky/pebbley. He got tired quickly, but stuck it out and an hour and a half later we were at the ridge looking out at Twin Lakes Reservoir. Beautiful! Saw lots of wildflowers on the way. And beautiful views the whole way. Met lots of very nice people. And afterwords, enjoyed a meal at Snow Bird, followed by tram ride up, chair lift down. Awesome day!"
5,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","My friend and I went today (August 3rd,2019). We got there at around 7:30 a.m and there was plenty of parking. I would recommend parking right before you have to pay and then you can walk about a quarter mile and be at the trail head. The trail itself was beautiful and the surroundings were gorgeous. The only downside were the mosquitoes!! There were so many of them and they're really aggressive! Bring bug spray! "
6,2019-08-03,['hiking'],"I went on August 1st and we went at dusk
the wildflowers were absolutely breathtaking and they were all over we also saw a moose while it was light and we combined Albion meadows and cecret lake as one hike. When we came back down the trail it was pitch black and when we got down to the  Albion meadows trail we had a very scary encounter with two aggressive moose that grunted at us and followed us. If we didn’t have a headlamp we probably would have ran into the moose."
7,2019-07-30,['hiking'],Beautiful flowers right now! It’s a super easy trail for toddlers.
8,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"nice hike with beautiful wildflowers (if they're in bloom) and a nice breeze and open sky. I only wish the route didn't have a dirt road beside it where people drive and it had no true destination point or lookout to hike to necessarily. Also some construction items around you/instruments and cables over your head from the resort..just expect yourself to be not totally ""away"" from civilization on this hike. "
9,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"Quite a lot of wildflowers in bloom but I’d expect that in a week or so there’d be more. The lower trailhead is blocked by construction and it’s not well marked up by the road; we ended up having to walk a quarter of a mile or more back down the road to find a way down to the trail. We had our six-year-old twin boys with us and they enjoyed going through the forest. There were some signs along the trail that had pictures and information about animals in the area, which I though was a nice touch for kids. "
10,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Not many wildflowers in bloom when we went July 20th, but still so beautiful out there! Snow still on the mountains in the distance and a ton of green everywhere else. Some shade the first third or so of the hike, and then you’re just out in the meadow. A little more steep than I expected, but nothing impossible or even bad, just didn’t know coming into it. Many areas level out in the meadows. Had some kids with us: 8, 5, and 2. They did pretty well, but got a bit tired often. Hope to go back in a couple weeks to see the full display of colors! "
11,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
12,2019-07-18,['hiking'],"Beautiful, fresh mountain air. Easy hike to do with kids. The wild flowers should be in full bloom in another couple of weeks. "
13,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",
14,2019-07-08,['hiking'],"Most of the snow has melted off the trail. A few early wildflowers are blooming: forget-me-nots, bluebells, geraniums."
15,2019-06-18,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","The trail was alright, but there is still a thick snow pack. This made it impossible to follow the original route. "
16,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Beautiful! 
17,2018-08-06,['hiking'],"The wildflower did bloom early this year. However, if you explore some of the shady area by the river there are still some beautiful flowers in bloom. Albion basin is always beautiful no matter the season. However, on the weekends during the summer it does get a little crowded."
18,2018-07-26,['hiking'],We were up July 26 and were probably a good 2 or 3 weeks past wildflower peak.  Still plenty of flowers in bloom but vast majority have come and gone. I think the Wildflower Festival is this weekend. Going to be some disappointed peepers. Need to adjust schedule for climate change.
19,2018-07-25,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery and area. A ton of wildflowers but they are a little past prime.
20,2018-07-24,[''],First hike with toddlers!
21,2018-07-23,['hiking'],"Beautiful views all along the path! And pictures just don’t do it justice. 
One we definitely want to do again because we weren’t able to stay long due to not being prepared for the temp drop in the evening."
22,2018-07-13,[''],I was blown away with the beauty of this trail. The wildflowers are currently in bloom and that was amazing. We started hiking around 8:00pm and were able to get to the top by sunset. The alpinglow off the mountains was stunning. You have 360 degree views of the other peaks and canyons all around.
23,2018-07-09,['hiking'],"We only walked one way on this trail today. On the way down, we took the ski lift (mostly as we also went on the nearby Cecret Lake trail, as well). This is our second year on this hike. Since I had read reviews the flowers were already in full bloom, we went on July 8 (2018). Last year we went on July 30. Kind of glad we did not wait as it already seems some flowers are drying out due to the lack of rain this year and also the fact the snow fall was low last year.

Note: Do not go in the midday like we did- the sun was blaring and hot and it made me a tad miserable. The trail starts out with a steady elevation gain, if you aren't used to it, this can add to the misery. Maybe going up on the ski lift and walking down may be a better option. Keep in mind if you go on the lift, you will not go over the meadow where most of the wildflowers are."
24,2018-07-08,[''],"What a gorgeous hike! It has been a dry year, so the wild flowers are already in full swing.  I would get up here before the crowds hit hard.  Remember you have to pay $7 to drive past Alta parking lot anytime after 7:30 am. I wanted to go from the campground parking lot on the upper trail, but they have closed it off which was a drain for that is a beautiful section. My blog shows 360 stitched images of the area.  Check it out for more info. https://shaunasadventures.blogspot.com/2018/07/360-adventure-albion-basion-cecret-lake.html?m=1"
25,2018-07-07,[''],The summer road is closed to cars right now. we walked 25 mins up the road which was exposed and hot and we weren't even close to making it to the trailhead.
26,2018-06-23,['hiking'],"Saw a coyote on the way in! Went on to Cecret Lake and given the road closure at the start, this became a long hike. Splendid though and the wildflowers were gorgeous"
27,2018-06-12,['hiking'],This is a very pretty area and this trail leads to others you can do later. There is still some snow right now so it's a little muddy. Even though the wild flowers haven't bloomed yet the views are beautiful! =)
28,2018-06-10,['hiking'],Overall easy but pretty
29,2018-06-04,['hiking'],Some snow still on the trail. Flowers have not bloomed yet but probably will within a couple of weeks.
30,2018-05-24,[''],Beautiful
31,2017-09-06,['hiking'],"Had been skiing this area, But first time hiking which gives me different view for the area. Like the trail, have some educational sites alongside. Final treat is an opportunity to see 'secret Lake ' about another a mile hike."
32,2017-08-22,['hiking'],Beautiful wildflowers but pretty busy and crowded.
33,2017-08-16,['hiking'],"Best place for wildflowers, in my opinion. Try to avoid the canyon congestion during the wildflower festival and go one or two weeks early."
34,2017-08-11,[''],"some of the best views in the area.  Only issue was going to cecret lake, some of the trail was signed, some was not."
35,2017-08-08,[''],Amazing trail. The wildflowers are absolutely stunning in Peak season. Saw some moose up close when I hiked this a couple weeks ago.
36,2017-08-08,['hiking'],I love this trail!! There is such a huge variety of flowers and it's absolutely breathtaking.
37,2017-07-31,['hiking'],"Did this last week, the wild flowers are amazing right now! The trail is pretty easy, my 4 year old did it with out a problem. We went all the way up to Cecret Lake (3 miles one way from the lower parking lot), which is beautiful. I highly recommend this trail."
38,2017-07-24,['hiking'],"We just went on Friday and this is the perfect time of year to do the trail. All of the wild flowers in bloom, and at least 10° cooler up there than in the Salt Lake Valley. Would definitely recommend doing the full trail up to Cecret Lake. Note that right now there is a small detour in the middle of the trail, due to some reconstruction, but it is not a big deal."
39,2017-07-20,['hiking'],"Gorgeous trail. I wasn't ready for it to be done so when I got to the meadow and saw the trailhead for Cecret Lake, I did that too. This on its own would have been too short I think. The wildflowers aren't in full force, I don't think, or else I just missed it, but would love to go again when there are even more. As it was, it was beautiful and I would do it again. Just go all the way up to Cecret if you do it. :)"
40,2017-07-14,[''],Gorgeous
41,2017-06-25,['hiking'],Beautiful trail! Lots of birds and Uinta ground squirrels around. Still 4-5 snowy patches on the first half of the trail and some mud. An Alta staff member said that Cecret Lake is currently not accessible due to snow.
42,2017-06-23,[''],beautiful
43,2017-03-14,['hiking'],Great hike that offers beautiful views and very easy. If you want to add a little more you can add Cecret  Lake on at the end.
44,2016-10-29,[''],Great family hike
45,2016-10-10,['hiking'],"A very nice hike for the first 2/3 of the uphill leg. Very gradual incline with nice views. Unfortunately at the top of the hill is a parking lot and it kills the ambience a little bit, very noisy with lots of cars going in and out. Views from the parking lot are still nice though."
46,2016-08-28,['hiking'],Did this hike with my family including my mom who is in her 70s. We saw a family of moose along the trail.  It's a beautiful spot.
47,2016-08-20,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail for wildflowers and some great views of the basin.  One of my favorite spots so far in the canyons!  Originally had come up here no expecting to hike this section, but changed my plans due to lack of parking in the upper lots and about 50 people in line for the shuttle...would rather be walking than waiting!  Glad I got to see this!"
48,2016-08-15,[''],Beautiful hike. I went in late June and now mid August. Definitely prefer the late June scenery. I think maybe even early to mid July would be beautiful as well. Still a beautiful hike. Flowers are everywhere. I was forced to take this hike to get to Cecret Lake and then this time to Sunset Peak because of road closures and lack of parking and 40 minute shuttle wait times. Really glad though. The hike is worth it. Many chances for beautiful pictures and not too hard of a hike.
49,2016-08-02,['hiking'],Early August.  Beautiful wild flowers!  Not much shade.
50,2016-07-31,['nature trips'],"It was fine. There isn't a lot of shade, and today there wasn't much of a breeze either. My hiking party went past the Sugarloaf ski lift, and took the left fork. I'm not positive if that is part of this trail or not, but if it is, then this trail should be rated Moderate, rather than Easy. I had a hard time with it, but I am not an experienced hiker."
51,2016-07-30,[''],"Fun trail. Tons and tons of wildflowers. Not a whole lot of shade cover. Kids had a blast, great photo ops."
52,2016-07-22,['trail running'],"Beautiful, but part of the hike is right along the road."
53,2016-07-21,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. Continued up to Cecret Lake. About 3 miles from Alta, through the Albion meadows and up to the lake. There's over a 1200 foot elevation gain in those 3 miles. Gets a little tricky at the end for kids but my 8 year did great."
54,2016-07-18,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite hikes ! The meadows of wild flowers are beautiful! Last time I went in the morning and there were tons of hummingbirds !!! Today I went around 1 and I didn't see a single hummingbird. It's not much of a hike but it is all uphill and lots of small rocks. If you want a longer hike you can keep going up to cecret late and pack a picnic.
55,2016-07-10,['hiking'],We started at the Albion Basin parking lot and ended at Cecret Lake. The distance came out to be around 2.7 miles. The wildflowers are blooming and it was very beautiful. Very windy in spots and kind of crowded.
56,2016-07-10,['hiking'],Beautiful hike this time of year with all of the wild flowers in bloom. Continue up to Cecret Lake for amazing views!
57,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"Great trail for the novice who wants to enjoy the outdoors but not a strong hiker. About 3 miles from the bottom parking lot, through Albion basin and up to Cecret lake."
58,2016-07-09,['hiking'],The wildflower were amazing today. Huge carpet of many different colors.  Trail is well maintained and very busy.
59,2016-07-09,['hiking'],"Nice, easy trail that I'd consider taking older folks or younger kids on. Beautiful meadow views with mountains all around. Smells so good with all the flowers blooming! A must do is to connect to Cecret Lake trail at the top when you get to Alta's Cecret Lift, which is a moderately difficult trail (not for most kids or elderly) but well worth it with the lake views."
60,2016-07-08,[''],Beautiful in mid-late summer! One of our favorite summer traditions.
61,2016-07-06,['hiking'],"Gorgeous wildflowers everywhere! There were so many little cut off trails I'm not sure if I was on the right one, but all lead through a Meadow and it was beautiful! Went up to Cecret Lake after"
62,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Wildflowers are blooming now – don't miss! Excellent, easy hike. We went on to Cecret Lake."
63,2016-06-27,[''],So so beautiful! The hillsides were so beautifully green. We're going to come back soon so we can see all the wildflowers in full bloom- they look pretty close to opening! The kids loved this hike especially the pictures and facts of the animals along the trail.
64,2016-06-26,['hiking'],This hike has very beautiful views and is on the easy side to complete.
65,2016-06-25,[''],Gorgeous hike. Easy to do scenery is breathtaking. I had to take this trail to get to Cecret Lake Trail because the road was closed. I was so glad that happened. This was my favorite part of the hike between the greenery and the snow covered mountains. Wow.
66,2016-06-21,[''],Great family hike.
67,2016-06-20,['hiking'],This is a nice easy trail that winds its way up from the Alta base to the Albion campgrounds.  Right now it is really pretty with the green mountains and rushing creeks/streams.  The wildflowers aren't in bloom which will make this an even nicer hike.  This is a great way to access the other trails higher up the mountain as the Albion Basin Road is closed until July 11th.
68,2015-08-03,['hiking'],"Nice hike but very crowded. Was bused to the trailhead from the alta parking lot. 

What was spectacular was the weather and beautiful basin just packed with an array of colorful flowers.  

The end of the hike was the BEST!  We were able to see a large bull moose and his mate.  They were browsing a side hill near the base of the hill."
69,2015-08-02,[''],The wildflowers are in full bloom and are absolutely stunning! My boys (4 & 6) enjoyed this hike as well.
70,2015-07-30,['hiking'],"How to Get There:  Get onto 215 and get off at the 6200 S. Exit and turn east towards the mountains, it's called Wasatch Blvd. Continue on Wasatch for a few miles. You'll pass Big Cottonwood Canyon on the left, keep going. The road will eventually turn east and take you right into Little Cottonwood Canyon. Go all the way up the canyon till you come to a little Ranger booth in the road. From this booth, take the road that is down to the right. This will take you to a parking lot, The trail can be accessed either behind the Alpine Grill or there is a dirt trail from the Southeast corner of the parking lot. It's called the Albion Meadows Trail. You can pretty much hike as far as you want. It curves up the mountain, a gradual rise and connects to the road that will take you to the Cecret Lake Trail.

This trail was absolutely beautiful, I've never seen so many wildflowers. Millions of them, every color! We also had the good luck to see a Bull Moose. This trail was pretty gradual in rise and was really good for kids as they had little signs all along the trail, highlighting different animals of the area. The kids had so much fun looking for them. Great trail, totally doing it again!"
71,2015-04-18,['hiking'],Beautiful Trail when the wildflowers are blooming. You feel like your in heaven!!!
72,2012-08-01,['hiking'],"Ended up on this trail because the parking lot at the Catherine Pass trailhead was full. Parked by the Alta store. This trail eventually connects with the lift access road, and you can go up over Germania Pass (basically following the sugar loaf lift) and then down Collins gulch. Follow the trail under the Alta town lift back to the parking area. Mostly easy, with a few steep spots. There were very few other hikers on this route but I was passed by 5 or 6 maintenance vehicles. Total time about 4 hrs."
73,2012-06-23,['hiking'],"I took a visiting friend on this trail. Considering it provides a wonderful view of where I taught him to ski, and an even better view of where I like to ski- devils castle area- I call it a success. Too short really. But due to the unusually hot weather (even at the elevation) we broke a sweat. It is very much Entry Level hiking...which I like to call ""walking around outside with direction"".
Being at that elevation does help with timing your trip, however, bc it's usually 10-15 degrees cooler (depending on the time of year). So dress accordingly. This is super helpful to tame this year's summer heat."
