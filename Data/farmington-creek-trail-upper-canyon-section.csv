0,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"This information is for hiking the 1.5-mile round trip hike to the beautiful upper waterfall in Farmington Creek Canyon. There is a trailhead in the loop of the old (now closed) Sunset Campground Loop. Please note, the only marker for the old campground is a large white sign forbidding camping (it is on the right-hand side as you drive UP the canyon.) You can park your car here at the entrance to the old campground. There are large rocks that block vehicle access into the campground, but you can walk in. Once you walk into the campground you will notice numerous tress cut down making it difficult to navigate through the old campground. Near the far end of the short loop you will see a trail with a trail marker for Farmington Creek Trail. This is the trail. The trail is a steep descent toward Farmington Creek. Once you reach the creek, there is an offshoot trail that you can take to the left (upstream) if you want to explore a little more, but the waterfall is a short hike to the right (downstream) from here. You’ll know it when you reach the waterfall. There is a rope that allows you to work your way down the steep rocky embankment to the bottom of the falls. We hiked in mid August, 2019. "
1,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"We drove all the way the windy gravel road and parked near what use to be a campground. The hike down to the waterfall was fairly easy with the exception that there are a few crossing trails and no markers. *follow the sound of water* It's a steep decline to reach the bottom of the big waterfall, but there is a rope to help you down and up making it very doable. The views were breathtaking, pretty much all shade/cover. We will definitely be back! "
2,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"Had a great time on this hike, was wanting a bit of a trail run, and could not keep it going on the way in, but great jog on the way back out. Scramble down to the falls was a nice chance of pace and tons of fun. The waterfall is beautiful. Definitely open for the first 1/2mile, then better shade coverage the rest of the way. On past the falls was much steeper for a nice challenge. Would definitely do it again"
3,2019-07-28,[''],Great hike even if you are out of shape like me!
4,2019-07-17,['hiking'],"There were a lot of crossing trails and not always signs telling me where to go.  All Trails did not have the complete trail either.  According to All Trails, I never made it to the actual Upper Farmington Creek Trail."
5,2019-07-10,['hiking'],"July 10, 2019: Did this hike with our two year in a hiking backpack and it was doable. The waterfalls are very pretty. The second waterfall has a rope you can use to help you down to it because it is very steep to get to it. I did not go all the way down to the waterfall because of our two year old but you can see the waterfall from the trail and it's pretty cool. The trail itself isn't too bad but there are some steep points and some spots are not shaded so make sure to bring sunscreen. There are some creeks you will have to cross and your feet will get wet. "

heres a quick video on what the area looks like!
Love it! I hike this all the time. 
Full of wildlife. Easy hike.
Youll Enjoy"
7,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"The road to the trailhead is narrow and windy. The off-roading vehicle can go fast on the road. Be careful. There are 6 cashed vehicles along the trail. It was a nice trail with several water crossings.
"
8,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Couldn't find the Sunset campground trail head. That campground has been shut down and there were no signs marking it. Ended up driving back down and starting where the first little parking area is after the pavement ends. It was 4.09 miles total and 1295 ft elevation climb taking it from this direction. Warning that it is all uphill with very little shade this way. We saw multiple lizards and a snake. There were also a lot of flies and wasps.

There are wrecked cars in a few different places but some of them you have to hike off the trail to see.  There were three river crossings that my feet got a little wet in but the water was probably higher than normal. The first waterfall was pretty but the second one required holding onto a rope and going down to the bottom, which was hard on the hands because it was very steep. You really couldn't see a lot from the top of the second waterfall because of the trees so to get the view you have to go down the rope. The trail went further from there but we turned around at the roped waterfall. We lost our footing going back down quite a few times because of the steepness."
9,2019-06-29,['hiking'],The waterfall definitely made the hike worth it!
10,2019-06-28,['hiking'],"Great short how hike. The waterfall is beautiful, definitely I’d do it again. No many places for camping also, last weekend was vey crowded."
11,2019-06-24,['hiking'],"Pleasantly surprised by this trail. Always on the lookout for something with water and trees, this more than met those expectations. Flowers and dragon flies were in full swing. Great afternoon hike! "
12,2019-06-23,[''],"Love this hike, the old cars are cool. The waterfall is what we usually hike to and then turn around. It's a favorite for sure. "
13,2019-06-19,['hiking'],Phenomenal trail! More than worth the trip! 
14,2019-06-18,['hiking'],Always one of my favorite trails. The waterfall is amazing this year! Plus this is one of very few trails this spring that you can hike and still have dry shoes when you're done. Hiked out in the dark. There were lots of spiders but also one very cute prickly caterpillar. 
15,2019-06-17,['hiking'],"Nice, relatively easy hike that ends with a gorgeous waterfall. We encountered a ton of lizards and one large (unidentifiable) snake. Watch where you step!"
16,2019-06-16,['hiking'],worth it
17,2019-06-16,['hiking'],"Love it for kids and dog perfect! My kids age 8, 10 and 12 "
18,2019-06-13,[''],My husband and I loved this hike. Such a relaxing hike with sound of the river running.  Suggest it  to my friends. Go and enjoy....
19,2019-06-06,['hiking'],This was a great trail. It was a lot of fun going up and then did a slow jog back down the trail. Amazed at the amount of people going up late evening time. 
20,2019-05-31,[''],"Loved this trail. just gorgeous views, small waterfalls, creek crossings and cars. Yep, it's a graveyard for cars and you will pass 3 cars. Rope to take you down to the falls was a little slippery due to the powerful waterfall spray but highly recommend going down anyway. Trail was dry with wildflowers, butterflies and green views everywhere. Bring a hammock and just hang out and listen to the water raging through. My Garmin showed 1417ft elevation gain from the lower parking lot. The gate was closed so we had to walk the mile on the road to the trailhead. In our opinion that was the worst part."
21,2019-05-25,['hiking'],"Great trail close to my house, I pulled the tire out of the middle of the first water fall so it should make for better photos now.  There’s a couple more I plan on pulling out the next time up, gotta keep nature natural.  It’s an easy trail that I highly recommended!"
22,2019-05-13,[''],so Google maps took me not up the canyon but over to the other side of the mountain and over by the pond. I was super confused as the trails ove there lead you no where lol. I decided that I would head up Farmington Canyon and this is where I figured out where this place it. The gates were closed so you've got a decent trek pretty up the mountain which personally whooped me and my 8 yr old. there was no shade there but when you finally hit the trail it was AMAZING! It not super shaded so bring sun block and a lot of water. we had good snow this year so the rivers were raging on. we only made it to the 1st waterfall area but it was good enough for us after we got lost trying to find this place. worth the hike! Totally loved it!
23,2019-05-05,['hiking'],One of my favorites so far. It is a beautiful trail that follows the creek. The water is pretty full right now which made it fun. The waterfall is pretty big too due to all the water. Climbing down to it wasn’t as hard as it looks. I highly recommend!
24,2019-05-02,['hiking'],"My new favorite canyon hike, BY FAR. Did this before the recent snow and all the run off made for huge rivers and a MASSIVE waterfall at the end. If you want a trail where you can get lost in the adventure, this is your hike. it has so many tributary trails that I couldn't even imagine going down them all without starting very early in the morning. This canyon feels enormous and grand once you're inside, majestic and intimate when you're wading across the few streams that cross the path (bring extra socks for the bottom, you're gonna submerge your feet), and just blown away by the beauty and variability of the setting. Awesome hike. Easily beats Adam's and Waterfall canyons. Have fun!"
25,2019-05-02,['hiking'],Did this hike on the 27th of April. The gate is still closed so you hike up the road just under a mile to get to the trailhead. Trail was snow free all the way to the waterfall. The side creeks were ankle deep at two of the crossings. Loved the hike! Absolutely beautiful! Great time to see the waterfall with the snowmelt.
26,2018-10-02,['hiking'],
27,2018-09-08,['hiking'],Great. I’d definitely do it again. Only gave it 4 stars because we went in the heat of the day. Our mistake. The trail is shaded about 50% of way which really saved us.
28,2018-08-03,['hiking'],"Fantastic hike with great views and a nice waterfall near end.  Saw 5 people on trail.  Only marked down a star due to the road being closed to trailhead.  I understand its closed probably for leftover snow, but it's the end of April! It added about 2 miles to hike."
29,2018-08-02,[''],"Fun hike, shaded in the trees. Couple of places for nice views. Drive up the canyon road till pavement ends and park there and trailhead is there. Didn’t do the super steep section (where rope is) down to 2nd waterfall. Between short legs and old knees I thought it best to skip that section. I am 65 and just getting into hiking and didn’t seem too strenuous at all. Much easier than getting to waterfall up Adam’s Canyon in Layton."
30,2018-07-18,['hiking'],"Start this one early!  We started at 9am, and after exploring the cave at the beginning, having a snack at the 1st waterfall (1 mile in), poking around all the old cars, and then playing in the big waterfall (2 miles in) for a while, we were hiking down around 2pm in the outrageous sun and temps.  The descent to the big waterfall is very steep and about 40ft. down.  There is a rope, and my 15 and 8 year olds handled it easily.  My 12 and 10 year olds with autism basically slid down carefully on their bums while holding onto the rope.  We played in the waterfall to cool down and had a great time.  The climb out was a beast for my special needs kids, but they did it and were SO PROUD!  Normally the trail back to the car seems to go by in a flash.  This time it seemed never-ending.  Must have been the heat.  This trail is about 50/50 sun and shade, so at least we had moments out of the sun.  This one would be gorgeous in the Fall."
31,2018-05-13,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. A bit harder than expected; is rate this moderate. Slight and slow incline. Old cars were creepy but interesting. My 11 year old handled it like a trooper! Several places you have to cross small streams. Would do it again!
32,2018-05-06,[''],"Just completed this hike, well most of it. The path is very covered with greenery, sticks, and brush. Very hard to see at times where you are walking. We saw multiple [rattle]snakes on this trail. Once you get to the fork at the end, the path is hard to determine so we turned around. The path is not shaded and muddy in some parts. Also, you must walk a steep mile uphill to get to the trailhead. GOOD LUCK!"
33,2018-02-03,['hiking'],This was a good trail.  Lots of cars over the cliff and was sad seeing the beat up cars on the mountain and tires  in the river.  There were at 3 waterfalls  the highest one still covered in ice.. very beautiful in winter.  Up higher snow shoes or spikes on our shoes would have helped but no prob with just running shoes on.  I’m sure summer there are too many ppl.  Will stick to going in the winter.
34,2018-01-19,['hiking'],"During winter the main road is closed so there is a 20 minute walk to the actual trail before hand. But it is a beautiful wet hike. Bring some warm clothes in case it snows like it did with me. A great easy/moderate hike with no music needed, just listen to the sounds of the creek and you’ll be sure to lose yourself among the trees."
35,2017-10-25,[''],Magical and almost too good to be true. Waterfall enthusiast. Beautiful state and locals have been so kind to this Oklahoma Lady. Loving my stay here.
36,2017-10-18,[''],great trail
37,2017-10-08,['hiking'],"The directions on this has you parking next to lagoon. You actually walk through the lagoon trail and then you figure you’d better walk toward the mountain since you thought this was a hiking trail on the mountain, hahaha (the signs are limited). It was a nice climb up but since there were hardly any signs and the path is faint on some parts and then many other paths show up along he way and don’t know where to go (due to he lack of signs) you can easily jump onto another trail. Which I did, I ended up on bonneville shore line trail instead. The trail is open/exposed to the sun, maybe a bit warm during the summer months. It was great weather when I went in October. Some people were shooting their guns out in the area so you need to be aware of that so you don’t walk in their path. I’d like to try again but be on the Farmington creek trail, rather than the bonneville shoreline trail. I ended up doing 4.1 miles out and back with little elevation gain."
38,2017-09-18,[''],Took my puppy and she could handle it.
39,2017-09-08,['hiking'],Great trail for a quick hike. Took our 6 yr old and 10 yr old they had a great time. Easy trail a couple of steep spots but not bad.
40,2017-09-03,[''],Same trail as the Farmington Creek Trail listed on AllTrails
41,2017-08-26,['hiking'],"This is the same hike as Farmington Creek Trail.  These two entries should be merged.  And after taking along an inexperienced friend, I would agree with the Farmington Creek rating of moderate.  Starts at the parking pullout where the pavement ends up Farmington Canyon.  Hike just to the falls or continue on to Sunset Campground.  Beautiful hike above and through Farmington Creek.  Very enjoyable."
42,2017-08-22,['hiking'],"Really nice trail, not too steep, an easy 2 hour or less trip with time for stops. Several mini-waterfalls and stream crossings, beautiful valley views, enough shade along the way to get some relief. WARNING: I didn't read the other reviews and missed the parking lot.  It should be obvious, but I thought it was farther...it is on a switchback as the road turns to gravel.  I realized my mistake after awhile and made a precarious turn around...easy to see how the cars along the hike ended up there!"
43,2017-08-22,['hiking'],Did this after work yesterday. Was a good workout while not to demanding. This is the same route as another trail. This is the same trail as another hike listed. The funny thing is this is listed as easy and the other one as moderate. Overall it is a fun hike and you get some great views
44,2017-08-18,['hiking'],"Nice cave at the start of the route to take photos in. But it smells like marijuana a little, and ashes from campfire smoke cover the ground, so not recommended to stay and play in it. Just a nice quick photo op. 

We enjoyed the old cars along the route, and cooling off in the streams and waterfalls. If doing this hike in the summer, and you're with kids, try to get on the trail early! It's hot and not a lot of cover. Kids tend to set a slow pace. So going in the morning would make it more enjoyable."
45,2017-08-16,[''],"Absolutely one of my favorites.  Besides the old cars, tires,  washer,  water heater that's been dumped and fallen from the road above it has a fantastic waterfall that you can climb down to with a rope someone has tied off for us."
46,2017-07-31,['hiking'],"I took my grandsons on this hike this morning. It is a great hike for boys because it has so many rewards! There are a total of four vehicles that have fallen off the canyon road and are near the trail. There is also a waterfall at the end and a small cave at the beginning. The trail does continue up to the campground, but we stopped at the waterfall, which makes it about a 3 1/2 mile hike round trip. I took a screenshot of the location on the map for 3 of the vehicles and of where the waterfall is. I added those pictures to this app. You do have to repel down a steep hill holding on to a rope someone was so kind to leave to get to the waterfall. My 10, 11 and 13 year old grandsons were able to do it and so was their 57 year old grandma. Most of the trail is shaded in the morning. We only ran into a few people. I recommend this hike for families. It's very fun."
47,2017-07-29,[''],"It's a nice enough trail... pretty easy as far as no need to scramble, being well defined, no extreme up and downs and only moderate altitude gain. It is narrow, though, single file, and parts are right on the edge of drop offs. I don't know if I'd be comfortable with younger children be-bobbing along it unless they have some experience because if they get careless, they could go off the side of some fairly precipitous drops. Nice to hear the river below most of the way. Nice waterfall near the end. Goes through shady areas here and there, and you cross a couple of places where shallow, not wide, water flows over the trail. There's a sense of sameness along it's length, though. Still, overall, nice... great canyon vistas."
48,2017-07-26,[''],This is a green trail and it very steep. We did it with an eight month in backpack. Waterfall is pretty and it wasn't crowded when we did it on July 24th. Only bad thing was we went under a tree branch and lots of red ants got on us and bit our daughter in backpack.
49,2017-07-20,[''],"easy, however to get to the waterfall you go down a steep portion where someone has luckily added rope. I wouldn't think kids could make it to well down that last portion, but they can still see the waterfall in the distance up top."
50,2017-07-15,['hiking'],"A beautiful hike but definitely not easy! My husband and I, and my 15 & 13 year olds all are huffing and puffing most of the way. We are glad we did it but I wish I had been a little more prepared for how tough it was. ;)"
51,2017-07-07,[''],"Awesome hike, everyone must do."
52,2017-07-06,['trail running'],This trail is perfect for beginner trail runners. The incline is very gradual although it is a very narrow path. It leads to a waterfall that you have to climb down a road to really see it fully. If you keep going past the waterfall the climb gets much steeper.  My 12 year old and I really enjoyed it.
53,2017-07-03,['hiking'],simple 3 mile trek round trip from the pavement ends parking lot to the falls worth the time
54,2017-07-03,['hiking'],"One of my new favorites. beautiful trail, not too crowded, and the waterfall at the end is gorgeous, if you're willing to climb down to the base of it. There is a rope there to help with the descent and ascent, but I didn't feel safe taking the dog down with me. Amazing at the bottom though."
55,2017-07-03,[''],Good hike. Family friendly
56,2017-06-28,[''],"Pretty fun, family friendly trail. Takes you to a pretty cool water fall and right now it is gushing because of all the snowmelt. The hike goes by pretty quick."
57,2017-06-26,['hiking'],Fantastic trail! Beautifully shaded and just enough challenge to keep it interesting. All of this with the sound of rushing water from the stream and waterfalls ever present on the hike. I love this App also. I came to Farmington from Miami and was determined to hit the trails.  The app helped me narrow down the best trail for me and get a preview with pictures and reviews from other hikers. The GPS feature allowed me to map it all out. Love!!
58,2017-06-20,['hiking'],"The first bit of this trail is in the sun, then you finally get a break when the trail starts curving more into the mountain side! Great, easy trail with my 8 and 4 year old boys! Bring lots of water if you go on a hot day!! The waterfall is pretty cool and the crashed car is neat to hike up to, there are a few areas to sit down and have a snack or break."
59,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"This is really a nice, short hike.  It took a little less than 2 hours, including time to wander around and hang out. I went early in the morning before there was anyone else out. The parking for the trailhead is immediately after the paved road ends.  It's pretty obvious, as there is a parking area, although I initially got confused and kept going even though Googlemaps had it exactly right. If you keep going on the narrow and scary dirt road (Farmington Canyon Road) you can drive up quite a bit further, including to Sunset Campground Rd, where there are campsites and another trailhead from which you can hike down to the falls on a short but steep trail. Some of the posted pictures here show cars that fell off of Farmington Canyon Road into the canyon. You could in theory do this as a loop, going up the trail and coming down the road, but I can't imagine why you would want to walk down the dirt road when the trail is shady and beautiful, running along the creek."
60,2017-06-15,['hiking'],Beautiful rigorous hike! Fun hike down to waterfall! When u park the trail head is directly behind the parking.
61,2017-06-14,['hiking'],A great hike with several stream crossings and waterfalls along the way. A beautiful hike in the morning. Look for the unmarked trailhead in the northwest corner of the parking lot where the road transitions from asphalt to dirt.
62,2017-06-06,[''],Gorgeous trail. In the morning it's shaded a lot with a great breeze from the water. So much fun. I will definitely be doing this again
63,2017-05-31,[''],"nice trail with a great waterfall. Alltrails is marking the road as the trail instead of the actual trail as the trail. you can see on the map the real trail. Besides, the trailhead is obvious once you get there. the distances and elevation gain of the trail are wrong because they are measuring the road."
64,2017-05-21,[''],easy trail. nice views.
65,2017-05-13,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, some parts are pretty rocky narrow  and steep looks like it might have  been washed out from the wet winter and spring we had."
66,2017-04-18,['hiking'],"River is polluted by car laying above falls. 

Park at lower trail parking for extended distance, following trail signs up and across the road, you'll come to a dirt road that takes you down to the gate. (Parking at gate available) Sunset trail is about .7 miles from gate, to the right. Bikers frequent paved road. Decent incline. Narrow path, best on dry days with kids."
67,2016-09-12,[''],We went up and down very easily and the waterfall beautiful.
68,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"We had a hard time finding where to start this one, we parked in a little unmarked lot right where the pavement ends and turns into the dirt road up the canyon. The trail starts on the north side of the lot uphill. Very pretty as the leaves are starting to change. Uphill at first was hard for my daughter but overall an easy hike. It was fun checking out the old cars and there are some ropes you can use to get down to the base of the big waterfall. My kids LOVED that part of it, but they are older. Not something I would let 12 or under do. Not a busy trail at all, only saw a few others. We will definitely be back!"
69,2016-08-22,['hiking'],This is easy hike all the way to the waterfall and cross the stream and continue on the trail you will see a car in your right and continue to the end there is another white car.
70,2016-08-14,[''],"A good single track trail but narrow, wide enough for single file hiking.   Not wide enough for a stroller.   Was able to hike 1.2 miles with stroller, but a lot of carrying the stroller.  Ended up turning back as the trails continued to narrow. 

Easy to moderate difficult trail, not stroller friendly. With stroller trail is hard but can be fine with a but of effort."
71,2016-07-23,['camping'],"Beautiful trail with plenty of shade late in the evening. Hiked in last night, spent the night at a little camp site just above the falls. Hiked out this morning."
72,2013-04-23,['hiking'],"The trail, if it is the right one, is off of the Sunset Campground up Farmington Canyon.  The sign said Farmington Creek Trail.  So I will be reviewing that one.  It is more than 0.5mi, I didn't finish because I only planned on 0.5mi and it was getting late.  It is a nice trail.  It goes down at first so you have to climb up to get back to the campground.  It also winds through several car wreck sites.  There is a waterfall you pass, I did not see a trail to going down and getting a closer look at it, but there might be."
