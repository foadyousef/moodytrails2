0,2019-09-03,['hiking'],I did this hike for the first time yesterday with my 4 yr old grandson. He has hiked the Waterfall Canyon trail twice and Indian Trail with me. We only hiked 2.4 miles in and back for a total 4.8 miles yesterday. He kept asking if we could just go a little farther. 
1,2019-08-22,['hiking'],"I hiked this with my 3-year-old, two 4-year-old, a one-year-old and three other adults. We hiked 1 mile in, and as other reviewers stated, this part of the trail was moderate, not hard. Other than the beginning of the trail, it was shaded and followed along side a creek, although it was mostly dry. This may be fun to do earlier in the summer when there is water in the creek still. We took the advice of others and wore bug spray. I definitely saw more bugs the higher we got up the trail. They mostly didn't bother me.

Be aware the there are many, many side trails. We definitely would have gotten lost if I hadn't been watching the AllTrails app to make sure we stayed on course.

 It was an interesting hike for the little boys and had beautiful plant life and scenery. We would love to do this one again."
2,2019-08-09,['hiking'],It was excellent!
3,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"If you’re looking for a incline trail and shade, this is the trail. There is a creek at the bottom, but nothing as you start to climb so bring water. Bring a snack and enjoy the beautiful views at the top! "
4,2019-08-03,['hiking'],Very uphill. Rocky. Not my jam. Views of Ogden from the top are pretty awesome. 
5,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'scramble']","This trail was quite difficult for me as a beginner, but well worth it. The trail was mostly shaded which was nice on a 90 degree day... The temps were even lower the more you gained in elevation. We took the route that passes Kristin’s Spring, which is why I marked this trail as having a scramble. To get to the spring (which I highly recommend), you have to scramble up about 50 yards of shale/sand. You can take a break at the spring and fill up your water bottles. It tastes amazing! We reached the top after about 2 hours (because I like to take breaks and also because we located some delicious mountain strawberries). Also, there are bugs. By bugs, I mean wasps. They didn’t bite or sting though. My recommendation would be to try a few moderate hikes before attempting this one. The view from the top of this trail is such a reward for all your hard work."
6,2019-08-03,['hiking'],"Great hike with a steep ascent during the latter half. Like Hidden Valley, there’s a great view at the top. Bring lots of water if you plan to hike this when the sun is out. "
7,2019-08-01,['trail running'],Solid and difficult trail run. Well marked and good footing throughout. Great views along the way and a lot of shade. 
8,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"We started this hike at 6:30am and back by 10am. It was a pretty steep incline, but very doable. The views at the peak were amazing and totally worth it! "
9,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"This trail kicks your butt, but when you finish you feel like you really conquered the world! "
10,2019-07-22,['hiking'],beautiful hike!! recommend lots of water and taking your time!! the first part of the journey not so bad but getting to the second half is nothing but uphill.
11,2019-07-16,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite hikes in this area. Make no mistake; the trail is challenging. It’s a steep, steady climb. But it’s a very well groomed trail, and much of the way is shaded by plentiful trees. Great views, too. I always start from the end of 27th st. Highly recommend!"
12,2019-07-13,['hiking'],Great trail all around.  It’s a leg burner with lots of steady climbing.  Trail widens once you pass the first outlook and for me that’s more comfortable especially when there is traffic.  It is a popular trail on weekends 
13,2019-07-13,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","This trail is a beast, BEAST I tell you, but it is my favorite hike. It is amazingly hard and fantastic. Beautiful views. It is mostly covered, which is nice, but I would still wear sunscreen. The peak. And out look are both exposed. If you take your four legged friends take lots of water for you and them. Bug spray too, I got a few horsefly bites. We did come across one baby rattler, but we stopped and gave him some space and he backed off and moved away. We started at 27th street. You do cross the river a couple places, but it was down enough that we didn’t get wet. "
14,2019-06-26,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! Was worried about seeing rattlesnakes on the trail, but lucked out this time. Just as others said, it’s a moderate hike until you cross the river and then it’s tough. Took us about 2 hours total with several breaks on the way up. Amazing view! "
15,2019-06-23,[''],Challenging but rewarding!
16,2019-06-15,['hiking'],"BEAUTIFUL!! The views at the top were astounding but the lush green of the trees were the real VIP. 
I started from 27th street. I didn’t cross the first bridge but that required a bit of hiking through the creek, only about 5 minutes before the trail is dry again. Steep but didn’t necessitate poles up or down. Took about 2.5 hrs around trip and my polar clocked 7 mi. Enjoy! "
17,2019-06-15,"['hiking', 'bugs']","This trail was a great workout! It is a little bit longer if you start at the 27th street trail head, about 5 miles total, but a great hike. It is harder once you pass the bridge into the switchbacks with a high elevation gain. We did see 2 smaller rattle snakes, the first one was on the way up after the bridge at the first rocky area. The second one was down the the river on the way back, it was crossing the trail and almost got my two dogs. I recommend but spray as there are a lot of bugs once you start getting on the actual mountain and sunscreen as well although the trail is shaded most of the way, I still got sunburnt on my shoulders. "
18,2019-06-11,"['hiking', 'rocky']","I loved this trail! I started at 27th st trailhead and found it a little confusing to get on the right path as there was so many but I followed the path shown by AllTrails and made it! I recommend shoes like Chacos for going through the river as it does cross it. The view at the peak wasn’t as amazing as the hike itself due to all the pollution. It starts off following the river and leads into the forested mountain and is stunning with the pines and wildflowers. It took me about 1 hr 45 min up and about a half hour down. Watch out for snakes as well, saw a 5 ft one sunbathing on the path who thankfully moved over when I was trying to cross."
19,2019-06-11,[''],I love the view from the peak. it's awesome. The hike wasn't really bad. it was a good hike 
20,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
21,2019-06-09,[''],"Great hike, water in the lower areas and your feet will get wet.  Really appreciated the water dish for dogs at the top."
22,2019-06-08,['hiking'],"Steep trail, but the view at the top is incredible. You might get a little wet going up the Taylor canyon portion of the trail. For part of it you are basically hiking up the stream, but it doesn't go on for too long. "
23,2019-06-07,[''],straight uphill!
24,2019-06-04,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Excellent trail for running and hiking.  Beware of the tree roots 
popping out of the trail. Ankle breakers if you aren't watching closely...like me"
25,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
26,2019-06-01,[''],"Beautiful trail, which happens to be my first real hike since moving here. The trail starts off along and through the stream, and then goes up from there, which is a single lane trail that is 85% shaded. I would recommend this hike to anyone, the views are spectacular at the top. "
27,2019-05-31,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",coolest trail I've ever hiked.
28,2019-05-29,['hiking'],The waterfall can be found off the right side of the where the river splits. It is before the first big switchback. Worth checking out
29,2019-05-19,['hiking'],A little bit of snow left over from the last bit of weather but made it just fine in regular shoes. Quite a bit of water on the way up via Taylor Canyon. Trail was peaceful and beautiful. Pretty steep but trail is maintained well and lots of nice spots to rest and catch your breath. My phone tracked 7 miles from the 29th st trailhead to the peak round trip. 
30,2019-05-15,[''],good
31,2019-05-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",This was an excellent early morning hike. It starts out shady. Generally steep trail with lots of views of the valley and the SNOW covered peaks including Ben Lomond. Ice and snow  packed near the top. Cleats recommended.
32,2019-05-03,"['hiking', 'snow']","This is a steep but beautiful trail! The last half mile was pretty sketchy with snow and ice. I was able to do it with my trekking poles, but wished I had brought my yak traks (especially coming back down)."
33,2019-04-21,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Love this trail! It’s challenging. Short-ish and beautiful. We wanted to watch the sunset from the top but less than a half a mile from the peak there was snow the rest of the way and micro spikes or yak tracks I would say would be much safer to use than just trail shoes. Had we had full day light and not a storm on our tail we may have made it to the top but with the rain starting and it being slippery going up we knew that it would be much more slippery on the way down.
34,2019-04-04,['hiking'],I love this hike. It is great for dogs and during early spring it’s super secluded. (Though if you have a dog that is a leash pulled the snow is pretty slick)
35,2019-03-30,"['hiking', 'snow']","Packed snow on the trail, manageable with just my boots. Pretty views throughout. I'm not much for urban views, which is the end point of this trail, but perhaps once the snow is melted I'll explore the peak into the basin."
36,2019-03-21,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']",
37,2019-03-12,"['hiking', 'snow']",Such a great hike and so beautiful!
38,2019-02-09,"['hiking', 'snow']",
39,2019-01-24,['hiking'],Used microspikes up to malans peak then waterfall canyon. Beautiful day!
40,2019-01-23,[''],"Steep, butt-kicking hike with amazing views throughout but especially at the top. No prob in the snow, would have been easier with micro spikes/yak tracks."
41,2018-12-11,[''],"I just did this hike about a week ago. The snow makes it a little bit more challenging, but that’s the fun of it. It’s a short but steep hike so you feel like you’re still getting a good workout, and the views on the way up are amazing."
42,2018-11-16,['hiking'],Great hike short but sweet
43,2018-10-23,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. Steep but manageable. I wouldn't rate this as a hard peak but take your time. Mostly shaded so it went from chilly to warm as you got into the sun. Did this last Sunday and it was a nice 70 outside. Gorgeous views of the valley and take your time at the top to enjoy. Your hard work will pay off!
44,2018-10-19,['hiking'],"Moderately steep!  A nice upper glute burner through a cool ponderosa pine forest with long traverses.  A very nice trail run/hike.  There's a stream with a gradual water fall on the shared trail with Taylor's Canyon.  After crossing the second bridge the trail continues to the right.  It's a bit steep at first but the grade becomes less severe the rest of the way up.  There is butte with a view a third of the way up.  At the rocky top peak or butte is exposed with great views of the valley below and Mount Ogden behind.  The descent had a few rocky turns, but it wasn't bad.  Just watch your step."
45,2018-10-07,[''],This trail takes you through beautiful pine forest. The view from the top is also nice.
46,2018-10-05,['hiking'],I have been browsing through the trails in the Ogden area and I'm not quite sure why this one had not been completed yet.  I hike this trail a couple times a year.  It is a well traveled trail and I usually choose to go at the end or beginning of the hiking season.  Any other time it is a very crowded trail.  It is always worth the little extra travel to drop into Malan Basin.  It is a beautiful spot.  If your really up for the challenge then you can take this all the way to Mt. Ogden.
47,2018-09-29,[''],Good hard trail to hike.  Beautiful views!
48,2018-09-16,[''],It's very steep steep towards the top which can be a challenge. Overall great trail though!
49,2018-09-16,[''],crazy elevation... coming from Phoenix AZ...loved it.
50,2018-09-11,['hiking'],This is awesome and was a demanding hike which I will not forget
51,2018-08-31,[''],My favorite! It pushes you without killing you♥️
52,2018-08-29,['hiking'],"great hike for the experienced.  Steep, relentless incline to AMAZING view points.  Very good work out, hike up and run down.  **MAKE SURE to fill your water at the spring about a mile in!! It's delicious and cold!!"
53,2018-08-26,[''],Love it! Beautiful scenery!!
54,2018-08-20,[''],"This was a pretty hike.  It’s shaded most of the way, and has a few beautiful look outs.  We couldn’t find the waterfall, but we didn’t look too hard.  I’d do it again, but I much prefer hiking to waterfalls or lakes or along creeks."
55,2018-07-29,['hiking'],"This hike is fairly short, but can be quite tough with the steep continual climb to the top, so be prepared. I've seen many people struggling on this hike to reach the top. The view at the top is a good payoff and if you have a little more time, you can take a short 10 - 15 minute hike from the summit down to Malan's Basin. There are a couple campgrounds off the side of the trail doing down to Malan's Basin and another couple at the bottom. If you explore the campgrounds off the side of the trail on your way down, they have a pretty good view of the valley below."
56,2018-07-27,['hiking'],"This trail is awesome. The first half is not too steep, following along a creekbes through acanyon with rocky mountains on either side. The second half is very steep, but it's all shaded so you don't have to worry about overheating from the sun. The view at the top is breath taking, with plenty of room to lie down and hang out. I saw lots of butterfly's, lots of lizards, a snake, and some pretty large spiders."
57,2018-07-16,[''],"Fun hike! A great workout and fairly steep most of the way. The trail was busy on a Saturday morning so watch where you step, lots of dog poop on the trail. Not much water running either."
58,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"There is quite a dense network of trails in this area, especially at the bottom of the canyon, and it looks like you could do this in a couple of different ways. Parts of this trail are included in at least 3 other trail entries on AllTrails. I just started at the end of 27th street and followed the signs for the north side of Taylor Canyon, and then took the signed turn to Malan Peak. After you take that turn, it is as others have said, relentlessly steep uphill. You can pretty much get the idea from the benchmark lines on the map. I guess the thing is to go slow and maintain a cheery disposition. Almost no water in the creek, no snakes and very few bugs this early Sunday morning. After reaching the peak I went another .5 miles into Malan Basin, which was nice and a bit cooler, but I guess I turned around just short of reaching the old resort. 

From the map it looks like you could do this as a loop using the Beus Canyon Trail, but other reviews warn that this is very difficult and requires bushwhacking. It's not clear if this refers to hooking up with the Beus Canyon, Waterfall Canyon or Mount Ogden trails. I don't think I would ever have the energy for the option of winding all the way up to the top of Mount Ogden from this trail, especially when you can take a gondola most of the way up from Snowbasin."
59,2018-07-15,[''],Love this hike! Very steep! But the full hike is 7 miles not 4.4 ...
60,2018-07-06,['hiking'],Hiked this trail with my 9 year old and my parents. It was an uphill journey. Had to stop quite a bit near the top. I’m in moderate shape. It was an awesome workout with a beautiful view at the summit!  Good amounts of shade along the way to help make steep trail manageable!
61,2018-07-05,[''],"My husband and I completed this hike on July 4.

This was an awesome hike! Yes, it's steep, but there was way more shade than we expected, so it wasn't too miserable. 

The views st the top were great, and everyone we encountered on the trail was friendly.  Great hike to celebrate the 4th of July! 

Would really recommend this hike to those who are up for the challenge!"
62,2018-07-02,[''],A hard hike especially if you are overweight and out of shape but definitely worth it! The view is amazing! I would like to see dogs on leashes though.
63,2018-07-02,[''],Really nice hike! pretty steep all the way up but definitely worth it. watch for rattlers!!!
64,2018-06-24,[''],"Great hike! Beautiful views and and really good workout.  A group of people coming down before us saw a rattler, so be careful."
65,2018-06-22,[''],"I love this hike! It’s mostly shaded. It is a steep incline most of the way, but there are beautiful views at the halfway and the top! A great workout"
66,2018-06-19,['hiking'],"Loved this hike, most of it is shaded so it’s great mid day! Amazing view points so plenty of pit stops if you need a break(: My dogs loved it, a river runs by at the half way point and a waterbowl is set up at the end; that was great! Worth trying just make sure to be prepared for a straight incline hike."
67,2018-06-18,[''],Awesome view at the top! Decent incline most of the way up- worth it though
68,2018-06-18,['hiking'],Incline the whole way...can be tough but the view is worth the cardio
69,2018-06-09,[''],Incredible views at the top! Steep climb but worth getting to the top.
70,2018-06-06,['hiking'],"Amazing hike! First mile is pretty much flat, Then the last mile is all switchbacks and steep climbing. Trail was well defined, and pretty clear from shrubs and trees. Went at sunset. Can make it up in an hour if you really push. The views are well worth the steep climb though."
71,2018-05-24,['hiking'],it’s a subtle burner on your legs at first then increases dramatically. a beautiful hike with a gorgeous overlook of the weber state campus and the rest of the ogden valley.
72,2018-05-20,['hiking'],Fun hike! Lots of shade :) Our fitness tracker calculated a mile more than the distance it shows. Very steep after the first half but worth it for the view!
73,2018-05-02,['hiking'],"Amazing view at the top. Super steep, I was dying all the way to the top, but it was worth it."
74,2018-04-27,[''],"Fantastic hike with beautiful views, shade, and waterfalls!"
75,2018-03-25,[''],Great trail. Steep but worth it!
76,2017-12-10,['hiking'],One of my favorite trails. So much beauty. Will kick your butt!
77,2017-10-24,[''],The view was amazing and the hike wasn't that difficult at all. there are some steep parts though but it is one of my favorite hikes. It was totally work the hour drive.
78,2017-10-02,['hiking'],"Became one of my favorite hikes in Ogden yesterday. With the fall colors, the dusting of snow and the views... the whole trail felt magical."
79,2017-08-18,[''],Great hike. A butt kicker for sure! But the view at the top and on some of the switchbacks are completely worth it!
80,2017-08-18,[''],great hike. steep!
81,2017-08-14,['hiking'],Steep but what a wonderful view!!
82,2017-08-05,[''],Really fast and gets steep
83,2017-07-31,[''],Beautiful view at the top!! Second half of the hike is very steep! Coming down is quick.
84,2017-07-16,[''],I would like to see some biking reviews
85,2017-06-25,['hiking'],Very scenic. Beautiful views. Up hill the hole way. I prefer this hike to waterfall canyon.
86,2017-06-16,[''],"DOUBLE WARNING! Do NOT attempt the loop trail. I went with my teenage son and friend and my dog (all super fit) and our 5 mile hike turned into a 5-6 hour bushwhacking, rock scrambling, dangerous decent where we almost called a helicopter to get us back down. We knew we weren't lost because we knew we had to follow the creek but at the waterfalls it was just cliff. We ended up finding a non-life threatening way down but had to be slow, smart, and careful (climbing again and descending loose rocky cliff areas). We all ended up dehydrated and exhausted. If you are wanting an epic peak hike, please just do an out and back!!! Search AllTrails for just the Malans Peak Trail. The hike to Malans Peak was steep but rewarding."
87,2017-06-14,[''],knee burner on the way down. Love this trail.
88,2017-06-11,['hiking'],"At least a moderate-level trail.  Some areas of the pathway are very narrow, steep along the way up.  Awesome view at the peak; quite a few branch-offs for photos -- or just to take in the moment!"
89,2017-06-05,[''],"This is a busy,  steep hike but so worth it."
90,2017-06-04,['hiking'],"One of the harder ~5-mile hikes. There's pretty much no flat ground the entire way, which is pretty rough. I really enjoyed the two river crossing, and it was a bit tough to get our hydrophobic dog across them. The view from the top was great, but there's no shelter from the sun, so we didn't stay too long."
91,2017-06-03,[''],"Great hike going up, great run going down. Amazing views at the top!!"
92,2017-05-30,[''],"The view at the end of this hike is spectacular and worth all the hard work getting to the top.  There are not many breaks from the uphill climb from the very beginning of this hike. Compared to the last few hikes I've done that were rated moderate (Adam's canyon, Waterfall canyon and Hidden Valley) I felt that this one was significantly harder. Hiking beside the river for the first part of the trail was really beautiful too. The water is flowing fast and overruns the trail in a couple of places but not so much that you have to get wet."
93,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"Great hike. Mostly uphill, with a few switchbacks. Gopher snakes and small spiders in the bushes along the trail. The peak is highly rewarding"
94,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"So this hike marked ""Moderate"" proved to be very challenging for me as this was only my second time hiking in the mountains. I think it was the almost constant steep grade that got me the most. The trail itself is nice and loaded with beautiful photo-ops every step of the way. The view from the peak is majestic and well worth the climb. The trail is a little narrow in the switchbacks so be careful with your footing when others are passing as some of the drop offs on the climb are pretty bad. All and all I don't regret choosing this hike for #2, but wish I knew a little more on how each trail is rated in difficulty. The waterfall canyon hike is rated the same but was for me at least, much easier to complete. I recommend this hike for anyone wanting to challenge their self."
95,2017-05-29,[''],This trail was amazing and challenging! It was well worth it!!
96,2017-05-24,[''],"a nice trail, but not a lot of scenery until you get to the top. narrow path, steep switchbacks, nothing much else to it.

the view at the top is rather good, though."
97,2017-05-23,['hiking'],"***Warning***
This is a beautiful hike and very enjoyable to the but when attempting to complete the ""loop"" by going off the main trail at Malan basin to connect with waterfall canyon please be very careful as it is a much more adventurous. At times you can tell there is a trail but much of it just disappears and you are left scrambling up and down steep slopes, over, around and through heavy brush then back and forth across the creek to attempt to find what ""may"" be the trail.  We lost any semblance of a trail 1/2 way down.  We kept going and reached a point about 700-800 feet away from the top of the falls where there was nowhere left to safely go without repelling and rock climbing gear.  Going down this trail affords the opportunity to see waterfall canyon from a unique perspective but you will need to be in good physical condition with the correct equipment to be able to complete the ""loop"".  Unfortunately we had left our climbing gear at home and opted to return the way we came back to Malan Peak via the basin trail and avoid a search and rescue operation.  Enjoy and safe hiking."
98,2017-05-22,['hiking'],"I took 13 young women (ages 12-18) on this hike for girls camp certification.  We started at the top of 27th street and went left at the gate. We hiked the short distance to the bonneville shoreline trail and then followed the signs to Malan's Peak.  The first bit of this hike are alongside the creek and well shaded.  The incline is moderate.  It's beautiful and fun.  About 30 minutes into the hike you will cross a bridge.  At that point the trail gets pretty strenuous and stays that way until the top.  It took us about 35 minutes to get to the first overlook and then probably another hour to the top from there.  We had to stop every 30' or so to take a breather.  I don't consider myself too much out of shape, but as we got higher we definitely needed more rests.  The top was well worth it and the view was awesome.  Most of this hike is in the shade and the weather was perfect, but most of the girls ran out of water by the first overlook so take 2-3 bottles. All in all it took us 2.5 hours to get to the top and about 45 minutes to get back down.  Well worth it-will definitely go again!  Sunset would be awesome to watch up here."
99,2017-05-19,['hiking'],"This trail is great, but it definitely needs to be rated as difficult! While it took like 4 1/2 hrs round trip, once you cross over the bridge and head up to the peak, you start going uphill, and it doesn't stop until you reach the look out point, the Peak and the Hotel sign. It's a great trail though, next time I won't bring my kids unless we have a carrier!!"
100,2017-05-15,['hiking'],Great hike!
101,2017-05-11,[''],Loved the view. The landscape was beautiful. Constantly up hill. But so worth it.
102,2017-05-10,['hiking'],Good hike. Once you cross the creek and start the switchbacks it's a quad burner for sure.
103,2017-05-09,[''],Depending on your fitness level this trail can be tough. The path is well groomed for most of it but it does gain elevation pretty quick. After crossing the second bridge is when the difficulty starts. Most of the trail is a minimum of a 45 degree incline with some parts hitting around 60 degree. It is well worth it if you're able to sit down and enjoy the view at the peak.
104,2017-05-08,['hiking'],5/7 - Runoff flowing down the trail on the stretch to the bridge. Pretty awesome!
105,2017-05-07,[''],This was a fantastic hike. Pretty steep all the way to the top and it was lightly snowing up where. Beautiful view.
106,2017-04-30,['hiking'],"Hike to the peak was everything you could ask for in a hike this time of year. Snow capped peaks, multi-color rock formations, greenery, wildflowers & an amazing 360° view at the top. Highly recommend."
107,2017-04-24,['hiking'],still a bit of snow towards the peak but manageable.
108,2017-04-21,['hiking'],Great hike! Fantastic view!
109,2017-04-16,['hiking'],Great hike. Still snow in the shady sections near the top.
110,2017-04-13,['hiking'],During the summer it is a great trail. Plenty of shade when you get to the switchbacks. I recently went with the warm weather. As you ascend you can see bits of snow on the side and some of the trails are a bit muddy. To my surprise the last part of the hike before getting to the top was all full of snow. I had to turn back because I wasn't going to make it in my sneakers. I would wait a while longer for the paths to clear.
111,2017-03-16,['hiking'],"Great trail, pretty slick in the last quarter mile or so with the snow. Real good boots highly recommended, micro spikes would be even better."
112,2017-01-15,['hiking'],It's a shorter hike with awesome views.  The conditions up there were great; traction like microspikes make things nice but people were getting by without them.  The trail through the snow is well defined as of now.
113,2016-11-20,['hiking'],"I have hiked this trail a few times and the view at the end is so worth it! The full hike kicks my butt, but some nights I just do half of the hike to the ""faux"" peak."
114,2016-11-16,['hiking'],Great view. Well shaded in the fall.
115,2016-11-10,['hiking'],"Beautiful fall hike with the exception of being attacked by dogs. A woman had two pit bulls off leash who charged my wife and I. We kept them back with hiking poles for a few seconds. Then they split and were circling us as the owner was acting as if it was no big deal. They were barking, snarling and lunging. At this point I drew my pistol and the owner finally took the situation seriously. This situation ended with no-one being injured. Be careful up there. Our hike was not as fun as we had imagined it would have been due to a very irresponsible dog owner. We love dogs and have three of our own. The last thing I would ever want to do is shoot a dog, but I will not allow my wife or myself to be mauled by dogs.
I highly recommend this easy hike to the top otherwise. It has a beautiful scenic overlook above Ogden and the Wasatch Range."
116,2016-10-21,['hiking'],Fun if you go 1/2 mile past peak to basin you'll see remnants of the old resort.
117,2016-10-12,['hiking'],not to bad of a hike excellent view when u get to the top
118,2016-10-01,[''],"From 27th street TH to Malan's Peak is 2.4 miles one way. The trail is a 45 degree hike most of the way and there is a rocky ledge you need to scramble over for about 100 yards , there are 5 switch backs before coming out on top to Malan's peak . We continued on to Malians Basin a very easy hike down to a small bowl . There's a sign telling about the basin and if you look around you'll find an old steel steam engine pretty neat . 1.5 miles one way . 
If your really feeling great continue on following the creek bed the trail is very hard to follow , watch for small stacks of rock and Pink plastic streamers to show you the way . Bushwacking 101!!!
The trail peters out and now your on your own to find your way up the 60 degree incline upward to Mt Ogden Peak . We ran out of day light .
Shorts are great for the hike to the basin but long pants are suggested from there up .
Rattle Snakes are still out Sept 30,2016"
119,2016-09-29,[''],Very beautiful hike work the huffing and puffing to get to the top. I went when there was a large group of tourists and they were eating lunch on the peak so couldn't get a good overlook of Ogden. I would definitely do it again and I would probably go backpacking next time 
120,2016-09-26,[''],Great trail and beautiful views
121,2016-09-16,[''],"Absolutely beautiful in the fall. It's 3.5 miles to reach the peak though, so 7 miles round trip from the parking lot on 29th Street."
122,2016-09-06,[''],"This is a Hard hike for 2 miles then it turns to easy .. 
From the parking lot of north Ogden divide heading up to the ridge line . The trail is very steep , lots of roots and rocks on the trail a few switch backs but mostly just a 45 degree hike up .
Arrived at the ridge line the trail goes up the Hogs back of a very long and steep mountain , the trail is In Great condition . (Note : from here on take the trails off to the side , they go around the steep mountain .)
Heading to the left towards Ogden on each cross section , Lewis peak is a bald mountain top . 
Overlooking the Ogden valley below capturing an awesome view of Ben Lomond  Peak and Willard Peak to the north . 
You'v bagged a peak time to head back 
Round trip 11 miles"
123,2016-09-06,['hiking'],"I love this hike. It's got beautiful views and is pretty windy up on top. I would classify this one as moderate to hard. The switchbacks are kind of difficult. As with the previous review, I've never seen the hot springs either. If they are there, I'd love to know where to find them."
124,2016-09-05,[''],"Great hike, personally would classify it as hard not moderate. Never seen any hot springs, so not sure where that came from. Great view from the top, very steep climb the whole way there."
125,2016-09-01,['hiking'],i like to go back one more time because its a nice view up there you can see really close the antennas in the tip of the  mountain
126,2016-08-26,['hiking'],Definitely one of my favorite hikes. There is an amazing view at the top which makes the whole thing worth it. It was so beautiful. Very enjoyable trail all the way up.
127,2016-08-15,['hiking'],"Another pastime favorite. Avg 2 hrs for completion from start to finish, unless you decide to chill for a bit and enjoy the view, then about 3. ;)"
128,2016-07-29,[''],Beautiful. It was a good climb that had my heart racing on the way up. The views were lovely along the way and spectacular at the top. I liked that much of the trail was shaded.
129,2016-07-15,['hiking'],Awesome hike. It is well worth the view.
130,2016-07-14,['hiking'],Challenging but so much fun. The view is definitely worth it
131,2016-07-09,[''],"Beautiful hike. Moderate to hard. Coming down was hard because of the incline, narrow trail and lots of gravel. Some areas you have to scramble. Not for the faint of heart."
132,2016-07-07,[''],"I'd do it again, but the switchbacks are killer. The Utah tourism website says that anyone can make this hike if they take it slow. I hope out-of-state folks who read that will realize that ""take it slow"" means ""give yourself all day and bring a lunch"" in this case:) I thoroughly enjoyed the hike. The mountains around Ogden are always fantastic."
133,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! Definitely harder than ""moderate"". The whole hike is very uphill. The view is worth the work though and the entire hike up is beautiful."
134,2016-06-30,[''],My first time hiking this trail. It's pretty steep but a great hike. We went into Malan's Basin as well. At top watch for rattle snakes.
135,2016-06-09,['hiking'],Amazing hike with beautiful views all along the way. The top is well worth the climb. It should be rated difficult/hard not moderate as this is a very vertical hike.
136,2016-06-05,['hiking'],"Awesome trail up along the creek and then into the forest. A little hard to find your way if you’ve never done it before. Constant uphill, it can be a beast! Great view at the top, and you can continue on to Mt. Ogden if you wish."
137,2016-05-30,[''],The view at the end is worth it! Very difficult when there's still snow on the ground.
138,2009-10-09,[''],"Beautiful trail.  A short, steep (but mostly very well graded) climb through gorgeous woodlands.  I live under Malan's Peak, and enjoy looking up at a friendly mountain."
