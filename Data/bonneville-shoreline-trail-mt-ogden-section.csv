0,2019-04-18,[''],great time out today!
1,2019-04-01,"['mountain biking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'washed out']","Great single track with large fast flowy berms, short easy climb fast descent some parts were a little washed out but over all great trail."
2,2019-01-22,[''],"Just went for a walk there last friday, it was a perfect day/trail for a winter hike. The snow has been walked on enough that the trail is compacted fairly well."
3,2018-06-11,['hiking'],Beautiful.
4,2017-12-16,[''],Beautiful easy trail. I take my kids here often. It is more fun in the winter time.
5,2017-08-11,[''],I would rate this as easy and actually the first kind of boring hike I did this summer.
6,2017-05-05,[''],"We took our 2 kids ages 7 and 10. There were so many bikers that we kept having to go on the edge. If you are going as a family, I wouldn't recommend. Very busy and you have to listen for bikers because of all thebswitch backs, you can not see them. If the kids are talking too much, you won't hear them. It was however a very beautiful trail and I would do it again in a heart beat!"
7,2016-12-26,[''],Would love to come back in the Spring.
8,2016-09-29,[''],Great trail for running!! Beautiful views and a lot of ups and downs to get you sweating!
9,2016-09-06,['hiking'],"This is a good trail to prepare you for the hiking season or just to get out and enjoy the outdoors for a while. There are parts that are moderate, but nothing too hard. Many people use this trail, but it's a good one."
10,2016-09-01,[''],beautiful place ho likes the view but not a lot of shade a lot of bike's and dogs
11,2016-08-25,['hiking'],What happened to the graffiti bowl???
12,2016-06-29,['hiking'],Have done this trail several times. This path is shared by bikers and hikers which can make it crowded often. It's a good trail and the further you go the incline steadily increases.
13,2016-04-24,['mountain biking'],Great trail for an after work or early morning ride.
14,2015-05-25,[''],Great trail a little wet and slippery but overall an amazing view and an awesome experience.
15,2015-05-02,[''],"Nice, easy running trail. busy on the weekends."
16,2015-04-13,['hiking'],"Difficult trail to hike on congested days - there are a lot of bikers, and the trail is too narrow for traffic. It does provide great views, but go slow and listen for other hikers and bikers on the trail."
17,2015-04-11,['hiking'],One of my favorite places to hike when I don't have a hike in mind. You can drop in on the trail from many places. The trail offers something for everyone.
18,2012-08-24,['mountain biking'],We have run across this trail and I really want to bike it before Winter sets in.
19,2012-08-16,['hiking'],Busy trail! You have to watch for mountain bikers I would not recommend listening to your iPod in a manner so that u can't hear them coming. The trail is well kept and the views are pretty. I've been up here several times and it will take you to other trails along the way. 
20,2012-07-23,['hiking'],"This is really a bunch of trail segments rather than one continuous trail.  But in any case, one could travel the length of it from Beus Canyon on the south up until it ends near the Northern Weber County line up near pleasant view.  Highly varied, most of it pretty moderate.  Can be busy with hikers, bikers, dogs, and kids."
21,2012-06-17,['walking'],"This is a trail that is great for both bikers and hikers.  It has both moderate  and easy trails and many options to explore.  The views of the valley are amazing, and it is a fun place to get away without having to travel too far."
