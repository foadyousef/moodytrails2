0,2019-09-04,['hiking'],Hiked this today and had the hot pots all to myself although I know that’s not normal!  Very pretty hike. 
1,2019-09-01,['hiking'],Great hikes that stays along the water all the way up to the waterfall/hot springs.  Went early to beat the crowd.
2,2019-09-01,['hiking'],This was a great family friendly trail! Took our 8 and 2.5 yr old. There were a few moments that required keeping the kids close or carried due to steep cliffs/erosion although overall this trail is exceptionally maintained. Parking car can be tough and tight although we experienced no issues. The water was great and for the most part the trail and springs were clean. Can’t wait to do it again and go a little further.
3,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Nice mix of sun and shade on the trail and plenty of opportunities to take a dip in the stream that runs adjacent to the trail.  It was great to cool off under the waterfall at the end and take a relaxing soak in the hot springs.  
4,2019-08-27,['hiking'],"nice. hike with mixture of sun and shade
"
5,2019-08-26,[''],This is an awesome trail. The hike itself meanders along rushing water throughout its 4+ mile out and back moderate run. There are plenty of hike-in tenting sites and spots to cool off in the water before you get to the grand finale...several hot spring pools and a beautiful cool waterfall.  There are some horseflies at the top - but they seem to be fairly easily deterred by bug spray. If you don’t like the smell of sulphur the top of the trail may cause discomfort!  Water shoes a great idea!! 
6,2019-08-19,['hiking'],Groovy hike.   Hot springs are relaxing.  Might not want the young ones being the first to the pools or you could have an educational conversation on your hands when they see “Buffy and the Skinny Dippers.”   Usually not a problem on the weekends. 
7,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","We really loved this hike. It is kind of up and down the whole way out and back. The parking is a bit tight- especially since we arrived at 12:30 on a Saturday. I would recommend that you either wear or pack water type shoes- the rocks are not comfy in your feet in the pools. Also, take your water as some spots are sunny and leash your dogs pls. Horse flies are a pain at the top- deep woods spray made them stay away. "
8,2019-08-16,['hiking'],"Great hike! We carried a baby and toddler with 5, 7, and 9 year olds walking. Very doable, intermediate hike for kids/family.  Beautiful scenery-trail, river, pools, falls. Passed several groups, but not overly crowded. didn't encounter any nudity. and no horse flies when we went (6:30-9:30 pm). nice and cool, pretty shady trail. a bit smelly and humid at the top, but that was not a deterrent for us. so fun to throw our heads in the waterfall. loved it, will def go again!"
9,2019-08-15,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","Not my favorite trail, and I usually fall in love with all of them. But as soon as you hit the bridge you get this smell and it gets stronger as you get closer to the springs and once you’re there the smell is pretty strong. I understand it’s the springs but no one mentioned it and it would of been nice to know this. But other than that it was beautiful. Didn’t get swamped by the horse flies. We stared up the hike around 8 am got back at 11, Lots of butterflies. "
10,2019-08-14,"['hiking', 'rocky']","I would rate this an easy to moderate trail. It is very rocky, but not too steep. The trail was beautiful and along the river most of the time. The hot springs were really pretty and warm. We hiked up there about 9:00 a.m on a Saturday and there weren’t too many people. We hiked down about 11:30 and there were tons of people headed that way. The earlier the better! 
My only complaint is the horse flies! They were VICIOUS! Wear bug spray.
Oh! And be careful with jewelry in the hot springs! I was wearing 2 silver rights and they are completely ruined. :( the water did something to them. "
11,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'bugs']","The hike up was awesome!! For some reason we got attacked by man eating flies (horse flies) on the way back. It was less enjoyable on the way down because the bites were awful. Crowded, but not to bad. There was someone who decided to get naked up stream which was not ok. Other than that it was amazing and worth the two hour drive. The water was still pretty muddy from the land slides. "
12,2019-08-09,"['hiking', 'rocky']",This trail is absolutely beautiful! And the springs were so fun to sit in. There’s a nice cold waterfall if the springs are too hot for you. I would recommend bringing water shoes or sandals to walk around in the water because of the rocks. Pretty moderate trail.
13,2019-08-07,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Well worth the hike! A perfect hike for young and old. Our party was from 18 to 67 and we had no issue. Bring lots of water on hot days and wear bathing suites. There are at least 5 pools of warm water and a great falls (quite refreshing). We spent 2 hours in the water and really enjoyed it.
Expect 1.5 hours to hike up and about 1 hour down.
Tons of biting horseflies, so keep moving. Once in the pools they leave you alone."
14,2019-08-06,"['hiking', 'bugs']","This was a great hike with both shady and sunny spots. Easy in and out not too steep with minimal rocky parts. If you are going in the afternoon, in August, such as I just did bring plenty of water. There were horse flys everywhere so be ready to stay in the water once you hit the springs. They were as described. People have put up rocks to create small pools where the temperatures fluctuate. It was beautiful and calm. "
15,2019-08-06,['hiking'],My group and I had a really good time hiking this trail. It was pretty unique at the end with the waterfall and the spring. Pretty easy hike overall for someone who casually exercises. Didn’t have much difficulty. Taking a dip on and off kept us cool as well! Beautiful hike. 
16,2019-08-05,['hiking'],beautiful trail watch out for the deer flies they bite 
17,2019-08-04,['hiking'],Beautiful desert oasis. 
18,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'muddy']","We got caught in a summertime rainstorm today.  Pretty good amount of rain too. It made the trail muddy, and full of puddles. Of course my dog had to go through every puddle, so clean up at the truck was fun. Because it was overcast and raining when we reached the hot pools and waterfall, the colors of the pools were not super awesome. We'll go back again and hope for no rain si the pools are clear. "
19,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'rocky']","This was a very fun trail. It was a little rocky, but worth it at the end with the hot springs. The hot springs are 100% worth it. Wear your swimming suit and take a towel."
20,2019-07-31,['hiking'],This hike is one of my favorites. Relatively easy uphill to the springs then downhill on the way back. The hot springs and waterfall at the end are absolutely magical. Bring water and a snack because you’ll want to get 2 or 3 hours for frolicking *at* the hot springs. The hike itself takes 40 min to 1.5 hours getting there depending on your pace. We were strolling and taking our time absorbing the stream sounds and cool rock sights. Can be slightly slippery when it rains. Makes sure to explore all of the different pools. They have varying temperatures.
21,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"Great hike along water entire way! ! Was easy for 12/13 year old sons. We packed bathing suits for the hot tubs. Saw a snake, but not a harmful one near the water. Lots of people on a Sunday, but was very enjoyable- good shade along the path! "
22,2019-07-28,['hiking'],I would recommend this hike for people who want something scenic and moderate. I’m usually scared of scary drop offs but there are barriers that prevent you from falling. It’s my favorite hike so far! 
23,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']","So worth it... if you get there before the crowds start pouring in. Thankfully, we took the advice of some of the previous reviews and started the trail super early. We got to the hot springs around 8am and had the entire place to ourselves for over an hour. So damn magical. The 1st pool is like lukewarm bath water. Really refreshing. The 2nd pool is like a super hot bath. The kind where your skin stings for awhile until you get used to it. Still super nice but overwhelming after being in it for awhile. The 3rd (closest to the waterfall) is really fucking hot. I couldn’t be in it at all. But recommend testing them all out! It’s wild to feel the mix of super cold river water with the hot spring water. Make sure to dunk your head into the waterfall! 

Highly recommend this short hike! Start early. The crowds started showing up around 10/10:30am and that was the time we decided to head out. 

Also, PICK UP YOUR TRASH. We hauled out three bags of trash that we collected in and around the springs. Super sad and disrespectful."
24,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite trails ever. Whether you find the hot springs at the end underwhelming or not, the trail alone is worth the drive from SLC (the drive on diamond fork road is pretty cool in itself.) beautiful river valley and mountain views throughout. A good climb but not overwhelming. we went on a Friday afternoon. Overall light traffic. The springs were pretty neat or at least the idea of them is. I personally couldn’t stomach the prospect of flesh eating bacteria or smelling like egg salad for the rest of my life enough to go more than shin deep. The river through the hot springs is nice and cool and clear (and moving) though. "
25,2019-07-25,['hiking'],The hike was busy but beautiful. We even saw a white mountain goat during the hike. At the end we enjoyed soaking in the hot springs and playing in the waterfall.
26,2019-07-22,['hiking'],I would say definitely bring crampons if you go in the winter. The trail is heavily trafficked and will become an ice slide!
27,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",
28,2019-07-19,['hiking'],"Parking is a little limited, so don’t be surprised if you don’t get a parking spot right away. The hike was beautiful and decently shaded. We hiked this trail in early May and saw roughly 5 other people. It gets pretty busy around mid May until late August."
29,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"I would give it 5 stars but as someone else stated , too many people. Other than that I thought it was a beautiful hike up to the falls . Get there early as possible. The parking lot is small . "
30,2019-07-12,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
31,2019-07-09,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",great hike for kids!
32,2019-07-09,['hiking'],"Groovy Hike.  Hot springs are relaxing.  Might not want the kids to be the first to the ones to the end or you could have an interesting educational talk on your hands when they see ""Buffy and the Skinny Dippers.""  You can usually avoid this on the weekends."
33,2019-07-08,['hiking'],"It's about 60 minutes to reach the top waterfall from the Trailhead. Shaded for good portion of the hike.  We started the trail at 4pm only saw one small gopher snake by the first (lower) hot pot. 
I will definitely hike this trail again, maybe take a hammock and lounge out longer next time.
*Please remember to bring a garbage bag with you if you're going to be packing in anything.
We cleaned up a pile of beer and soda cans at the top hot pots that someone left behind. It would be such a shame if this beautiful hike was trashed by careless, lazy people. 
If you pack it in - pack it out. "
34,2019-07-07,['hiking'],This was our first time doing this hike. We showed up to a completely packed parking lot with ppl still trying to pack in spots vehicles didn’t fit and block others in... I dropped everyone off and drove down the road to the next available place to park and ran back. The stream was pretty and the trail had some shade but not a ton. We got to the hot springs and it was just flooded with ppl everywhere... trash everywhere... we came across a few dead gopher snakes ppl had just killed for no reason. Overall it could be a pretty place but in my opinion ppl have ruined it. Not the type of hike I enjoy personally. 
35,2019-07-01,['hiking'],We started hiking around 6:30 p.m. on a Monday evening with several teens and kids ages 5-18. The trail was amazing and the rushing creek was so beautiful. My 5-year old and 7-year old did great but were pretty tired by the end. We did see four large Gopher Snakes directly on the trail. Upon arriving at the large waterfall there was a group of about 6-8 fully nude bathers in full sunlight which was a bit frustrating being there with children. We stayed below at the other pools. As we started to leave a lot of other groups came up. It's a busy place!
36,2019-06-24,['hiking'],Easy picturesque hike. Beautiful area. I was amazed and disappointed at how much trash people left. Please pack out what you pack in.
37,2019-06-24,[''],"hike up takes about 45-60 min. Beautiful hike! You will see snakes on warm sunny days. The pools were great and most can be tweaked. If to hot, find a way to direct the cold water in, if too cold, find where the cold water is coming in and slow it down. Locals go up frequently to help improve the pools.
yes, you'll likely run into naked people, especially if you go early or late in the day. But if you are nice and respectful in how you talk to them, most are willing to put shorts or underwear on if you are uncomfortable.
There is a hidden pool that a local pointed me too. If you find it, don't be surprised if you run into naked people. Because it's more secluded, it seems to be used more frequently by skinny dippers.
I'd definitely go again! Next time I'll backpack in and camp somewhere on the trail."
38,2019-06-20,"['hiking', 'washed out']","My boyfriend, roommate and I hiked in around sunset this past Thursday night. We brought our camp gear, hoping to go to the springs really late or really early in order to have a spring to ourselves. We discovered there was over 20 people at the springs still at sunset, so we settled on the furthest pool, upstream of the waterfall. We had the pool to ourselves for about an hour, but were joined by a few bros. We left shortly after, and camped nearby. We noticed people hiking in towards the hot springs all hours of the night, well past midnight. We woke up around 5am the next morning, and still spotted people hiking in towards the springs. We decided to pack up early and head home, deciding that we most likely weren't going to have any private moments at these springs. The hike was easy and absolutely beautiful, and the river was bursting with fresh snowmelt. The waterfall and springs were super cool, but just very very crowded. For those seeking for backcountry springs and a little solitude, this site is not for you. For a quick dunk in the spring 30 minutes away from the city with a bunch of other folks? That sounds more accurate for what you should expect."
39,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Absolutely loved this hike. Very well shaded. You walk right next to the river the whole time. Great resting spots. Such an easy hike. But it does get very busy. And there is no parking spots. The pots were beautiful & warm! The waterfall is full! Enjoyed every moment! 
40,2019-06-13,['hiking'],"So pretty, walk along the river the whole way, lots of shade, perfect lunch spot by the river at the half way mark, good tree for c to climb, so many snakes, three good places to pee"
41,2019-06-12,['hiking'],Very easy. Best to get there early and watch the sun peak through the woods. Be sure to talk to the Keeper of the Realm. He is often seen naked in the second pool carrying a pick axe. My understanding is that he keeps the pools running well. Chat with him for safe passage to the best of the pools.
42,2019-06-11,['hiking'],Great trail for the family! 
43,2019-06-09,['hiking'],"A beautiful and easy trail. A lot of wildflowers and a constant following a steam hike. Easy for the whole family. I also recommend going early on a Sunday before 10am. The parking lot gets full fast so park where it can be easy to get out. Bring a towel and water shoes, with a letter or two of water. Have fun, we had great discussions with many people. "
44,2019-06-08,['rocky'],"Worth it. The trail is uphill nearly all the way and my little was nearly done toward the end, but the falls and hot springs are beautiful and worth the trek. There are 3 sections of hot springs with the coolest being the first. The second of springs are up a little further and much warmer and near the first falls. Nice mix of hot and cold there. If you proceed past the first fall, there's another spring and a much taller fall that is spectacular, but much more difficult to get to. I didn't bring my little up that way. It's a sulphur spring, so there is an intense smell, but the experience is amazing. There weren't many people there. We started the hike around 4pm and by the time we got there it wasn't crowded. We did pass tons of people hiking out on our way in though. My recommendation is to avoid 10am-5pm."
45,2019-06-07,['hiking'],"Normally one of my favorite hikes. Except yesterday, a guy with barely a t shirt wrapped around his waist barged past my wife and I so that he could be naked in one of the pools that we were clearly making our way to. I told him he better be covered when we got there, to which he got snotty and rude. Then another pool had a naked guy in it, but at least he was nice. That unfortunately left only a very shallow, extremely hot pool left, that was hard to enjoy. "
46,2019-06-06,['hiking'],We did this 1st week of June! Great weather & was a good hike. The prettiest spring at the top was occupied by a very loving couple. LOL. But it was a good one & the canyon was so green!  Easy to follow trail
47,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
48,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"Nice easy hike, Beautiful views, A lot of people You’re most likely going to have to park off the street instead of parking lot also the bathrooms were disgusting. "
49,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"Highly recommend, hot springs are awesome! Show up early to beat the crowds, as we were leaving around 11:30 a bunch of ppl were hiking in and parking lot was full. We started the hike at 8 am and only ran into 4 people. It took us 1 hour to hike in and 45 min to hike out. "
50,2019-05-26,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Went in the hike this morning. We got to the parking lot around 8AM on a Sunday and there were probably 10-15 parkings left. Bathrooms available at the trailhead. Easy hike. Did it in Chacos. Only about 4-5 other people at the hot springs when we got there. So we got ample time to hang in the springs and take photos. By 9:45/10:00, a huge surge of people came. It was packed after that! Tons of families and big groups. No way you’d be getting photos on your own. The waterfalls are strong, so only a few main pools open. Awesome hike overall!!"
51,2019-05-26,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Trail had elevation but still shallow enough to run parts of it. Beautiful scenery, totally worth the length and don’t forget a swimsuit for the hot springs!"
52,2019-05-26,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Very easy trail but highly trafficked. Once you get to the springs there are a ton of people but it’s really pretty and worth the hike!
53,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
54,2019-05-22,['hiking'],"Aug 2018. The trail was sort of rough and steep in places, but manageable. The hot springs were beautiful! The scenery was stunning as well. There was plenty of shade and plenty of places to sit and take a rest. 

The downsides were that there were A LOT of people at the hot springs, even though we went super early specifically to AVOID people (it was like 7am on a weekday), and that the hot springs were full of algae that gives a really gross slimy texture to the bottom of the pools, etc. so if you're thinking of taking a dip and have texture issues like me, maybe reconsider. "
55,2019-05-19,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","It’s a decent hike, the hot springs are worth it. The mineral smell is awful but still made for a great Saturday. "
56,2019-05-19,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
57,2019-05-18,['hiking'],In response to Diane Marion. There a few camping spots before and after the springs. All about 1/4 mile away from the springs. The biggest and closest one to the springs is spacious and backs up to the river. Great idea! Should be fun for all. 
58,2019-05-18,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
59,2019-05-17,['hiking'],"This is not a review but a question for those who had the opportunity to experience what looks like an incredible place! - 
I am planning a trip through Utah's NPs May 17-26. Would love to hike out to the hot springs and camp there to have a really early morning soak. Is this something that can be done at Fifth Water Hot Springs? If so, are there plenty of spaces to camp assuming many others may have the same idea as well?
Thank you in advanced!"
60,2019-05-16,['hiking'],Trail was in good condition which was nice with all the rain the last few weeks. The hot springs were great and the scenery was beautiful. It was pretty crowded when we went (a Wednesday evening) but we still had a good time. The hike isn’t difficult at all and definitely worth it. 
61,2019-05-08,['hiking'],
62,2019-05-07,['hiking'],"Nice and easy trail.  A tree fell down on the day I went, but the trail wasn’t impacted too much.  Some tight spots  to be wary of, especially if hiking after dark.  River is cold and is running pretty fast, but does not impact getting to the springs too much.  Springs felt very nice."
63,2019-05-06,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, dogs loved it. Lots of people at the springs as expected."
64,2019-04-28,['hiking'],"You feel AMAZING after sitting in the hot water springs, so highly recommend it! Fairly easy hike. You hike alongside the water all the way up to hot springs."
65,2019-04-28,['hiking'],"I really loved this trail. It was partly shaded and the river ran along the entire thing. It was well maintained. 
Keep your dogs and kids close as the river is running really fast right now. A dog got swept into the river but was ok.
Parking is a bit of a mess so be prepared to wait it out for a spot if you go on the weekend. Bathrooms were disgusting. 
Hot springs were a cool bonus to the hike, I didn’t go in but they are warm and I didn’t see the garbage the other posts mentioned."
66,2019-04-26,[''],"great hike..agree with other folld..a bit dirty at the top near the springs...upsetting to see shirts, towels and cans up there... what happened to #leavenotrace"
67,2019-04-24,[''],Went there on April 19th with my friends. It's a very good hike and would encourage this for beginners too. Its about 4mile hike in total but worth it once you reach the falls. Make sure you have fun at the falls and the hot springs!
68,2019-04-24,['hiking'],"Amazing trail that's clear of snow at this time 4/20/19.  The Spanish Fork River is raging at this time and I imagine in a couple weeks that portions of the trail may become submerged with water as the river is already within an inch of portions of the trail.   Went early in the morning and was met with 5 nudes at the springs (1st time in 6 visits), making picture taking hard but the falls were awesome.   Due to the excessive water flow,  all the water was super muddy and lacked its picturesqueness of blues and green, but definitely worth the trip."
69,2019-04-23,['hiking'],"I absolutely loved this hike and so did my 15lb Jack Russel mix. She did it with ease as well. The pools weren't crowded however they was a nude bather the moment I showed up...who stayed nude while greeting me and making small talke... I being a male and she a female I then gave her space and went to the furthest pool only to find a couple being intimate. Let's just say I felt out of place and went back down and found the first lady had dressed and was readying to leave. So, I took over her spot. It was so warm and awesome. Although not a deep pool near the fall I still enjoyed it immensely. What a great day even in the light rain!"
70,2019-04-22,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'washed out']","Did this trail Easter Sunday, and it was a perfect day! It is definitely more pretty in the late summer/fall season because right now everything is still pretty brown and muddy. But none the less, great trail. The hot pools are beautiful, and worth it. There are nude bathers tho, so beware."
71,2019-04-21,['hiking'],"This is usually one of my favorite hikes. But today there were A LOT of SNAKES! We saw 5 including a rattlesnake. I HATE SNAKES!! and even snakes down by the pools. Be Careful. 

On the upside the wild flowers are beautiful right now. "
72,2019-04-20,['hiking'],Easy track. Not really beautiful this particular season. Good if u have nothing to do!!
73,2019-04-20,['hiking'],"Great place. Really busy, definitely worth the hike"
74,2019-04-13,"['muddy', 'rocky']","hike too easy for my level of skill, so definitely kid friendly.  dog friendly aswell.  springs were a little hot, but very relaxing. 

Camping spots litter the side of the trail up to about 200 yards from the springs.  go for it"
75,2019-04-12,['hiking'],nice easy hike with a great reward. almost all the snow is gone now
76,2019-04-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","This was a beautiful trail. There was still some snow and ice but it didn’t impose too much on the trail. If you bring littles I would be careful there are a few spots that are extremely narrow. I didn’t get into the springs, but several people did and it seemed enjoyable:)"
77,2019-04-05,"['hiking', 'snow']","This was a beautiful hike and the hot springs were the perfect temperature in spring when mixed with the snow melt.

I hiked it 04/04/19 and there were still very slick patches of ice along the trail."
78,2019-04-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","The gate was open yesterday when we went. Beautiful hike with all the snow. There was still a lot of slush and snow on the trail. We want to do this every season to see how it changes. There are some spots where there’s a bit of a drop off to the river below, keep your little ones close."
79,2019-03-31,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']","Great hike! Easy to follow and not technical. Rated as moderate and I agree, the elevation gain going up made it moderate, but very doable. Beautiful scenery and love the sound of river as you are walking all the way up. Good tree coverage providing shading throughout. This time of the year, there was some snow and ice still on the trail, at times muddy since it’s been getting warmer during the days. The waterfall was beautiful and the hot springs were fantastic. Parking can be challenging because it’s a small parking area, so be sure to get there early. We had to park outside of the 1st gate, so we had to walk the extra 1.3 miles (one way) to get to the trailhead. Use the three forks trailhead to get to the hot springs, once you pass the map signage at the trailhead, stay left on the trail and follow it up to the waterfall and hot springs. One last note, sadly we noticed some trash throughout the trail, please remember to pack out what you brought in, in order to keep this natural beauty as it is, for everyone to enjoy it as you did. Enjoy!"
80,2019-03-29,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Trail was beautiful and enjoyable (minus the snow slush but that's a seasonal thing and our own fault for not preparing for it). The hot springs themselves were nice and warm however also a little gross with the sludge. The sulfur smell wasn't easy to stand at times (at least for me) but you get used to it and it's all a part of the experience. 
We went on a weekday and didn't have too much trouble parking. 
All in all it was a great trail and beautiful scenery that I'd visit again."
81,2019-03-28,"['hiking', 'muddy']","The springs at the end are so cool! It is really neat to find them so close to SLC. Word of warning: there are no good markings or signs to show you to the trail. The gate is closed still so it is probably about 1.5 miles to get to the trailhead. once you see the second gate, turn right into the parking area. There is a sign that says ""three forks trailhead"" - this is the trailhead you want! I got confused because I was looking for a different trailhead name and kept going straight on the road for like an extra mile before realizing I was not on track. Once you get to the trailhead, it says it is 2.2 miles to the springs but it feels much farther than that. It took us over an hour to reach the springs from the actual trailhead and we hike pretty fast. The end is worth it though. The green pool is warmest but was pretty full of people at midday on a weekday. Some slushy spots so YakTrax helped."
82,2019-03-19,"['hiking', 'snow']","This is one of the most beautiful trails I’ve ever hiked! I have only done it in the winter. The bright blue waters next to the snow make for amazing pictures. The hike is challenging in some spots, but there is so much beauty around you, you’ll barley notice. And once you get to the end of the trail you’re rewarded by the warm hot springs! So fun and worth it! All over AMAZING."

85,2019-03-12,"['hiking', 'snow']",Awesome hike!! Not too crowded on a weekday late morning. Closed gate added about an extra mile each way. Hot springs were so nice and definitely worth the hike. Hiking out mid afternoon was super slushy. We were good in snow boots but yak tracks would’ve been better. Super dog friendly.
86,2019-03-10,"['hiking', 'snow']","Did this hike in early March and gate was still closed and the parking lot was almost full when I arrived at 10am on a Saturday.  There was a sign indicating 'No Parking' near of the gate, but the sign only said no parking on the road between the gate and trailhead.

Overall, the snow on the trail was well packed and easy to follow. I would definitely recommend sandals if you plan on getting in the pools. My only was complaint was how busy the trail got, especially on the return trip."
87,2019-03-04,['hiking'],If you go to this hike and the winter gate is closed please send me a picture of the gate and if you see any signs saying no parking on street to compmrklein@msn.com the. Sheriff claims there are no parking signs thanks in advance
88,2019-02-24,['hiking'],Fun trail in the winter but some spots are super slick. A lot of people and super dog friendly!
89,2019-02-18,['hiking'],"The parking is an issue. So either go on a week day or super super super early.  We got there at 7:45 and the lot was full. 
BEAUTIFUL and easy hike. 
The hot springs are at the base of the waterfall. Hot! the pools get cooler as get further away. 
Saw a, what we believe to be, wandering garter snake."
90,2019-02-17,['hiking'],Add an extra 1.2 miles from where the gate is closed to the trailhead. All in all a very pleasant hike with a reward or hot pools at the top!
91,2019-02-17,['hiking'],"2/17/19 LOST a GoPro on the trail!!! Most likely very close to the pools. Please please please return if found!!! It was a birthday gift less than one year ago. I am devastated. There aren't any photos on it, but maybe a short accidental video clip. It was so cold we didn't use it. The pools are shallow and much cooler than normal. If you park on the street (usually parking is full) you will most likely get a ticket. Everyone on the road had one on the windshield when we got back from the springs. 

If you find a GoPro, we have the serial number and can identify it by a specific detail. Call or text 701-710-1640!"
92,2019-02-11,[''],This is such a beautiful trail with all of the recent snow. It was pretty packed down so all I needed were my snow boots. We found a pool near the top that was the perfect temperature.
93,2019-02-07,['hiking'],"This trail was amazing and worth the extra miles due to the gate being closed. I went twice last week — the first time was packed down snow which was easy to hike on, the next day it was slush, ice, and mud. Yaktrax were a life saver as we saw many people on the trail slipping and sliding both days."
94,2019-01-28,"['hiking', 'snow']","#DoGoMore this place is awesome we went up on a Saturday morning around 11am and the gate was closed but from the gate to the trailhead was only about 1.5 miles and sooooooo worth it. 

The trail was absolutely beautiful, you follow the river all the way up and with the snow cover it is quite amazing. It is also pretty easy even with the snow. I took my 12 and 10 year old and they had a great time. 

Now for the best part, the springs, I expected it to be crazy busy but it wasn’t bad at all and plenty of room for everyone, most people stop at the springs by the waterfall but there are more above the waterfall too. Some pools are hotter than others so you’ll have to feel them out to find what you like. 

THINGS TO BRING: towels, change of clothes, extra pair of socks and a plastic bag for wet clothes. OPTIONAL THINGS TO BRING: shoes or flip flops to wear in the water some of the rocks get pretty sharp. I promise you that even with the extra mile and a half it’s worth it."
95,2019-01-20,"['hiking', 'snow']","This is a must-see! Bring: towels, a bag for wet clothes, spikes for shoes, dry socks and underwear/bra to change into. Wear: your bathing under your clothes and hiking boots!

The actual road to the trailhead is gated off due to snow. The hike ends up being about 3.8 miles there and 3.8 back. We started at 3 in the afternoon and made it to the springs by 4:30 (about 1.5 hours hike) hopped in the springs for a bit and made our way back in the dark. 

The springs have several different pools with varying temperatures. We were in the one closest to the little water fall at the end of the trail and it felt like it was a hundred degrees! We loved it and so glad we had a chance to experience this place.

This trail is super snowy currently and some places are slick and muddy. I highly recommend good hiking boots with plenty of traction. We stopped by Walmart and picked up towels and those over-the-shoe spikes and they really helped. The hike back in the dark was really icy in some spots (thank goodness we packed a headlamp). A few people tagged along with us on the way back and they were in running shoes and slipped and fell down several times."
96,2019-01-17,[''],Very busy!
97,2019-01-14,['hiking'],"The trail was snow packed and beautiful! It was easily doable without spikes or snowshoes! The gate was closed 1.5 miles out from the trailhead, but was a beautiful hike! Prepare yourself to have a towel and dry clothes when you get out of the springs!"
98,2018-12-30,[''],"Beautiful hike!! We did this hike on Christmas Eve and, at that point, the gate was closed adding an additional 1.5 miles to the trailhead. I would highly recommend yak tracks, spikes, snow shoes or something to help with traction. Most the of the hike is icy and I can’t really imagine doing it without them. The hike itself (with spikes) was relatively easy, only a small elevation gain. Pack a lunch, you burn enough calories that you’ll be hungry at the end. The hot springs are beautiful and so much fun! We wore out suits in under our clothes, brought flip flops, towel, and plastic bags to put our suits in on the way back. Highly recommend this hike!"
99,2018-12-25,[''],Very fun hike. We brought our bikes to ride from the gate to trailhead. Our family of 2 adults and 4 kids (ages 8-16) loved it. It was slippery in parts but didn’t require any special equipment besides good hiking shoes. It was a great Christmas Eve family activity!
100,2018-12-22,['hiking'],"GATE CLOSED!  Beautiful trail with almost exactly three additional miles of road walking before the trailhead since the gate is closed.  This actually makes it a nice long hike (for our family of four anyway) and adds some beautiful vistas -- red rocks on one side, snowy mountains on the other -- blue skies in between, at least on the walk back for us today.  This trail is ICY and very slippery in several spots.  I highly recommend spikes.  We didn't have them and busted our butts a few times before we just began sitting down and ""jeans sledding"" instead.  (Super fun activity as well, but slowed down the hike a great deal -- and can't be done uphill.)  The hot springs, of course, make this trail.  Today we stayed in the water for an hour -- hopping pool to pool in one of the lower areas -- and soaked our aching bums a good long time.  :-)  Bring water, a snack and definitely spikes for your shoes in the winter -- or at least a hiking pole that you can chop up the iciest spots with or cover with mud and leaves.  Go and enjoy!"
101,2018-12-11,['hiking'],"Probably one of my favorite hikes in Utah. The gate is closed... BUT! It’s not like last year when the gate was closed (13 miles total) now it only adds about 3 miles overall. So it’s about a 7-8 miles total. For the first timers if you want to make the trip faster I’d HIGHLY recommend bringing a couple bicycles and a good lock. You can bike the first mile and a half.There were about 20 or so people up there when we got to the springs at 2 pm. I’d definitely recommend spikes for the hike. Some parts are hard packed snow/ice. You can do it in just shoes tho. Don’t leave your trash up there and be respectful. Also, expect to see some nudity. Welcome to the wilderness "
102,2018-12-05,['hiking'],"12/4/2018 GATE IS CLOSED

Hike it anyway if you can. So amazing. Super easy hike, not sure why this is rated moderate. We hiked 2 days after a full day of snow and had no problems in regular waterproof hiking boots. There were two small parts that were slightly slick, but really, no big deal to get past. We're from Florida, so not expert snow hikers or anything. So glad we showed up to try this hike after being slightly worried from previous reviews. The path is basically a snow covered sidewalk. And the springs are great!"
103,2018-11-28,[''],What a beautiful walk. Did this 27th November. The snow made it all look like a wonderland and even more reason to stay in the hot springs longer when it’s cold outside. Beware we wore walking boots but the trail was very icy and slippery in places so we were sliding and a few falls along the way. Would definitely recommend spikes!! The springs were super warm and was only 3/4 other people there. Would recommend bringing waterproof shoes/sandals just for when your in the pools. The hike isn’t too changing and took us about an hour to get there and 50 mins on the way back.
104,2018-11-26,['hiking'],"Hiked Nov. 25, gate was still open and road to the trailhead was fine (with a couple of short icy spots). Awesome hike, but would definitely recommend chains or spikes for your shoes (a hiking pole at the very least). I was wearing chains and I still wiped out a few times on the icy trail, and I saw a lot of people in tennis shoes struggling a LOT to get up and downhill. Don't forget to take off any jewelry before soaking.. I forgot to take my rings off and they turned black from the sulphur almost immediately. Also saw a couple of nude bathers.. they weren't bothering anyone, but just be aware."
105,2018-11-17,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail veterans day. The gate was still open. parking lot says three forks tailhead, but it's for fifth hotsprings. there's a restroom in the Parking lot. come early. By 1 the Parking lot is crowded. I started at 10:30 and it was 28 degrees. Beautiful hike. lightly dusted with snow. springs were beautiful, not crowded and warm. trail is easy to find, but I had no cell service so be prepared. enjoy!"

107,2018-11-09,[''],"Great, pretty easy hike in November.  It was more crowded than we expected for a Thursday in November. The water felt great.  Several cows were in the area when we got to the springs (but not too close to the water, thank goodness!) Parking lot was over full when we got back to the trailhead after 1 pm."
108,2018-11-07,[''],is the gate closed yet?
109,2018-11-04,[''],Super fun trail 100% recommend
110,2018-11-04,['hiking'],Road to trailhead was still open today. Beautiful but busy day. More than enough space in the hot springs for everyone. Excellent moderate hike.
111,2018-11-04,[''],is the road to the trailhead still open? I know they close it once the weather turns then it is closed til spring.
112,2018-11-01,[''],Better than I expected!! Beautiful scenery every step of the way:))
113,2018-10-27,[''],
114,2018-10-24,['hiking'],"Very good trail, scenic and oh so beautiful.  I went to the springs alone.  I had a good time soaking, but I think it would be better to have a small group of friends, so I'd suggest you bring some people whose company you enjoy.  I went at around 3 pm on Tuesday and there were only about 3 other groups of people so not overcrowded at all.  I felt a little awkward soaking alone, but everyone was friendly and didn't seem to mind my dog having a soak as well."
115,2018-10-23,[''],"Great trail from the Rays Valley T.H. (east side entrance). Low water flow, but still nice. 
Diamond Fork T.H. is open contrary to what this site says.
Soaked for an hour, very enjoyable!"
116,2018-10-21,['hiking'],"Open today as well! We arrived around 9:30am Sunday morning, only a few cars in the parking lot.  We soaked for 3 hours and around 12:30/1:00 people were coming in so quickly.  We passed about 10 groups hiking up, and the parking lot was CRAZY FULL.

So advice?

Don’t forget water shoes! 
There’s lots of little hot pools above the waterfall.
Arrive early morning.
We saw a few nude people (but it wasn’t bothersome or annoying, they were alone in nature)
A few broken glass bottles which is so annoying because the pool bottoms are soft and stepping onto glass would be so bad."
117,2018-10-19,[''],"Diamond Fork road wasn’t closed this morning, had the springs to myself for almost an hour."
118,2018-10-12,[''],"i went sunday. the alternate route is from sheeps creek road. about 10-15 miles past diamond fork. once you make the left on sheeps creek road, another 11 miles of windy road. trailhead is on the left. you can see my recording to get an idea of where you start. hope this helps"
119,2018-10-07,[''],Steven-how do you get to the alternate trail??
120,2018-10-05,[''],"Called the ranger station and diamond fork was still closed, she didn’t know when they would reopen it. So I went and used the alternate trail. Very steep and strenuous compared to the normal trail, but still did it in about an hour each way. Had the whole place to myself, but water levels are low in all the pools, and the river was nice and muddy today. I posted pictures too in case anybody wants to see."
121,2018-10-04,[''],"The road was closed as of a couple days ago due to fire related things. If you must know, call the Spanish fork ranger station and inquire if the diamond fork road is open again yet or not."
122,2018-10-04,[''],So the ‘trail’ is closed? Or the gate for the road is closed? I’ve hiked to it when the gate was closed.
123,2018-10-03,['hiking'],Those anyone know if  the trail is open now?
124,2018-10-01,[''],Trail is still closed as of Oct. 1st due to the fires. I'm not sure how to find updates. The fire wasn't listed on the map.
125,2018-09-30,[''],"FYI trail currently CLOSED related to fire. 
I only gave 5 star so it wouldn’t drop the rating.
Plan to come back another time"
126,2018-09-22,[''],"Don't go. Gross, tons of people who bring their kids and pets to run around and splash and scream in the water."
127,2018-09-12,['hiking'],"This hike was absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend it but I would try to go later in the day so that you can cool off while soaking in the hot springs. This was also a great hike for someone from out of state (Missouri) as it wasn’t too steep and felt as though I was hiking in Missouri (but better lol). We did see a lot of snakes while on this trail so be careful (but none were venomous). Also, the trail looks like it got washed away a little bit so be careful as it’s gravely and large washouts on the trail itself. 
Trail: 5 stars
Difficulty: easy to moderate
Drive to trailhead: very easy paved road"
128,2018-09-05,[''],"Love these hot springs. Especially beautiful in the fall. Avoid visiting them on a holiday though, if you enjoy solitude...way too many people visit the area on holidays to allow the outing to be enjoyable in my opinion."
129,2018-08-08,[''],We arrived at 9am on a Tuesday and there were 4 cars in the lot. After a very pleasant 2 mile hike we arrived at the springs and had them to ourselves for 45 minutes.  That is all the time we needed due to persistent horse flies. The lowest pool felt like a 92f hot tub. It was most splendid and strange to have a hot waterfall jet falling on my back. The hike in and out is very nice due to the flowing stream. We were all very glad we took this amazing hike.
130,2018-08-08,['hiking'],"Great trail. Easy and fun! Go early, trail gets busy as the day goes on but we had the springs to ourselves before noon. Stop at the first pool you see! It has a mini waterfall and it’s the best of the pools. Once it’s filled, you won’t be getting in. Bring water shoes and bug spray! Horseflies are bad! Great natural hot springs, it’s a sight to see!"
131,2018-08-06,['hiking'],loved the water
132,2018-08-05,['hiking'],"Long but easy hike into the springs. Definitely worth the trip. The springs are beautiful and relaxing. Take bug spray!! Horse flies were the size of my fiancé and not as nice :)

The springs are varying in temperature. The bottom spring, the first “pool” you come to is like a nice hot tub temperature. The further up the path you go the hotter they get. Too hot to stay in. 

All in all worth the trip!"
133,2018-08-04,['snowshoeing'],Fun but packed in the summer. The trick is to go in the fall or early winter. Snow scares the crowds away.
134,2018-07-30,[''],Fun
135,2018-07-29,[''],Heaven.
136,2018-07-29,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful and easy to do. Be ready to deal with horse flies-they hurt when they bite! Besides that, this trail was beautiful. There were quite a few people here. Get there before 9:30 for good parking. Keep in mind that the sign for the parking lot is only visible when you come from one direction. We passed it and had to ask for directions to get there.  There is a lot of shade on the trail which was really nice."
137,2018-07-25,['hiking'],"5 miles round trip! We got to the parking lot on a Monday at 8AM and had plenty of spaces to choose from. This was a fairly easy hike. I had 3, 11 year olds with me and we all managed just fine. The waterfall is very low this time if the year so the hot springs were considerbly more hot than we expected. The trail is fairly wide and well maintained. When we got down the parking lot was full and people were parking randomly. I got an unwanted full  view of some lady's boobs who was standing bare chested rummaging through something beside her car which was by mine. I had 3 preteen boys with me so I asked her to please cover up. She didn't seem so happy I said something but not everyone wants their kids to be seeing some naked woman. Other than that and the horrid bathrooms at the parking lot the hike was very enjoyable! We did see a few snakes so try to stick to the trail."
138,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"Took the entire family of six (two year-old rode in a backpack, but four year-old walked on his own). Don't be misled by the report of small elevation gains—the cumulative effect of all of the up and down builds up after a while, especially with small kids. Also, hearing that the springs at the top were too hot to even touch, much less climb into, we ended up splashing around in a small pool about a quarter of a mile from the top of the trail. All said, it was a SCORCHINGLY hot day and at only 6,000 feet in elevation, you don't get much relief from the temperatures of Utah in late July. Also, while the trail is shaded in sections, there is still a lot in direct sun. Would be fun to try it again when it's cooler out!"
139,2018-07-22,['hiking'],Loved doing this hike when there was still snow. It made the hot springs that much more fun and rewarding.
140,2018-07-21,[''],"We arrived at the hot springs by 8 am Friday morning and only two other cars in parking lot. Very few people came and went before 10 am. It was getting crowded after 10 so we left. We enjoyed this fairly easy hike and loved the hot springs. The most enjoyable hot springs I've ever been to. Don't pass this hike up. Follow advice to arrive early, be respectful of others enjoying the pools, please take out your own trash, watch out for rattlesnakes and other wildlife, most importantly take your time and enjoy this wonderful place."
141,2018-07-20,[''],Beautiful hike in and fun hot springs. Avoid on the weekends as it’s super packed
142,2018-07-19,['hiking'],"Don't let the elevation gain fool you. Although it is only a 636 ft gain, you at least double it with the constant up and down.  Great hike as well as beautiful drive to the trail head. We must have been between groups because we passed many on their way out and were the only ones at the spring for about 10 min. before several others arrived. Temperature of the water out of the falls portion was 115-120 per another hiker that brought a thermometer. Too hot to stay in it for mid day, but would be perfect for early morning or late evening."
143,2018-07-17,['hiking'],"This would definitely be a 5 star, but the hike and hot springs are overly popular now. Beautiful at sunset and fun at night with lanterns and some good music."
144,2018-07-16,['hiking'],"my husband and I arrived around 8:45 am this morning to hike this trial. it must’ve been a good day to go, because there really weren’t many people on the way up or down! the hike up was really nice since it was still early, the temperatures were perfect! we didn’t stop much, so we arrived at the hot springs a little over an hour. the hot pools were smelly, but beautiful, the water was super blue! my only complaint was that one of the only people up there at the same time as us was a middle aged man, all alone, ass naked wallowing in the pool with the double waterfall. I expected to see some naked teenagers, but seeing this guy was actually pretty creepy, we didn’t appreciate that he kept standing up and exposing himself either. it was much hotter on the way down but it took only 45 minutes or so, it’s a really good hike for all skills levels with a great reward!"
145,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"We went mid July on a Sunday at 7 am. And very much worth it. The parking is insanely limited, so arrive early. 

The hike was great! Not too difficult or easy. 

The Hot Springs do have a smell, but that’s expected. We did come across a ton of trash, including half a watermelon, that we packed out of there. Otherwise, I’ll absolutely be back!!"
146,2018-07-13,[''],The water was really stinky like rotten eggs. It kinda made the hike not enjoyable. I might have gone at the wrong time of the year. I’ll have to come back in spring
147,2018-07-08,['hiking'],"The hike is beautiful! Very easy for anyone, in that there is only a slight elevation gain, and it’s heavily shaded for most of the trail. Lots of red rock, trees, and people kept talking of snakes, though we didn’t see any, unfortunately. The reward at the end are the hot springs. Which, smell really bad. Some parts are boiling hot and should be avoided, while most of the areas is perfect temperature and a great place to relax. If you’re lucky enough to get the first pool, before reaching the small waterfall and remainder of the hot springs, take it. It’s the deepest, largest, and most private of all. And surprisingly, there weren’t many people for a Saturday. Highly recommend the hike!"
148,2018-07-07,[''],"Great time killer, bring a picnic"
149,2018-07-04,['hiking'],Great hike! Ages 60-9 years old. Tons of photo ops.
150,2018-07-03,['hiking'],"This was a great trail for my 6, 7 and 11 YO. My mom even came at age 70. She’s not very fit so it was a little hard for her but with some stops to catch breath she made it all the way up. My husband and girls went ahead and made it up quickly. I stayed behind to be with my mom.   I ran into 1 rattle snake and a normal snake. We started the trail at 3pm and it was in the 90’s the trail was very warm but shaded with a nice breeze. We used up all our water!  The views of the red rocks and trees are amazing and the hot springs are very warm. Almost too hot in areas. I’d like to come back in the winter.  The way down was super nice it was about 5:30 we stopped at a cooler area to swim and the temp was perfect. It was about a half mile from the other hot springs. Kids went all the way under and my 11 YO couldn’t touch in some areas so it was deep!  They loved it!  The way back was easier and we made it  by 7. I would say if you walked there and back without any stops you could make it in 1.5-2 hours but if you have little kids that like to look at everything or needs breaks it will take a long a lot longer. Definitely a must go to hike!! We loved it!!"
151,2018-07-01,['hiking'],It’s a great hike. Parking lot is outrageous. A few rattle snakes were spotted. The hot spring were amazing.
152,2018-07-01,['hiking'],This is such a beautiful trail. We got there around 6:45am and the parking lot was already 3/4 full. The trail is very easy to hike with breath taking view around every corner. Gorgeous canyon.  By the time we got back to the parking lot close to 10am it was completely packed. Cars parked everywhere blocking in other cars. I suggest arriving early to find a spot!
153,2018-06-30,['hiking'],"This trail is perfect! Nice and shady on the way up, and such a fun reward to swim in the hot pots when we got there. The kids also wanted to try a little swimming hole on the way down and liked it even better than the ones at the top, as it didn’t smell of sulfur, the water was deeper, and the temperature was a bit cooler."
154,2018-06-23,[''],"Loved this hike. I took my 5 kids, ages 5-15, only my oldest complained about the sulfur smell. The trail followed right along the river. It was beautiful all the way up, even the drive. The hot springs themselves were nice, however, I forgot our water shoes, which I highly recommend.  Also, I did read about others talking about nudes, but assumed, no way would there be any when we went. I was wrong and so disappointed when my poor kids had to be exposed to a young, naked couple. Its illegal, but they obviously didn't care and wanted people to see them.  Do what you want, but when kids are around, they should cover up with bathing suits.  Also, we got to the trailhead about 7:30 in the morning, there were only 2 parking spots left. there were maybe 10 people at the hot springs but by the time we left, there were so many. We got down to the car around noon and there were so many cars, I had about an inch on both sides of my car to get out of the parking lot because people were parked on both sides of the entrance.  another reason to go early.  I would definately recommend this hike and go again, but for best experience,  go earlier than I even did!"
155,2018-06-23,['hiking'],Easy and beautiful hike. Took about 2 hours round trip
156,2018-06-21,[''],"Great hike, watch out for juvenile rattlesnakes on the trails. Saw 4 on June 19th."
157,2018-06-20,['hiking'],"We arrived to the hot springs at around 6:40 am and had it all to ourselves until about 7:30 am, it was amazing! We definitely lucked out because as we were hiking out around 8:45 there were a few people at the falls and we passed by several coming down. Got crowded pretty fast. I would recommend going early, I couldn't imagine getting in those hot pots when it was hotter in the day. Also one thing, be prepared for the sulfur smell, I was surprised, it's strong but once you get to the springs, it settles down, But overall, I LOVED the hike, and can't wait to do it again."
158,2018-06-18,[''],Loved this hike... clean trail and worth it to get to the Hot Springs.
159,2018-06-17,[''],"One of my favorite hikes with a great reward at the end! Hike is so pretty as it runs right next to the creek most of the time. As you hike up there’s definitely up hill parts, but it also levels out all throughout the trail which is nice. The hot springs themselves are absolutely incredible! Some pools are super hot, some are warm, and some are cool. Very relaxing."
160,2018-06-16,['hiking'],"When we went in September, there were so many Dragon flies along the river, which was beautiful with the blue green water the closer we were to the springs - looked enchanting and reminded us of fairies.  
The trail was fairly easy. We took our kids ranging from 9 to 17 and they all enjoyed the hike.  It is as a pretty hike in the fall with the changing leaves, but after the hike the hot springs were still to hot that time of season.  We needed to cool off so we swam in a swimming hole below the springs to cool off."
161,2018-06-12,[''],"Nice trail, well worn.  Pretty views.  Gets very crowded.  Best to go early to mid-morning..  Saw 10 snakes (not rattle) on the trail and around hot springs, just FYI."
162,2018-06-10,['hiking'],Nice moderate hike.  We took kids ages 3-12 and they all loved the pools. Total time was about 4 hours. Trail got narrow at a few points but overall it was well maintained.
163,2018-06-09,[''],It’s really amazing. Been there with my friend last year.
164,2018-06-06,['hiking'],"Easy, wide trail along the river with relaxing hot springs overlooking a waterfall."
165,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"My husband and I completed this hike on June 3.  

We camped nearby the night before and woke up at 5 to get an early start.  The trail is very easy to follow and is mostly flat with undulating small hills.  We never had to stop to catch our breath.  

Hot springs were amazing and beautiful.  We found one that seemed to be about 90 degrees - perfect for us.  Since we went so early, we had it to ourselves for a while, but by the time we were leaving, others had shown up.  Only complaint is that we had to clean out beer cans before we soaked.  Not cool!

Obviously the main draw of this trail is the hot springs, but the rest of the trail was beautiful as well."
166,2018-05-31,['hiking'],"Very BEAUTIFUL trail. No signage at trailhead, but just head straight, not across bridge. I’d rate this more on the easy side, but very worth it."
167,2018-05-30,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful trail and lovely hot springs. The reason I am not giving a five star rating is because of the two naked men in the hot springs, one of whom got out and walked around FULLY NAKED in front of my teenage daughters. Please remember that nudity is illegal here. Keep your pants on, for crying out loud."
168,2018-05-29,['hiking'],"So fun! Very beautiful hike, but very slippery after the rain."
169,2018-05-28,[''],The trail is really green and beautiful right now! The hot springs were a little crowded but when is it not?:)
170,2018-05-27,[''],"Easy hike. Busy, go early for parking spaces. Such a beautiful scenery!"
171,2018-05-24,['hiking'],Loved the view of the waterfalls! It was beautiful. The hike was moderate. It took longer than I expected but it was worth it!
172,2018-05-21,['hiking'],"Nice hike, fairly easy. Go early to beat the crowds and to score parking in the lot. We left the springs by 11am as it was getting very busy already, but enjoyed some nice less-busy time earlier in the morning. DON’T park on the street if the lot is full, we passed a cop on the way out ticketing every car on the street. They likely check this area frequently since the lot is small."
173,2018-05-20,['hiking'],"This is a great hike with beautiful scenery! The hot spings at the end make it that much better. Going on a weekday is also better, like everyone else said. Also keep in mind there are no changing areas at the springs, and if you are hiking back in the evening it can get a little chilly. The fall colors in september/ october are really gorgeous."
174,2018-05-19,[''],"This trail is beautiful and peaceful in spite of it being busy at times. The parking issue needs some fixing, but the trail itself is well worth it."
175,2018-05-18,[''],a lot of people go real early is best
176,2018-05-18,[''],This hike was so much fun! My 4 year old loved it! Just a reminder if you bring things with you take it back. I saw a little bit of trash in the springs and that was not cool y’all we can do better
177,2018-05-17,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes to do. Easy, and the hot springs make the hike well worth it. Sometimes it can be pretty crowded so be aware there may be limited availability for room in the springs. Beautiful scenery along the way. Enjoy!"
178,2018-05-17,[''],beautiful
179,2018-05-10,[''],Fun hike.
180,2018-05-09,[''],This is a great hike if you’re looking for something casual with something nice to enjoy at the end. Definitely recommend going on a weekday to avoid the traffic. Watch out for snakes on the side of the trail! All in all a great trip that took us about 7 hours including the drive to/from SLC.
181,2018-05-07,[''],Crazy amount of people on a Sunday afternoon. Good workout.
182,2018-05-07,['hiking'],"BE WARNED
We went up to celebrate our anniversary- there's not enough parking in the lot, so we just joined all the other cars off the side of the road. We enjoyed the springs- a little busy but not awful. We got back to our car, only to have been given a parking ticket along with 30-40 other cars all in a line for ""illegally"" parking. We apologized to the officer (who was only a few meters in front of us, giving more cars a ticket..). He said its a ""huge issue"" for them and told us to get off the road. And in my head I'm thinking ""then make more parking..... cause this solves nothing!"". They come often - especially now that its getting busier and just go all the way down the roads, giving ticket after ticket! I don't know any way around it because the lot only fits like 15-20 cars!! Good luck if you want to try it. We enjoyed the hike and springs, but the parking situation is a joke."
183,2018-05-07,['walking'],The trail was great and the water was amazing! Just lots of people on a Sunday for sure!
184,2018-05-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful and scenic hike. Great for the dogs. Not TOO crowded for a weekday I suppose, at the springs themselves."
185,2018-04-26,[''],"Beautiful hike. Plan to take sandals and/or swimsuit and a snack to stay and dip your toes in the springs and hang out for awhile. Very neat, unique place!"
186,2018-04-24,[''],really good hike and great views while you hike.
187,2018-04-24,[''],Go early or weekdays to avoid crowds. Clean up after your selves! Be prepared to see naked people ☺️
188,2018-04-24,['hiking'],Really enjoyable hike and great hot springs.
189,2018-04-23,[''],I found someone’s wedding ring on the trail today. If you lost your ring please contact me by email at jbump86@gmail.com. Hopefully whoever lost it sees this.
190,2018-04-22,['hiking'],This was a amazing experience! The hike was easy and beautiful in some places. Me and my family went on a Saturday and it wasn’t as busy as I thought it was going to be. Parking was the only issue because of the amount of people! I would definitely do this again! We got in the hot springs and everything was very laid back and fun!
191,2018-04-18,[''],"I love this hike, such a beautiful view and totally worth the moderate hike!"
192,2018-04-18,[''],Were spikes needed at all?
193,2018-04-18,[''],"@jared, roughly 2.5 miles each way, 5 total."
194,2018-04-18,['hiking'],Is it 5 mile one way or out and back?
195,2018-04-17,['hiking'],"Loved this trail!  I went on a Monday and it was not heavily trafficked at all.  There were people there but I had a couple pools to myself at most times.  The springs were incredible and such a treat.  The hike itself was not difficult.  I would recommend to not wear jewelry in the hot springs, I didn't realize this but the sulfur in the springs oxidized my silver ring.  I don't hate it, just unexpected.  A little added souvenir if you will.  Highly recommend!  There was some trash which was unfortunate but it was incredible overall."
196,2018-04-15,['hiking'],"Such a fun trail! We got there around 10 this morning, thinking it was early enough to beat the crowds, we were wrong. Parking was crazy. But the hike to the springs was beautiful and easy. We took our two boys 7 & 2. When we got to the springs a nice lady told us where a good spot to sit with kids was! I was surprised by how hot some spots were. But it was amazing! Seriously, such a fun experience. We took a garbage bag and picked up some garbage we saw coming out, but honestly it wasn’t to bad! Also someone before us had said a kid had cut them selves on some glass but we never saw any. Getting out of the parking lot when we got back was kind of a joke. People will just park anywhere even if it boxes someone in. My advice would be to park on the road."
197,2018-04-14,[''],"Hiked up there will my toddler in a backpack and, a 6 & 9 year old.  Very pretty. My kids did great and LOVED the hot springs."
198,2018-04-11,[''],"Went up this morning, broken glass on the trail and in the lowest spring. Removed as much as I could. Would highly advise wearing flip flops or something."
199,2018-04-11,['hiking'],Beautiful and not super difficult trail with a treat at the end of it. We hiked it about a month ago and were amazed by the variety of colors.
200,2018-04-10,[''],"Did again yesterday, TRASH EVERYWHERE by the lower falls, towels, clothes, glass alcohol bottles, beer cans, etc. So annoying that people can’t pick up after themselves."
201,2018-04-09,[''],Always a pleasure.
202,2018-04-07,['hiking'],Great hike on a good trail. The color of the water near the hot springs is amazing.  Love hiking mornings ad avoiding and avoiding the usual crowd. It was overcast and the eating rain which also keep the crowds down on a Saturday.
203,2018-04-02,['mountain biking'],"way overused, no place to park. In the past it was a favorite...now its a mess. to many people."
204,2018-03-31,['hiking'],This is a classic for me and my fam! I’ve gone several different times but my favorite has been going in the winter and getting up there around sunset to stay and watch the stars come out while you’re surrounded by fog. Beautiful hike!
205,2018-03-25,['hiking'],We hiked today 3/24 and started around 1pm. The trail was not crowded but the springs were PACKED. Wouldn’t recommend going on the weekend unless you’re happy with bunches of people and not many places to sit and enjoy the water. We did see lots of happy puppers however! 
206,2018-03-25,[''],We did this hike today. Absolutely beautiful!!! There was lots of sweet dogs and friendly people. The hot springs felt amazing! Even my 6 y/o son enjoyed it. The trail was a little muddy in some spots but most of it was dry. I cannot wait to do this again.
207,2018-03-22,['hiking'],"We hiked it today 3-21-18, gate was open, and only 10 people were up there... we got to the top around noon and ate lunch then came back down, the snow is melting in some places so it's a little muddy at some parts... but the majority of the trail was either dry or damp... the water was really warm and nice :)"
208,2018-03-19,[''],"We hiked yesterday, 3-18-18. The gate was open, so we were able to park right at the trailhead. The pools are awesome!"
209,2018-03-12,['hiking'],Hello - does anyone know when the winter gate is scheduled to be open so that we can drive all the way to the trailhead?  Trying to take a group of kids and the extra hike on the road is just too much for them...
210,2018-03-12,[''],"Sucked walking on the clear dry road so long before you get to the trailhead because of the winter gate. If I come when the gate is closed next time Ill bring bikes. Very crowded and heavily trafficked. I went early morning before much people headed up. If you go when cold than bring something good for walking on ice, its very slick. The springs were pretty cool. I would have preferred to go to it in lower light conditions as the water seems neater colors. Ill definitely go again."
211,2018-03-09,['hiking'],"Beautiful! Worth the hike, we were quite sore with the added 3.8 mile walk on the cement back to the trailhead, and the 2.2 miles back to the springs. Overall it took us about 2 hours and 20 minutes to get to the springs, and 1 hour and 45 minutes to get back to the car from the springs. Watch out for slippery rocks and nude bathers ;)"
212,2018-03-03,['hiking'],Went yesterday to find we had the entire trail to ourselves from start to finish. Winter gate is closed which added about 3.8 miles each way. I felt like the trail wasn’t marked well to begin. Once you pass the bathrooms you continue straight on the trail until you come to the hot springs (about 2.5-3 miles) up the trail. I brought micro spikes but didn’t need to use them. It wasn’t bad going up the trail but pretty icy and slippery on the way down. Didn’t see a lot of trash.
213,2018-03-03,[''],Love this hike. I hike it winter and spring. Long haul when they close the road up to the trailhead but worth every step.
214,2018-02-20,['hiking'],"Love the hot pots. Great trail. Just FYI, the road was blocked off 4 miles from the trailhead so it ended up being about 12 miles total. So do allow for extra time. Also, go prepared for the trail is super icy, I would recommend some kind of microspikes. All in all, worth it :)"
215,2018-02-20,[''],"Slushy morning snow freezes over in the late after.  Some wheels for the road would speed things up.  Trail is nice but a girl broke her ankle today, so think about traction."
216,2018-02-17,['hiking'],Super icy so make sure to bring spikes or some kind of extra traction. The road is closed about 3 miles before the trailhead making this 11 miles round trip. The springs are kind of gross right now because people aren't packing out their trash and there's a lot of build up of moss.
217,2018-02-15,['hiking'],"Went on the hike February 8th. It was a long hike from the closed gate to the hot springs. The road was clear today, would have been great to ride a bike to the trail head then hike in. The trail itself is completely iced over. There are a couple of patches where you walk on dirt but the rest has at least an inch or two of ice. I would suggest some sort of ice traction for your shoes. Great hike and it is beautiful. Hot springs are really warm."
218,2018-02-10,[''],Really cool place. Word to the wise... we went in Feb and the winter gate was closed so we had a pretty long (2+mile?) hike to the trailhead. I wish I had brought a bike for that part! Thanks to tips on here (thanks guys)
219,2018-01-26,['hiking'],Hit this up this morning. Took 4.75 hours round trip from the gate including soaking for 30 minutes.
220,2018-01-25,['hiking'],"Pretty heavy traffic but a beautiful hike!! If you go in the winter, go prepared. The trail is super icy and we wouldn't have made it without yaktrax spikes. Totally worth to relax in the spring at the end."
221,2018-01-14,[''],"We did it!! And it was even worth slipping and pulling a groin muscle. It took us 6 hours total from the closed gate to the hot springs and back. We spent about a half hour in the ‘hot tub’ and we had it all to ourselves. Nice because we had to strip naked to change back into our dry clothes. That’s because we headed up at 6 am. We saw about a hundred people on our way back. Now I’m going to go buy me some spikes/crampons. Someone on the trail said to us, pointing at his spikes, “best 15 I ever spent.” Thanks brah. "
222,2018-01-14,['hiking'],
223,2018-01-11,[''],Fun Hike. Pretty scenery l
224,2018-01-07,['hiking'],Ok so there is a little bit of parking at the gate but the main road to the trailhead is 3.4 miles so in total it was about 12 miles. I brought spikes which were super helpful. I would recommend you bring snacks and extra gloves. It was raining today so we were soaked and cold! It took us 5.5 hours not including sitting In the hot springs. So pretty though! I would do it again
225,2018-01-06,[''],anyone know whether there’s parking where the road is closed off?
226,2018-01-03,['hiking'],It was truly a magical experience. I’m a Cali girl and don’t see snow much. This was a winter wonderland for me. Being able to soak after a 6 mile hike in was so worth it.  The scenery was beautiful. What an amazing experience. My boyfriend had this all planned out. It was perfect. He packed in wine and a delicious cheeseboard. We met a couple of cool people. Next time we know to bring in hot coco/coffee and water shoes but I was beyond happy with my cheeseboard and wine.  Check out some photos we uploaded.
227,2018-01-01,['hiking'],"Hike was great, we started at the winter entrance as the gate was closed for the season. We started around 9:30am and it was still pretty icy, I would recommend microspikes. The total hike was 12 miles round trip and took 6 hours round trip including an hour in the water. Highly recommend bringing snacks, saw some people brought cheese platters and wine, I should have done the same. Worst part was my girlfriend forgot the ramen noodles in the car (2 miles of arguing) after I packed the stove all the way in. At least, we had hot chocolate. It would have been nice to have shoes for in the water as well."
228,2018-01-01,[''],It was a good hike and the hot springs felt amazing
229,2018-01-01,['hiking'],The gate that is closed in the winter is located at 40.07667 -111.41613 and is a 3.6 miles away from the actual trailhead. According to google it takes about 1hr-16min to walk to the trailhead. I doubt this takes into account the ice and snow you may have to slide around on to get there. I'll have to record my times next time I hike it. As of my writing this it was pretty snowy.
230,2017-12-21,['hiking'],"Gate is closed. Lots of ice towards the very top but a great hike. Just a reminder, it's about 4-5 hours from the gate, if you want to be able to spend 30min-1.5 hours up at the springs. A lot of people were trying to hike in around 3 without realizing how far it was because Google maps pulls up only the trailhead and half the trail. ..don't be dumb and get stuck in the dark in a snowstorm."
231,2017-12-20,[''],The gate is CLOSED despite complete and utter lack of snow :( today is 12/20
232,2017-12-13,[''],"As of 12/12, the road is open all the way to the trailhead. Use caution over the considerable ice and light snow on the last mile or so of the road. A couple treacherous ice sheets in the last 100 yards to the pools but trail is well packed and springs are hot as ever. Cool kids don't go on weekends."
233,2017-12-07,['hiking'],"Great Hike!
Anyone know if the gate is closed for snow after the storms last week?"
234,2017-12-03,[''],Awesome and family friendly!
235,2017-11-27,['hiking'],"As many people have said this is a busy trail with limited parking! But, the hot pots are an amazing place that is worth the hike (trust me I have hiked there every month except December and January)!"
236,2017-11-26,['hiking'],"Gradual up and down trek, easily manageable for families with kids.  
November is pretty muddy, so you may experience some sliding and slippery shoe soles.
About 1/2 way up the scent of sulfur appears, and the hot springs themselves, have a strong sulfur smell.  The temperature is warm to very hot, and one spot can change quickly to very hot.
Recommend packing water shoes with straps, a dry set of clothes, beach towel, and an extra pair of warm wool socks.
Even Sunday was pretty busy, if you’re looking for solitude you probably won’t get it here on the weekend."
237,2017-11-26,['hiking'],"It was a very nice hike, fairly easy except for the rocky trail.  Watch your step to avoid twisting an ankle.  Early morning was great; but by 10am there were a lot of people on the trail."
238,2017-11-26,['hiking'],"Fun, fairly flat trail. Still pretty busy for November. Trail is pretty muddy!"
239,2017-11-16,[''],"An amazing little hike, the trail goes up and down. Amazing water not very hot though but still absolutely worth it! Went on a Wednesday wasn’t crowded in the morning but when we started hiking back the parking lot was full and lots of people were headed up."
240,2017-11-04,['hiking'],"Uphill most of the way there and limited parking, very crowded but it was still worth it."
241,2017-11-03,[''],"Gradual, beautiful trail. Busy trail with limited parking."
242,2017-10-30,['hiking'],"I love it, just went this past weekend and the cool air made the steamy that much more awesome. Relatively flat. We got there at 8:15am on a Saturday and the parking lot was already almost full. Plenty of kids during the day so don't have your heart set on peace and quiet. lol. But it was awesome non the less."
243,2017-10-29,['hiking'],Surreal hike with great reward at the end!
244,2017-10-29,[''],Easy hike to the hot springs. A few cows along the way. Great scenery and the hot springs are awesome!
245,2017-10-29,[''],"Awesome fun hike. A bit crowded at the hit springs but not as bad as I thought it would be. Gorgeous area. The water has varying degrees of heat depending on where you sit. Some areas are freakin hot! But you can manage easily. We hiked it with our five kids (10,9,6,5,5) super easily."
246,2017-10-22,[''],Great hike! Really pretty. Along the river the whole way until you get to the hot springs. Go on a cold day for a better feel. We went in the morning at 8:30 and there were plenty of pools open. Not a lot of people on the trail and the trail was really easy. Flat most of the way with a few hills. Beautiful too. Definitely going again. It’d be a great camping spot too.
247,2017-10-22,['hiking'],It's a good hike but there is always a TON of people on it. It's hard to want to go knowing you are going to be surrounded by a huge group and generally the springs are overflowing with people. a lot of people do drugs on this trail and there is also a chance you will see people sitting in the springs naked there even though it is not allowed. At night people get wasted there and over all the trail has been ruined not by a lack of sights and beauty but by people.
248,2017-10-22,[''],So beautiful! Take your swim gear because the hot pools are fantastic!
249,2017-10-15,['hiking'],"This one is not a one and done! It will be done again someday, for sure.
When I read the trail name, ""Fifth Water Hot Springs,"" I honestly did not think I'd see much of a springs or even feel a hot springs. Every other places I have been with the name ""hot springs"" in it (such as Hot Springs, Arkansas or Hot Springs, Wyoming either did not have a hot spring or did not have one I could access. Additionally, any springs we did find were cold water, not hot.)
Ok, enough about that. On to this hike. Alltrails.com said this is a moderately hard, heavily trafficked trail. I'd agree this is heavily trafficked, but not that it's moderately hard. It's long. I'll give it that. It's about 5 miles, in and out, so it's longer than the Living Room trail in Salt Lake City, which was 2.2 miles, but Fifth Water is also relatively flatter with less elevation gain (666 was the overall elevation gain as compared to 967 for Living Room). This trail is also easier to walk on as it is relatively flatter, with more packed down dirt, rather than loose stone and boulders. There are big rocks on this trail, but by big I mean you can walk around them!!
Keep in mind as this trail has a lot of people, especially on weekends (when we went), finding parking is not always easy the later in the day you go (we got there about 2:30 and some people were parked .5 mile or more away from the trailhead). Lots of people do carry their backpacks with swimsuits, towels and food to take a dip in and soak in the hot springs at the end of the trail for awhile. So, as we went into the trail, we'd see lots of people pass us (I am a slow walker), but hardly any come back out! When entering the trail, it may be hard to find this trail as it's not marked (and others are). At the trail head, after passing the toilets, you will see one trail straight ahead that follows the left side of the river. Take this one. If you cross the bridge, those trails are different and may not go to the same place. Follow the trail to the left of the river for about 3/4 of a mile to a bridge. Cross this over the river for the remainder of the trail.
I really enjoyed this trail. It was fun, pretty and just the right amount of ups and downs. Hope to go back again someday later!
PS. Keep in mind at least for us, neither of us had cell signal.... a good way to stop using tech for sometime! :)"
250,2017-10-14,[''],"Trail was beautiful today and was a great place to enjoy the changing leaves. We made it there around noon and it was starting to get crowded. I made it to the parking lot by 10 and grabbed one of the few spots left. By the time we left at 3 the parking lot was way overfull, parking only along the road."
251,2017-10-11,[''],"Amazing area. Went while all the trees were changing color. Reds and yellows everywhere! Quite a few groups hiking here too but the hot springs are so big, there was no problem finding a spot. Will come back again!"
252,2017-10-09,[''],"Super pretty and a really easy hike in! We got there at about 9:15 Saturday morning and it was already pretty packed, but still plenty of room to explore and enjoy the springs! Would highly recommend in fall, the colors are so beautiful!"
253,2017-10-08,['hiking'],beautiful fall colors! great and easy trail
254,2017-10-08,[''],awesome!
255,2017-10-07,['hiking'],"We went with our kids 2 and 4 years old. We took packs just in case and ended up using them at least part of the time. The pools were amazing! Our kids loved it. We took a tent to change clothes in and it was good because it snowed part of the time so our kids had a dry place to change. It's long, but totally worth it! It's moderately easy--even slowing down for 2 sick/elderly people, we did it. It was too much for my mom in law, but the rest of us (3 teens included) were just fine."
256,2017-10-05,['hiking'],Good trail for sightseeing and fall photography.
257,2017-09-29,['hiking'],"Okay.  This is as good as it gets!  Gorgeous fall foliage, perfect temps, fairly easy hike, and incredibly stunning hot springs.  Lucky us, we had the place almost to ourselves, arriving and leaving in between waves of other hikers (Started hike at 2:15pm Thursday and left the Hot Springs at 5:30pm).  There is something special about the milky blue water next to the bright reds and yellows and greens of the leaves.  This was our 27th hike since June 1st, and though 5 miles is a little long for my kids with special needs, they did great!  We couldn't have done this one 3 months ago, but we're stronger now.  Yes!"
258,2017-09-27,[''],Beautiful trail! Fun hike! And gorgeous hot springs!
259,2017-09-25,[''],"good trail, well used. the hot springs are really cool. well worth the hike."
260,2017-09-22,['hiking'],I loved this little hike. Easy. Went on a Friday morning at 8am and only saw 5 people. I think the rain forecast helped. As beautiful as it appears in photos. I'd definitely do this one again.
261,2017-09-18,['hiking'],Great hike! It's usually crowded so plan for a weekday or night if you want less people around. Kid and do friendly. Being a garbage bag and gather garbage as there's always lots left behind 
262,2017-09-17,['hiking'],"Great Hike, not to busy... the hot spring are nice. However avoid days with to many children.. it seems that parents jut let them run wild.  There were several kids trowing mud in the pools and  splashing all over.  It's a great hike, lots of beauty and a great prize at the end. Parents please take care of your children. This is not a playground or your house... 
Dogs are welcome and seemed to do well on the trail."

264,2017-09-08,['hiking'],"Amazing. I've lived in this area my whole life, heard a million wonderful things about this place, yet never went. Now I kick myself. Relatively short, not ""very"" difficult hike. But breathtaking little views and wonderful small swimming holes all along the trail to the hot springs themselves. Highly recommended."
265,2017-08-29,[''],"very easy and beautiful hike... just beware of creepy, old,  fat naked guy

what possess this guy to see a single chick out here half his age and think,  oh,  it's socially acceptable to take my pants off and stare with binoculars is beyond me.... But yep. there he was."
266,2017-08-27,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! Take a dip when reaching the waterfall/springs, well worth it! Don't forget your water and enjoy the views."
267,2017-08-26,['hiking'],"Very beautiful trail and the hot springs were an absolute delight. Just be warned- some parts of the trail are a bit narrow and the smell of sulfur at the springs is pretty strong at first (you get used to it after a few minutes). But overall, excellent little adventure for hikers of all experience levels."
268,2017-08-23,[''],"Attempted to head up in the spring of this year, but the road was closed part of the way and there was snow. Decided to head up later when the weather warmed up to hike the long distance to the pools. Went on a Monday evening around 6 PM. There were only about five other people there. As we hiked down around 9 PM there were many people hiking in. Be aware of: snakes, water spiders, a long hike in, and smell the entire time. The falls are beautiful, the pools are warm, and it's a fun spot to visit.

269,2017-08-22,['hiking'],This was an amazing hike.
270,2017-08-18,[''],"Went on Thurs morning and it was getting crowded by noon even on an off day.  The hike up, Springs and everything about it was good."
271,2017-08-13,[''],it was beautiful
272,2017-08-11,['hiking'],I love this trail!
273,2017-08-10,[''],This was a great hike. My 13 yr old grandson and I had a great time. We left at 7:30am on a Thursday and had the whole place to ourselves. A blast!  On the way down around 10:00 am we saw a few hikers on their way up - including a 50+ year old man hiking buck naked. Not a sight I wanted my grandson to see. We can't unsee it now.  I used to live in Oregon and that happens all the time there but it was very disappointing it happened here. Oh well. Didn't change the opinion of the hike. I recommend it.
274,2017-08-09,['hiking'],We went on a Tuesday evening hoping it wouldn't be as crowded as weekends. Wrong!  Very crowded at the springs and the trail was busy too. The trail is maintained and not too difficult. The springs were the perfect temperature but again you were sharing every pool with a lot of people.  Met some cool people but also dealt with a lot of drunks with zero respect for nature.  We saw probably a dozen beer cans and other trash scattered around the main springs.
275,2017-08-06,[''],"Great place to visit. Nice trail to the hot spring. We left the parking lot around 8:15am and was already packed. As we headed back toward the parking lot we passed huge groups of people. Make sure you go early! Also, many dogs were headed to the springs and this isn't really a good place for a dog. People ended up tying them to a tree near the hot springs which just caused them to be anxious."
276,2017-08-05,['hiking'],Great hike and falls and hot springs were amazing.  We started the hike about 7:30am on Saturday. Only ran into a few people until the hike back.  Met some great friendly people. Enjoyable time.
277,2017-08-05,['hiking'],"This was a great hike, I loved seeing the amazing scenery. we left about six pm and made it back down to our car by 9.  while we were there i think there were only about 15 people, we had a blast. the waterfall is beautiful. as we were leaving we passed alot of people coming up at night also. It appears the early hours or late hours are the time to go."
278,2017-08-04,[''],"nice hike with gorgeous hot springs and waterfall.  go very early in the morning to avoid the crowds.  we got to the hot springs at 7 am on a Thursday morning and we're the only ones there.  Left at 8:30 and passed more than 50 people hiking in, so it can get very crowded."
279,2017-08-04,['hiking'],"Beautiful diverse scenes alternating between red rocks and brown trails through sparse woods filled with shrubbery. In early August I saw lots of birds and some potguts scurrying around. There were some beautiful green banks with flowers right around the head of the hot water springs. The hottest pools were at the base of the waterfall but some a little further down were still pleasantly warm. The sulfur smell only comes towards the last hundred yards or so and is bearable until you get used to it. 
There were also a few places along the trail where the brook had little calm clear pools that were great for cooling off in."
280,2017-08-03,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! This is my favorite hike by far. It's not super hard as I carried my 1 year old up it. He is now two and I'm planning another trip! There's different hotspring pools, some are very hot and some are cool, and a beautiful waterfall. I highly recommend going!"
281,2017-07-28,[''],"Perfect little hike to do in the late summer, fall, and early winter. Not a hike you want to do in the spring due to snow melt (the pots get cold) But in the fall they are perfect. The trail is easy, with just a few steep areas. Gets pretty crowded though, even in the middle of the night."
282,2017-07-26,['hiking'],"I took a small dog and 6 kids with me today - ranging in age from 9 to 17. They all did great on the hike and enjoyed playing in the waterfall. Since we hiked in the middle of the day, the hot pots weren't enticing. We were surprised how HOT some of the water is, so definitely test each area before walking in. Wear swimsuits under your clothes so you can swim after the hike and bring either water shoes or flip flops to put on while walking on the rocks around the water. There are a few areas along the hike where the dirt has washed away recently due to heavy rain, which has made the trail very thin with a steep drop-off. The kids and dog handled it OK, but someone with less balance would really struggle."
283,2017-07-23,['hiking'],"A great little hike. We did it at night on the way up, hug out in the upper pools for like 7 hours, and then came down the next morning. Fun times."
284,2017-07-18,['camping'],Beautiful place. Cleaned up a ton of trash from previous campers. Yuk! It's called pack it in pack it out. Not pack it in and leave it!! Also lots of people everywhere. Other than that it really is a wonderful place to be. Most people had a hard time finding the springs and stopped us for directions as the trail isn't marked. I'd like to point out that following the river and crossing the second foot bridge will take you directly to the springs.
285,2017-07-16,[''],"Took a girl hiking up here last night, let's call her ""Bess Jagshaw"". Wow V fun! Ended up kissing and talking about aliens and you know ""living life""........would give her 5 out of 5 stars. Gr8 kisser and decent catch phrase player. Idk just thought you guys would be interested in my love life. oh yeah the hike and springs were cool"
286,2017-07-11,[''],"So beautiful and a blast with a group of friends or family. We always bring a change of cloths so we don't have to hike down wet. I love going at around 3am and watching the stars, not long after the beautiful sun rise that lights up the springs is absolutely breathtaking."
287,2017-07-10,['hiking'],
288,2017-07-08,['hiking'],"This was my first hike ever, and I made a lot of amateur mistakes that I learned from. I went in the winter which was actually really beautiful, but much more difficult. The road to the trailhead gets snowed in and closed, which just about doubles the distance. The hot springs at the end were beautiful and felt amazing after all the hard work of trudging up through the snow."
289,2017-07-05,['hiking'],"This is more of an easy nature walk. The trail is enchanting. We were lucky with finding a spot because around 11PM about 40 people came up and had a hard time finding room in the springs. Sadly, I packed out a lot of garbage from other people littering. Please pack it out! Overall it was a fun night!"
290,2017-07-05,['hiking'],"This is a great family friendly hike.  We took a hike crew with kids and dogs. It was perfect and very fun at the springs. The waterfall was fun to explore and cool off. 

Definitely will do this again."
291,2017-07-03,[''],Very pretty. With thermal waters.
292,2017-07-01,['hiking'],Very nice trail. Good view of the stars. The hot springs are beautiful.
293,2017-06-28,['hiking'],Beautiful hike.  Some moderate inclines on dirt and rocky trails.  My advice is to get there early so you can have this place to yourself for a bit.  People were streaming in around 11 am.
294,2017-06-26,['hiking'],One our favorite family hikes!
295,2017-06-20,[''],"Saw one big snake and 2 little ones. The hike itself was really easy and pretty. The springs smell pretty bad but you get used to it. Take off your jewelry, the sulfur tarnished all my silver stuff. Went on a Monday night and it was busy. Loved it though!"
296,2017-06-19,['hiking'],Love it
297,2017-06-18,[''],Saw a few snakes. Good moderate level hike. Not overcrowded at all.
298,2017-06-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful but busy. Be aware that the Diamond Fork road has no sign, and the trail isn't marked. Follow the directions others have given here, and you'll be fine."
299,2017-06-15,['hiking'],So many butterflies. Beautiful butterflies....
300,2017-06-04,['hiking'],Always an amazing time at the hot springs! Lots of rattle snakes this trip! Be careful all! 6/3/17
301,2017-06-03,['hiking'],Do it at night with a full moon. Spiritual experience.
302,2017-05-31,['camping'],"We loved this trail. Took a kid carrier along for my toddler with enough gear to camp overnight. We were lucky to find a spot in the parking lot by the trailhead at 9am on Memorial Day weekend. (Saturday). The trail was a bit congested and we saw a few dogs on the trail (leashed/unleashed). My 8yr old loved this trip; catching lizards, checking out snakes, collecting terrestrial bugs, the spectacular views...amazing! Hot pots were either extremely hot or frigid cold. Hiking, camping, and hammocking was great past the second fall where it was less trafficked and more secluded and shaded. My only complaint was carrying a floppy, dead weight toddler over the eroded trails where there weren't any posts/fencing (ain't gonna lie; got a little scary). Bring sunscreen, water, good shoes (some chic wore fashionable 2-in heeled boots), and more water!!"
303,2017-05-31,[''],way too many people that park in the road!!
304,2017-05-30,[''],"Pretty trail, almost like you're in southern utah with the red rocks. Very crowded. Be mindful, we saw 2 Rattlesnakes within 2 miles, with some insane guy catching one and letting his young daughter pet it...."
305,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"The trail is easy to find and follow. The scenery was very pretty with lots of pine trees. The river was running high with spring run-off and follows the trail the entire way. The sound of rushing water is a great addition to the hike. We started hiking at about 9:30am and there was shade through 35-40% of the trail which made for a nice easy go of it. 

I didn't track it perfectly, but my phone said we did 4.5 miles by the time we made it back to the car. It was further than we anticipated but not hard. I think most people would find the trail very manageable. We did the hike as a family and my 8 and 11 year old boys didn't find it difficult at all. 

The waterfall was the best part of the destination. I think most go for the hot springs...and they are OK. My 8 year old sat in the spring nearest the waterfall on the lower side of the fall and enjoyed it. But there were too many people. We were amazed at the number of people hiking up when we were on our way back down. It is a heavily traveled trail. 

All in all it is a nice hike. If you are looking for solitude (like we normally are) go somewhere else."
306,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"Having never been in this part of spanish fork canyon, I was impressed at the drive into diamond fork. Very pretty red rock walls line the main road. The parking lot for the hike was full leaving us doubling back to the next nearest parking lot a mile or so back the way we came. We had in our group 5 adults varying in athletic stamina, and 8 children aging 6 to 1 years old. With dragging our kids this was the hardest 5 miles total they might experience for some time. Having said this they and the adults had a blast when we reached the pools and waterfall we played in all of it...and all of it was a blast!before we finished the hike they begged us to come back. It is a very popular spot, with lots of people for good reason. If you want to come and enjoy this alone you might have to come when everyone is taken out by the zombie apocolipse, or really late in the evening, or just not the weekends. The hike effort is moderate. Bring food, water, and sunscreen(hats). It was an awesome adventure!"
307,2017-05-28,['hiking'],"A beautiful hike that follows a river up to gorgeous springs.   Admittedly, if you go on a Saturday like I did,  go early to avoid the crowds because this is one of those hikes people come from further away to do."
308,2017-05-28,['hiking'],Great hike for the whole family!
309,2017-05-27,['hiking'],I have done this hike in the summer and winter. Easy in the summer and quite longer in the winter as the road to the trail head is closed a few miles back. The trail was groomed or packed with foot traffic. If you're up for it I suggest going in the winter as the combination of snow and warm colorful hot springs is fantastic.
310,2017-05-27,[''],"Such a pretty hike!! We went mid morning so there were quite a few hikers on the trail, but still plenty of room in the pools. I look forward to returning for a night hike!"
311,2017-05-22,['hiking'],"Amazing hike! Went at night, sat in the hot springs and admired the nightsky full of starts! Really enjoyed it, you get over the smell and it can get crowded but it's worth it"
312,2017-05-21,['hiking'],Easy trail with a fantastic finish at the hot springs.  Great to do on a nice day when looking for a relaxing hike.
313,2017-05-21,[''],A very pretty canyon to hike in. It does get busy so get an early start if you can.
314,2017-05-17,[''],"Amazing but crowded, a little disappointed to see trash everywhere. Please pack in and pack out. Common courtesy people. Also, a lot of dogs. Some responsible dog owners took the time to clean up after. But some DID NOT?! Overall hike is amazing."
315,2017-05-15,['hiking'],Awesome scenery and beautiful runoff. The river is cold but the hot springs are perfect.
316,2017-05-13,[''],BEAUTIFUL!!!!
317,2017-05-10,['backpacking'],I have done this trail a few times. I don't recommend going in the middle of the day in the middle of summer. It is hot and by the end the last thing you want to do is sit in hot crowded water. The hike itself is lovely and there are several camping spots on the way up and more past the waterfall. We went backpacking and were able to go down to the springs at night when it was cooler and it was excellent! There was a ton of people but it was still a great experience.
318,2017-04-25,[''],Extremely crowded. People parking in the middle of the road . Hiked this in years past nice fun walk but on a Saturday morning I will never do again. Like walking through a state fair. Not worth the trip.
319,2017-04-24,['hiking'],Good and moderate hike. Even kids can get through this hike. We went there 3 weeks back and it rained the previous day. So it was muddy in some parts of the trail. Hot springs are always occupied so may have to wait to go in. Parking can get full pretty fast. May have to park on the shoulders of the road. Better go early.
320,2017-04-24,[''],"We went on this hike today with our 6,4 and 2 year old. It was a great hike, easy for kids who are active and like to be outdoors. The smell of the hot springs isn't pleasant and there's a couple steep ledge areas that are scary with kids otherwise I would have given 5 stars BUT it was way fun overall. We will definitely go back when we're a little more prepared."
321,2017-04-22,['hiking'],This is a very fun and beautiful trail. I admit that I try to go when less people. Have backpacked and hiked in a variety of weather. Be aware that a gate is in place of road to get in during winter months. I'm told there is more than one way into this hike though I've only gone one.
322,2017-04-21,['hiking'],Fairly easy out and back spring-fall. I'll be back! I even saw a moose!
323,2017-04-10,[''],Nice but too crowded and trashy. Would consider going again but not high on my list.
324,2017-04-07,[''],loved it! took 5 kids ages 5-11 no real issues other than a few breaks for the kids!
325,2017-04-06,['hiking'],"We parked at the Fifth Water Trailhead on Diamond Fork Road.  The hike was about 2.5 miles and took just over 1 hour to get there.  There were about 6 different hot pots to choose from; half were below the waterfall and were half above.  The hike was beautiful and there were many great backpacking camps both below and above the springs.  The weather was great and the trail was dry and free from snow even with all of the rain and snow we have had in the mountains.  There were lots of people at the pools wading and sun bathing, but the rest of the trail didn't feel crowded."
326,2017-04-05,['hiking'],"Great hike. Hot springs were pretty full but the ones behind the waterfall were less crowded, probably due to having to cross he stream. Water was very cold and fast moving."
327,2017-04-01,[''],Great hike.  It's an easy enough trail for flip flops. We decided to do it last minute after we attended the Holi Festival. The springs are amazing and felt so good!!
328,2017-03-30,['hiking'],"5th stream hot pots hike today. Perfect day to hike, sunny, no clouds, minimal breeze, 50s. Trail muddy in places from the previous rain.  Lots of water over the falls and down the stream"
329,2017-03-27,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. Upper springs is much warmer than lower and worth it - a little less traffic. You have to cross the river to get to the upper springs so be prepared! It's running quick right now.
330,2017-03-22,[''],"A little ice and snow still. Lots of people. Go up to the second ones they're a little more hot and less people. Pretty hike, pretty easy :)"
331,2017-03-20,['hiking'],"Make sure to go early or parking will be tough, and the springs get crowded really fast. A little bit of snow and ice still here and there, but pretty easy to get around it. There were a few nude bathers. Really easy trail, not much climb. A little rocky."
332,2017-03-17,[''],Gates were open today but super busy and a lot of the trail was still covered in snow so it was slippery
333,2017-03-14,['hiking'],"Love the hot pots. Great trail. Just FYI, as of March 7th, the road was still blocked off 4 miles from the trailhead so it ended up being about 12 miles total. Allow for extra time (I didn't XD), but it's doable in under 4 hours if you're in a hurry and don't stop."
334,2017-02-20,[''],I love it already
335,2017-02-14,['hiking'],It's beautiful out there
336,2017-01-15,['hiking'],"We went yesterday and started our hike around 2pm which got us to the hot springs by 5pm. The snow is pretty well packed on the entire trail so no snowshoes required. We wore snow boots but saw some people hiking in running shoes. We had to hike back in the dark but it was absolutely worth it because by the time we got to the hot springs at 5pm, most people had cleared out and we had a pool all to ourselves. The hike back in the dark wasn't bad because it was a full moon and the stars were beautiful. We forgot a headlamp and would definitely recommend bringing a lamp or flashlight if you're going to do the hike in the dark. Flip flops are also a good idea if you want to walk from pool to pool."
337,2017-01-15,['hiking'],"These hot springs are extremely popular, pretty much anytime you go. Normally this trail is only about 3 miles round trip but in the winter when the gate is closed the total is about 12 miles. We thought the cold, snow, and extra miles would thin out the crowds but we were mistaken. We went on January 14, 2017 and the gate was closed and the trail packed down in snow so you don't need snow shoes or even boots if you don't want. The hike took us about 4 hours plus about an hour soak in the hot springs and if you're ok cozying up with your new best hot spring friends you can enjoy the very warm pools or if you are a little more shy there are plenty of warm but not as warm pools to soak in as well. The sulfur is strong so you may want to take some precentarive measures so it doesn't end up taking over you life, I.e. Plastic bag for your swimsuit, limit the amount of clothes that come in contact with the pool, wash separately, etc. All in all this is a must do hike for anyone Utahn because let's face it, we only have a small amount of hot springs to enjoy. #fifthwaterhotsprings #hotsprings #daimondfork #spanishforkcanyon #hiking #beautahful #utahisrad"
338,2016-12-28,[''],"I just can say , It Was a Great Hike!"
339,2016-12-20,['hiking'],"A friend and I made the hike on 19 Dec 2016. The gate was closed on Diamond Fork Road FR029 a little west of Red Ledges canyon. We parked at the gate at about 4pm. We hiked for about 3.5 miles along the road from the gate to the trailhead. Then from the trailhead it was the traditional 2.5 miles to the hot springs. 

From the trailhead we hiked along the trail, passing the first bridge at the beginning and crossing the second bridge at a little less than the 2 mile mark. The bridge passed over Fifth Water. After a little more than 0.5 miles from the bridge, the springs and waterfall were on the right. It took us almost exactly 2hrs to hike the 6 miles in. We arrived after sunset, but the temperature wasn't bad. The trail was completely snowed, however it was firmly packed. I did it in Vans and some wool socks. Soaked for a few hours and hiked out at midnight. It took us 2hrs for the 6 miles back out. 

And that was the trip. The springs were perfect."
340,2016-12-14,[''],"I hiked this five days ago and the gate was closed. It took me about an hour and a half to get to the trailhead from the gate. About 6hrs round trip including the time we spent in the pools. I'd consider my pace faster than the average hiker. 

Anyway, it's beautiful! Especially with the snow! And we only ran into two other couples in the time we were there.  Well worth the time and effort."
341,2016-11-13,[''],We went on a Saturday night (tonight). One of the busiest trails I've ever been on (trying not to exaggerate). We watched a police officer give 6 tickets to cars parked illegally so don't park next to a no parking sign. Easy hike. Too many kids.
342,2016-11-12,['hiking'],"We enjoyed this hike for the most part - the pools are really pretty, and I can't believe the water was so incredibly blue!! 

The smell of sulfur was really horrible for about a third of the hike.  I guess this varies, so it may or may not be bad when you go.  It gave us both headaches, and we considered turning around.  It wasn't as bad by the falls.  

I was an idiot and threw our clothes in the washing machine with a full load, and we've washed them five times, using different advice we've found online and still can't seem to get the sulfur smell out of them.  So I'd suggest taking clothes you don't care about and not washing them with ones you do!"
343,2016-11-10,['hiking'],"The ending was quite rewarding with a dip in the hot spring. Wear good footwear as I didn't the last time I hiked to this place. There are also narrow paths that mountain bikers zoom through. I thought I'd get hit. So, keep watch."
344,2016-10-27,[''],Loved it. Not too hot. Go during weekday and go al natural like my man.
345,2016-10-26,[''],I love this trail. Very shaded for summer and beautiful in the fall with all the colors and leaves falling. I did this trail last January as well and the road was closed to the trailhead. So be careful if going after they shut the road down for winter. It adds 8 miles to the 5 mile trail.
346,2016-10-23,[''],I've wanted to do this hike for years!  It was very busy and we had to park down the road a quarter of a mile.  Those who parked illegally had tickets on their windows. Don't risk it.  We went on a Saturday at 4:30 PM and finished just as it got dark. We weren't fortunate enough to see any naked people.  Ha ha!!  The kids had fun holding a snake that we found on the trail.  I highly recommend the hot pots near the waterfall.  It was the perfect temperature this time of year.
347,2016-10-14,['hiking'],"Easy hike, drive out from slc before the sun comes up to drive into an awesome sunrise and hike in with no people. Did Friday morning and had the whole place to yourself, except for some campers that were camped along the trail. A lot of great places to camp and pre-made fire rings. Good for kids and families."
348,2016-10-11,['hiking'],"Very nice hike, the reward is worth it. It's a nice easy flat hike. Takes about 2 hours, a good hike for a first date."
349,2016-10-07,['hiking'],"Busy, busy, busy.  Fun to do on a weeknight at night.  Less people.  DON'T GO ON A SATURDAY! :)"
350,2016-10-01,[''],Great hike at this time of year. The fall colors were spectacular. There were a lot of people at the hot spring pools but still enough room to test out the water. Not bad of a hike for kids too but not for strollers.
351,2016-09-29,['hiking'],"We made the mistake of going on this hike during Memorial Day weekend. The parking lot and roads were crowded, as well as the hiking trail. Once we arrived, our group of 10 people decided not to go into the hot springs because it was just too crowded. The people there also don't have any regards for nature and the water felt slimy from all the trash. There were people smoking and drinking who just threw their buds and bottles into the hot springs. Always stupid people who have to ruin it for the rest of us. 

BUT...the top of the trail was still a great place to hangout and picnic with friends. We sat on one of the big rocks at the top, which had a nice view overlooking the hot springs. The dogs enjoyed splashing around and it was still enjoyable dipping our feet in once the weather got cooler."
352,2016-09-28,[''],"This was a great hike last weekend. The colors were amazing. As far as the hike goes, very moderate with very small inclines. The hike took a little over an hour at a comfortable pace. There was a lot of people at the springs bathing but hell its a free country. Everyone was polite and enjoying the area in their own way. The springs are pretty warm in spots so be careful with the kids so they do not get burned by the water. My group has kids from 8-11 and they all did fine. 
Side note...some reviewers complain about the kids because they can't let their dicks hang out at the pools. My advice to these people is don't be entitled. As soon as you purchase the land feel free to exclude children so you can base nude. Until then be a reasonable human and if you feel the need to bath in the nude on public lands camp in the area and hike up later in the evening when kids will not be there. I imagine that in the evening it would be pretty awesome with a wide open view of the night sky as well."
353,2016-09-26,[''],If you've been to this spring in the past DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GOING NOW. I've been here several times and never saw any kids as this used to be an adult spot with nude bathers. I went yesterday and was disappointed to find kids swarming everywhere and an overflowing parking lot at the trailhead. I made sure to get there early and was fortunate to have a fairly secluded spot to myself but I counted at least 40 people and more kids on my way out. This used to be one of my favorite spots but I won't be back again.
354,2016-09-23,[''],"On a 40 degree and rainy day this was absolutely perfect. Only a few other people there l, it was so peaceful. I'm used to much longer hikes but in rainy weather this one is a perfect choice."
355,2016-09-19,[''],Love this hike!
356,2016-09-10,['hiking'],"Forgot to mention - When we went in early July the smell was pretty bad, including a bit on the way up.  When I went two weeks later, on July 21, it barely smelled at all.  Not sure why.  The falls weren't as strong.  Wonder if that's why."
357,2016-08-26,['hiking'],"After reading other people's reviews, I definitely suggest going before the gate to the trailhead opens. We went when there was still a lot of snow, so the hike took us all day. We got to the hot springs a little before sunset and there were only about 4 other people. There was someone there who had gone up many other times (it was our first) and she said the hot springs were the brightest she had ever seen them. They seemed to get brighter as the sun set. Not sure what the correlation is there. There was also a naked man in one of the pools. That was a little uncomfortable, but we loved the hike and the pools felt amazing."
358,2016-08-22,['hiking'],"We loved this trail! The springs are so calming on your muscles after hiking up. There were several steep spots but we were able to make it up in a little less than an hour. Our dog loved the hike and lounging around while we soaked. We saw a couple horse back riders and bikers using the trail- so keep an eye on the pups if you take them. There are several pools so even on a busy day you can likely get a pool to yourself. We chose one with a nice little waterfall that doubled as a massage chair. We did see one rattle snake so be careful not to veer off the path without checking your surroundings! Also, perhaps this is common knowledge, but I didn't realize that sulphur tarnishes silver. Be sure to take off your jewelry before you go in!"
359,2016-08-03,[''],Absolutely love this trail! The natural hot springs are unlike any others I've been to. Easy hike for my 6 year old son.
360,2016-07-26,['hiking'],Completed in early July on a hot day. Warning! Parking can be the major difficult and frustrating part of the experience. We parked a god 1/4 mile and hiked along the road to the parking area. The trailhead is to the left. It is an easy to moderate hike. It is shaded. It follows water. Dogs were allowed. It does smell like sulfur as you get closer but the water runs sparkling clean. It is hard to get away from the crowds on the weekends. Beautiful scenery the whole hike and though crowded the people are great but people that hike are. If you are up for a little rock scrambling there a few pools and another small waterfall tucked a little further upstream.
361,2016-07-25,[''],Great hike! We took our two kids and they did great. Make sure to take swim suits so you can enjoy the best part and cool off for the walk back.
362,2016-07-12,[''],Amazing
363,2016-07-11,['hiking'],"Great, moderately quick hike. I take 11 year old scouts each year and they have a great experience. Yes, it does smell a little bit, but nothing bad. Gradual incline, so nothing strenuous. Beautiful hike the whole way and love how it follows the creek."
364,2016-06-25,[''],Really easy. Great for kids and dogs. Lots of shade. Steep at parts. Water along the trail.
365,2016-06-23,['hiking'],This trail head is very confusing to find. The sign small and hard to see coming from one direction. Just like the other girl said you get to point where you feel like you have definitely gone too far and you have yet to reach it! The road will become narrow and winding. Compost Bathroom at entrance. Long walk. I m an avid and quite athletic hiker and heard reviews with kid friendly but let me tell you its a haul for a little one unless you plan to carry them. We did not see any wildlife of concern (bears or snakes) The waterfall is beautiful. The hot springs hmmmm where to begin have never been to one until now. Truth be told it really stinks!! Sulphur hot springs smell terribly like sulphur. You think you will get used to it but the hot soak and the rotten egg smell just is nauseating. Small springs be prepared to soak with some strangers. Bathing suit and towel and me really stunk afterwards perhaps bring one you don't care for. ! Careful some of the water is chilly while other places you step can literally be scalding hot so take care to check before kids go in ! Interesting experience and very picture pretty  . I preferred the river rapids and river walk .
366,2016-06-20,[''],"A little confusing getting here. I'm sure people mentioned this before put after you turn left into diamond fork, you have to go straight for awhile. It gets to a point where you start doubting if you're going the right way, but it's there! Haha look for three forks, it's a smaller sign but most likely you will see cars parked there. Also once you park and get on the trails it may be confusing on if you take a left or right when you pass the outhouse. If you cross the bridge you'll see a sign that doesn't mention fifth waters, obviously don't go that way. Just stay left. There really isnt a sign for what trail to take so you may be skeptical but trust me! Don't cross the bridge in the beginning.
Hike is pretty easy, not too much incline or such. If you going during the day though it does get hooot! hah. The trail is half shade/half straight sun. If you bring kids be careful, there are points where the trail gets a little thin and the drop is not pretty. This is a busy hike! But then again I went on Sunday. Maybe it won't be so bad on a weekday. I could barely get a picture of just the waterfall itself without anyone in it. Water was a little low~ There are little section for you to chill in the water, but if it gets busy it gets a little awkward.. unless you are very friendly! I love the different color. I'm sure you've read this warning, but there are snakes on this hike! The first time I went I didn't believe but this time.. I saw two. One on the trail, and the second one in the water while I was in it. So.. be careful!"
367,2016-06-19,['hiking'],I decided to follow Google maps way although I have an iPhone to get there. It took me the back way towards sheep Creek about an hour away from The original trail head. This way it was all downhill it was moderately hard considering I had my son with me it was about 1.8 miles there and 1.8 miles back. Overall the trip was awesome I give it five stars because at the end of it the Hot Springs are worth it.
368,2016-06-17,['hiking'],Great trail.... Beautiful cool refreshing waterfall to swim in... Trail is sandy and makes it difficult to hike for kids... Lots of sun exposure so bring sunscreen and lots of water if hiking in summer. 9 year old hiked it no problem 6 year old was carried most of the way
369,2016-06-14,['hiking'],Great hike! Loved it.
370,2016-06-13,['hiking'],"nice one, very busy trail. take extra shoes to walk in the water."
371,2016-06-12,[''],"Beautiful hike along an amazing creek.  There are quite a few people that hike it, but it is still worth it and the hot springs near the waterfalls are awesome to soak in."
372,2016-06-07,['hiking'],"Great, easy trail. Went in June during the week and there was a moderate amount of people there. Not too crowded though. Take the second foot bridge, you'll know you're getting close by the smell of sulfur."
373,2016-06-06,[''],My first hike when I moved here 6 months ago! Worth it especially cuz it was still snowing when I went
374,2016-06-06,[''],longer than expected but anyone could do it.
375,2016-06-05,['hiking'],Fun place to go! Busy on weekends. Would recommend going up during day in the middle of week.
376,2016-06-05,['hiking'],Very busy weekend.  Dozens of butterflies but unfortunately lots of trash.  Hauled out 9 small doggie bags loaded with other people's garbage and used TP.  Please pack it out and leave no trace
377,2016-06-02,[''],"it was hard to find. Google maps was wrong. Had to go the long way round but it was so beautiful, and totally worth it. First time in Spanish fork canyon, and it did not disappoint BEAUTIFUL! Will return next time a will be a bit more prepared "
378,2016-06-02,['off road driving'],"I am looking forward to going to Fifth Water Falls for my first time.  However, I would like to take my wife who is unable to hike.  Does anyone know if you can ride 4-wheelers up to the hot pots?  If not, how close can you get?  Do you use the same trail as the hikers or is there a separate trail?"
379,2016-05-19,['hiking'],"We started at the trail head so it was only about a 5 mile hike there and back. It's a beautiful hike! Reminded us of Zions. Fortunately, we went early one day in the middle of the week, so we had the springs to ourselves. Highly recommend!"
380,2016-05-19,[''],It was awesome! Everyone should go!!
381,2016-05-17,['hiking'],This is a college hangout in the summertime. Probably best to go during winter to avoid the crouds of people. We left the hotpots at 8PM and saw at least 80 college kids heading up the trail. You might be better off to hike from the parking lot to a hotel that has a nice hot tub.
382,2016-05-02,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery. Easy hike to an awesome relaxing spot.
383,2016-04-24,[''],"Good too much people for my taste, but a nice hike all together!"
384,2016-04-19,['hiking'],Completed this today and it was the bomb. Made the mistake of trying to get to the springs though the sheep road..... Don't go that way!! Go through Diamond Fork camp grounds. We had to make the hike down from the springs in the dark with yet clothes while it snowed and it was still worth it!! Rated it as demanding just because of the sketchy spots where you can potentially slide down the side of the mountain.
385,2016-04-05,[''],"Beautiful at night with a clear sky, so you can see the stars while sitting in the natural hot spring."
386,2015-12-29,['hiking'],Loved this! Fairly easy. It was snowing once we hit the hot springs. We went the first week of November. Beautiful hike. Scenery the entire way up. Would definitely do it again.
387,2015-11-20,[''],I hiked this last weekend and the trail was mostly clear of ice. I was with some no hikers and they made it with a couple of short rest breaks. The pools were nice and hot!
388,2015-10-25,[''],Is ok my wife liked
389,2015-10-05,['hiking'],Even in early October the first part of the trail was very sunny and warm. Once you get about 1/3 of the way up however you start to get some shade and pretty scenery. The pools were pretty crowded when I first arrived at them but then people thinned out for a little while. I climbed up above the little spillover but the trail starts to get more narrow and brushy after that point. The pools are a lot warmer than I thought they would be. I was expecting bathtub warm but the one I tried to put my feet into was hotter than a hot tub.
390,2015-09-27,['hiking'],"I hiked this today (9/26/15)with my husband and three kids (2, six year olds and a one year old in a pack.) While it's not really a steep hike, it was a little long for my kids. However the destination was a blast. We took and lunch and stayed and played in the pools for about 2.5 hours."
391,2015-09-06,['hiking'],"This is an easy-to-moderate hike of about 2.5mi each way. The entire trip, you are following the river or (once) crossing over via sturdy bridge. The trail is mostly shaded, but there are some sections that do get quite a bit of sun. 

The views of the mountains on either side and the many (and mini) rapids and waterfalls are fantastic. It's Labor Day Weekend, and some of the foliage is just starting to turn towards ""fall colors."" Amazing (bring a camera)!

The parking area, though pretty large, was packed when we arrived... and when we left, too! The trail was somewhat crowded, but most folks were friendly and let others through if they were on a faster pace.

The hot springs were in full use by a plethora of other hikers. Kids of all ages frolicked and enjoyed the afternoon. Though we'd planned to take a dip, the overwhelmingly pungent sulfur odor coming from the springs had completely turned me of to putting any body part in the water.

Bring water and a lunch / snack - this makes a great day hike... and there are restrooms at the trailhead!"
392,2015-08-25,['hiking'],"A friend and I hiked up this moderately difficult trail. I'd say it is still pretty easy for children, but make sure to go earlier in the day if you have children. The springs are super hot, but there are a few areas that are cooler. The waterfall is also very unique in that it has a small cave area you can fit a few people in. Weekends can get crowded. Worth the drive for sure though!"
393,2015-08-08,[''],Great hike for the family.  Had a great time but make sure you give yourself enough time to enjoy the springs and get back before dark or bring lights.
394,2015-08-04,['hiking'],"This is a great hike! We love to go in early Spring, as soon as the road is open. The waterfall next to the hot springs has the higher volume of runoff at this time, and the cooler air temperatures in the Spring make the hot springs a nice destination. 

This is a very popular hike, so be prepared to see dozens of hikers along on the trail on weekends. To avoid the crowds, we go early to mid-morning on a weekday. With that being said, the hot springs occasionally attract people who like to soak in the hot springs in the buff. We've only come across that once, and seems to happen less and less often now.Thank goodness.

All in all, a fine hike for most"
395,2015-08-02,['hiking'],Few too many people and dogs but super easy hike and was my first time to a real hot spring! Went towards the end of July and the water was hardly tolerable.
396,2015-07-25,['hiking'],"It was an easy hike with pretty sights to see along the way. The hot springs can be really crowded, so I think it would be best in the evenings or early in the morning."
397,2015-07-12,['hiking'],"It was a nice hike, but maybe a little much for my 8 year old.  We had fun, on the hike, and at the hot pots.  Maybe next time we'll try a different day of the week though.  Saturday was absolutely crowded.  A veritable conga-line up and back."
398,2015-07-03,['hiking'],Fun hike. Hot pots are fun too minus the dirty hippies!
399,2015-06-28,['camping'],"I researched this hike and notice how popular it is. I try to avoid the crowded trails and tourists, but still I wanted to see the springs. Some reviews talked about coming in from the Northeast side on Fifth Water Trail-head where Forest Rd 051 and 398 intersect. It’s more of an elevation gain coming back up, but is worth it. The Northeast side of the spring has taller waterfalls and is much greener.

If you are staying overnight, you have better choices on camp sights if you come from the Northeast. The camp sites are surprisingly well established and close to the creek. Plenty of dead-fall for fire wood and fire pits already built. Insect repellent is highly advised.

The springs themselves are a great feature of the trail and has different temperatures. The wife and I didn’t want to soak for too long because of the crowds. Not really a place to relax if you’re looking for some peace and quiet. Although, our camp site was upstream and away from the noise.

Oh ya, watch for snakes!"
400,2015-06-24,['hiking'],"Very nice hike up to the hot springs.  The trail is a very easy hike so kids old enough to handle five miles of walking would enjoy this hike.  Don't expect anything overly magnificent about the springs.  There are some small pools you could soak in, but nothing like a swimming hole.  The rock formations are really neat and I enjoyed hiking along the creek for some great scenery."
401,2015-06-15,['hiking'],"beautiful easy hiking trail.  measured and it is just a little over 5 miles out and back.  the springs have a very strong sulfur odor that smells like rotten eggs.  the area is infested with snakes this time of year.  we saw 6 different large (3-4 foot long) snakes in a matter of just a few minutes.  2 of the 6 snakes were swimming in the springs.  we didn't stay long because of the snakes, and decided not to soak in the spring for this same reason.  loved the view on the hike though."
402,2015-06-09,['hiking'],Hiked it today with my son. A real nice hike. Watch for rattlers. Saw 3 near the trail today.
403,2015-06-01,[''],I love this trail so much! So rewarding! Not recommended if you rarely go hiking.
404,2015-06-01,[''],Scenic hike with interesting rock formations along the flowing river. The hot springs are crowded of course but if you hike around and up the back you can possibly find your own little private pool like we did even on a busy Sunday!
405,2015-06-01,['hiking'],Awesome day!
406,2015-05-31,[''],It was crowded but we did it on a Saturday.
407,2015-05-27,['hiking'],"Loved this hike. It seems like a long hike, but in the end it's worth it once you get to the hot springs, so pretty!"
408,2015-05-27,['hiking'],I loved this trail. It was easy and a lot of fun.
409,2015-05-23,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite trails in the area.
410,2015-05-11,['hiking'],"Awesome hike!  It is an easy trail with a few climbs, but my 7 and 9 year old managed it without any problems.  The trail head is accessed from a paved road and provides a beautiful drive in and especially back out with some open vistas.  Perfect 1/2 day hike."
411,2015-05-02,['hiking'],"This is one of the most perfect hikes that you can find in Utah. The trail is not strenuous, and it is especially gorgeous in Autumn when the leaves are changing colors. To top it all off, you get to relax in some hot springs at about 2.5 miles in! The only downside is having to put up with the occasional weird naked family."
412,2015-05-01,['camping'],"Easily one of our favorite hikes in utah, and one of our favorite places in the States. We've hiked it several times. Most recently was on 4/20. Legendary night!
My favorite is going before sundown and watching the sunset at the end of the canyon from the hot pots. Then! If the moon is in a new phase, or out of sight, the stars are EXPLOSIVE!!! Match that with your significant other and it doesn't get much better.
There are PLENTY of awesome places to camp and sit in the hot pots. The earlier in the day you get there the easier it is to find good places to squat for the duration of your adventure.
The water is absolutely beautiful in temperature, ascetics, and mineral content. Seriously, this is the cheapest therapy you'll ever invest in."
413,2015-05-01,['hiking'],"This is, to date, our favorite trail in the area. We have hiked here multiple times and we love it more and more each time. The hot springs are gorgeous and perfect temperature for relaxing after the hike in. We even love sitting under the waterfalls and enjoying the mix of hot and cold waters. The pools are a beautiful hazy blue from the mineral deposits in the water. Which means the water is amazing on your skin as well. 
You should beware that there is often nude bathers on this trail, however most are respectful and deserve respect from others as well. Most will even cover up if there are children around."
414,2015-04-22,['hiking'],"I hiked this with my 7 month old and we wore our swim suits the whole way! It was a blast, but you need to know the tips and tricks to this hike to have a good time! For example, bringing water shoes so the rocks don't hurt your feet! Check out my blog post about it on Things2DoInUtah (I did a guest post there, my blog is called Wanderookie.com)"
415,2015-04-21,[''],"The trail was awesome!!! I went with my 4 year old and he did pretty good, we had to take a lot of breaks going uphill, make sure you take enough water. I would say we took 1.5 hours going up and 1 hour coming down.

The hot springs are beautiful!! We had an amazing experience."
416,2015-04-20,['hiking'],"Nice hike with several hot springs at the end. The trail is well maintained and easily identifiable from the trailhead. Be aware, this is a very popular hike, and parking is limited, so get there early or expect to part along the road."
417,2015-03-10,['hiking'],"Nice little hike, easy but lots of people. The pool/waterfall is pact and people don't always follow the ""leave NO footprint"" rules when it comes to the outdoors. Found lots of trash along the way, I packed up as much as I can. Other then that, it was a fun hike to take the family."
418,2015-03-08,['hiking'],"Well traveled, easy hike.  Plenty of people and dogs on the trail today.  Lots of mud, slush, and snow. Family friendly trail, although there's a bit of drinking and nudity up at the pods.
I recommend a mid-morning start on winter/early spring days - when the trail is in full sun."
419,2015-03-02,[''],Road is open all the way to the trailhead as of 3/1/15
420,2015-02-08,['camping'],Easy hike with the river along the whole way.  Several tiers of waterfalls and various temperatures of baths.  Two nice waterfalls right past the springs that have camping along them (so you don't have to smell the sulfur all night).
421,2015-01-12,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes out there! Easy walking and a fun time once you are up there. I go up there around every 6 weeks and the warmth of the hot springs fluctuates with the water table but you will always be able to find a hot pot! Remember to check the map and follow the signs. People go up there without really knowing where to go. One time I was hiking to sheep creek and ran into a couple about 5 miles in and they were looking for it. This made me nervous because it wasn't the first time I have helped someone.
422,2014-07-06,[''],"Nice hike, some narrow parts. Did it with four kids, some adults and a dog."
423,2014-06-02,['hiking'],"1st self initiated hike since moving to Utah.  absolutely beautiful hike w/ hot springs to boot. very good exercise , will be checking out more in the winter."
424,2013-09-30,['hiking'],"I really enjoyed this hike.  It took my time going up so I could take pictures and kick back here and there, so it was about an hour and a half in.  Coming back is faster of course and I didn't stop so it was only 45 minutes.  Either way, allow about 2 1/2 - 3 hours not counting the swim.

The entire hike is by rushing water and the first 2/3 is by the river.  Once you get to the bridge that crosses the river, the trail shifts to creekside and you'll notice you're getting near the hot pots when the water changes color and you'll notice it's room temperature not long after you cross the bridge.  

Once you get up to the hot springs there are plenty of places to park and the water is great - hot and relaxing.  I went on a Sunday afternoon, starting around 4:00 and there were people but it certainly wasn't crowded.  

All in all, great views, great hike, nice reward at the end of making the trek and I recommend it for anyone.  If you're out of shape, like most uphill hikes it may be a challenge but it's worth it."
425,2013-09-30,['hiking'],"Super awesome hike more like a walk then a hike. The hot springs were a blast. Very crowded so go early or later in the day. Doing  it again soon with our little kids. We only took the big kids today.  Beautiful ! 

"
426,2013-09-26,['hiking'],"this trail was so much fun! I was told it was only a two mile hike and it definetly is at least 5! the hike itself was pretty simple, hills are not that steep but it is long. we got stuck behind some cows on the trail and had to scare them away! the hot pots are nice and big and warm :) the waterfall is pretty! I recommend going at night! the view of the stars is absolutely breathtaking!! don't forget towels, you'll regret it:)"
427,2013-08-19,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes in Utah valley! It's moderately difficult as the trail can become narrow at times and a little steep. But there is good coverage from the sun provided by all the trees as you cross through the forest. The hike itself is enjoyable and pretty, and the hot springs/water falls are incredibly beautiful and fun. I've gone a couple times during the day and it's great albeit a bit crowded. I prefer to go at night and bring glow-sticks for the hot springs. I've only encountered skinny dippers once in the dozen times I've done this hike, but apparently they're not uncommon. "
428,2013-05-31,['camping'],"Law enforcement isn't there 24 hours a day!!! Some young boys got quite a sight!!! ;) I ranked it 3 stars for the encounter and cleanliness. Soaking naked is really that much better? (Please don't answer!!!) Anyway, it's a great hike and know that here are hot pots above the waterfall as well and there is a 2-tier fall above the first. If you climb behind the first, or lower, fall you can actually stick your head out of the falls and get a great picture. Also there is a small cave if you wade in and through the falls. Just be sure to duck! It is a busy trail....at least on weekends."
429,2013-05-26,['hiking'],"Perfect this time of year. It was a little crowded because it was Memorial Day weekend, but there was still plenty of room in the hot springs. Beautiful, relatively easy hike with a great reward at the end. This is a must do!"
430,2013-05-17,['hiking'],"Love this hike. It is a moderate hike, but my 7 year old was able to do it. I love hiking up next to the river. This year we hiked it in early spring, so it was still pretty bare. Beautiful nonetheless. And the hotpots at the end are very rewarding."
431,2013-04-29,['hiking'],"This is a most beautiful hike!  The trail follows the stream, and the ever-changing views are astounding.  Gigantic boulders rest in the water, creating diversions and small waterfalls all the way up.  Hotspots at the top are such a welcome reward.  We soaked for a while, had lunch, and, feeling refreshed and  invigorated, headed back down.  This hike is definitely one I will take again.  "
432,2013-04-25,['hiking'],"Amazing experience! Difficulty is MODERATE. Distance is 5(ish) miles total from the three forks parking spot. The trail was beautiful and clean. The hot springs were hot (imagine that) and accessible. And despite all the negative talk, there was no trash, underwear, or mess. It was clean fresh and fun :) hiked in April. I have a lot of pictures up."
433,2013-01-31,['hiking'],Be careful with this one. It's 5 miles overall from the trail head. But if the gate it closed (winter time) then add another 7-8 miles. We did this one last week and It's a beautiful hike in the snow. I'll try and add some pics from it 
434,2012-10-01,['hiking'],"This trail is completely wrong. It's 5 miles out and back and it took about an hour getting there. This is located up Diamond Fork Canyon and starts at the Three Forks Parking area. Why here are 5 hit spring tubs there. There was a nudist when my friends went so be careful if bringing children. There were a few guys cleaning out the hot springs because a couple were having ""fun"" the night before. It is a little dirty as people don't like to pick up their trash ( bottle caps, candles, underwear, socks, foil etc) Nice hike overall.  I would consider this moderate not easy as listed

Driving directions: take I-15 to the US-6 exit. Take the exit east towards the mountains all the way up Spanish Fork for about 11 miles. Turn left off the left hand side of the road that says ""Diamond Fork."" follow the trail until you see ""Three Forks Trail head."""
435,2012-09-30,['hiking'],"This trail is not near Fairview, it is near Mapleton and Spanish Fork as it is located up Spanish Fork canyon"
436,2012-07-13,['hiking'],"For me it was hard. Says easy, but it's hard if you are a bigger person. Feels way, way longer than 4 miles. Nice to soak at the top, and the waterfall is cold very nice. Take off jewelery or the sulfer tarnishes them. And near the springs watch out for snakes! We saw 3 and they're not small garter snakes, they are big snakes. Also if you have children with you, there are a few places where the rails have fallen down the hill. And it's narrow with slippery sand on the trail. Be careful"
437,2012-07-08,['hiking'],My wife and I and some friends did this hike in march which was really fun. Enough snow had melted that the trail was mostly clear and the weather was still cool enough that the hot pots were a nice welcome. 
438,2012-06-17,['hiking'],"Nice easy hike with some beautiful views. Hot pots were nice, and not super crowded (April). On the way out we got snowed on, but all-in-all a nice hike. Definitely send someone in ahead if hiking with small kids or youth."
439,2010-08-14,['hiking'],"Easy for all ages. Nice waterfall at the end but the real reason to hike to the falls is the hot springs. Many soaking pools with varying degrees of heat. Bring something to soak in, however be aware many people consider the hot springs ""clothing optional"", so if you have children with you, send someone ahead to scout the springs. Most people will don covering if you ask. "
