Super challenging hike. It’s about 3.7 miles of incline. 3400 vertical feet. Be prepared. Once you get to the sign your home free. All down hill from there. It’s about 9 miles round trip.  
Good luck...."
1,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade']","Good trail to lose weight or a good morning hike, but no real “reward”, unless, you take a branch off to Provo peak or Y peak. Doing so will also add significant time to your hike. 

No shade tag on, only because the Y trail section absolutely sucks. No new view and 100% exposed to the sun. Same goes for the Bonneville Shoreline trail.

So yes, recommended, but only really for training or weight loss. Saw no moose unfortunately ;)"
2,2019-08-31,"['hiking', 'closed']","We wanted to turn this into a 15 mile hike, so we started at the Y parking lot at 7am.  Hiked to the Y and back down, then hiked the shoreline trail to slate canyon, did the loop, down the Y trail, then the shoreline trail again to slate canyon and back.  My gps calculated it at exactly 15 miles.  Finished by 12:30pm.  We were in the shade for almost all of the hike.   It was pretty quiet, saw 4 other people on the slate canyon trail, and another 4 on the slide canyon trail.  We didn't see any animals, but the bee's were crazy in a section of Slate Canyon where we crossed some water.  Beautiful day for a hike!"
3,2019-08-30,['hiking'],"We hiked from the Y trail and around to Slate Canyon, everything was beautiful, I didn't care for the trail coming down Slate Canyon, pretty rocky. I did enjoy the hike "
4,2019-08-14,['hiking'],"Really really beautiful! We hiked it the first weekend in August. We summited Y mountain from Slate Canyon loop and went down the Y trail (we parked two cars so we didn’t have to do the full loop). If you’d like to do this option it is beautiful, but hard. It ended up being a little over 9 miles. Hiking up Slate is very green with a few pretty meadows once you make it up about 4 miles. The river has dried up now, and I’d highly recommend HIKING BOOTS. steep when you get up towards y summit, but rewarding! Hardly anyone was on the trail. We loved this hike. "
5,2019-06-10,[''],"Hiked 2nd week in June.  Basically all snow has melted.  Rivers are at their highest which means, bring chacos or water shoes.  You'll be crossing the river 6 or 7 times.  I imagine it will calm down quickly but if you are hiking near 2nd week of June just be aware.  Great hike. Very steep in places.  Non experienced hikers probably will not find it enjoyable.  Excellent views of Provo when you drop down the other side of the mountain.  Easily marked trail that you can navigate via Google maps or this app.  "
6,2019-06-03,[''],"not much shade
have to walk through small river"
7,2019-05-12,['hiking'],Hiked this yesterday.  At about 3.2 miles up slate canyon it turns into a single track trail.  At this point the trail becomes pretty muddy with a small stream of water running right down the trail due to melting snow.  I didn’t go any further as I didn’t want to deal with the mud.  This portion of the trail is probably 2-4 weeks away from being dry because of runoff.  This canyon is much more beautiful than Rock canyon and with a lot less people.  Definitely worth it.
8,2019-05-02,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']",It’s really hard. We went in early May and there was a ton of snow at which caused us to get lost. It’s steep the entire time until you get 3.6 miles in and then it’s all downhill. We only made it 3 miles up and turned back after taking a half mile detour because of snow.
9,2019-04-03,"['hiking', 'over grown']",
10,2019-01-21,[''],super steep and the views aren't much better than just sitting in the parking lot
11,2018-12-23,['trail running'],"It's great to go out with your dogs on. The trail can either be a full loop or a ""Y"" and back 45 min hike/jog."
12,2018-11-22,['hiking'],Fun Thanksgiving day hike! It took 5 of us about 3 hours. We ran into a blizzard at the top. Beautiful loop!
13,2018-09-25,[''],"Beautiful hike, good work out! We lost the trail for a bit coming down into slide canyon, but found it again after a bit of bushwhacking. The weather was perfect and the leaves were beautiful!"
14,2018-09-07,['hiking'],"Fun hike! The trail gets a little difficult to follow descending into slide canyon, so make sure you have the map downloaded. Coming down the face of y mountain can be tough on the knees and pretty hot. About 70 oz of water was perfect for me and it took about three hours. Watch out for moose!"
15,2018-09-02,['hiking'],"Great scenery with changing terrain from Forrest to meadows and beautiful views. Great for cardio. If you don‘t have much time, but need a great workout, this is the trail to hit. I have done it both ways. Only downer is the very busy “Y” trail section."
16,2018-07-20,[''],"Definitely difficult, the trail can be hard to see behind the mountain and the area right before reaching the Y is a bit difficult, steep sides, narrow trail..we came down the face of the y and it was way too hot. My dad ended up with heat stroke so I would definitely suggest starting there and ending in slate canyon. The view behind that mountain is INCREDIBLE."
17,2018-07-19,['hiking'],"It took my buddy and I almost six hours to complete the whole thing. It was 100% with it. Beautiful views. And, you get to see a great view of Provo. I recommend it."
18,2018-06-22,['hiking'],It was so beautiful! The trail is definitely a bit overgrown on the back side of the mountain. Great hike overall.
19,2018-06-13,['hiking'],Very steep hike with not amazing views. Going up from Slate Canyon it is very steep and rocky. I also was confused where to start (I started going towards Y mountain before turning around). The trail gets even more steep after the fork towards the very top of the hike. While hiking down the trail it is overgrown with vegetation so it is difficult to see the trail. Watch out for snakes and bring lots of water!! Above the Y trail was beautiful and the start of the canyon was also beautiful. Lots of vegetation on the back side of the canyon. Difficult hike with very little traffic.
20,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"Slate Canyon is a great hike. I go up the canyon about 3 miles everyday. It's quite the workout. The first 3 miles are almost entirely uphill. There is long steep hills, one after the other. I've lost 30lbs making this hike everyday."
21,2018-05-28,[''],Good times!!!
22,2018-04-21,[''],"Steadily steep coming up the Slate canyon access road, loose shale in some parts, and breaks partially into pines near and after the fork. Pretty views of the backside mountains."
23,2018-03-26,[''],"March 24th - hiked the loop today with my husband and 20 month old. It was a challenging hike but the views are worth it! We chose to park at Slate, walk the Bonneville Shoreline then up the Y then back down Slate. We were very happy to have snowshoes.
Also, we were grateful for this app and being able to see the map because part of the trail was covered with snow."
24,2018-03-24,[''],It's difficult but the views and experience are worth it. In the summer the sky is incredibly blue and in the winter it's so silent you can hear your heartbeat.
25,2018-02-02,[''],"Fairly steep climb, but fairly low traffic. 

Jan 28th - I hiked from the Slate Canyon side with microspikes all the way up to the saddle that spills over into Slide (~3.5 miles). At that point, I would have needed snowshoes (north facing slope) to continue, so I walked back down Slate."
26,2017-12-24,['hiking'],"Aside from the face of Y mountain and then the beginning of slate canyon this hike is very scenic. From the backside of maple mountain until the face of Y mountain is incredible green and in some places has foliage that grows over the trail at 7 feet tall. Very secluded and has little traffic. Definitely worth it, especially if you’ve already done the bigger hikes in the area."
27,2017-11-27,[''],Great trail for a quick afternoon outing! Beware in the summer lots of sun and some homeless people have set up camps at the base. Nothing to be worried about but it’s always a surprise to see a little shanty down there.
28,2017-07-17,['hiking'],Lightly used trail. I used this trail to summit Y Mountain and Lion Head. It also forks and takes you to the Provo Peak Trailhead. Not a lot of shade.
29,2017-06-23,['hiking'],"Starting from the trail head, this is a fairly wide yet steep trail. At roughly 2.5 mile the trail forks & I stayed left. I was unsure at first because it almost immediately turns into a narrow, single track trial that almost looks like a game trail instead of a hiking trail. From this point to about the top of the Y was the most beautiful section as far as fauna goes. The trail from the Y back to the trail head was not scenic or shaded at all, but there are great views of the valley beyond. The Bonneville Shoreline section was extremely dusty."
30,2017-06-23,[''],"Nice if you don't want to see many hikers. A pretty dusty trail, with views that are pretty good. If you are deciding between this and Rock Canyon, I'd say the views in Rock Canyon are better."
31,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Nice loop. Fairly quick ascend. I would categorize it more as moderate. Beautiful views from the top just before descending down to the ""Y""."
32,2017-05-15,['hiking'],"This trail is one of my favorites. Although parts of it aren't totally glamorous, if you go during the right time of the year its just gorgeous. In June the mint fields and flowers are in full bloom on the backside of the Maple Mountain.

Starting at the Slate Canyon trailhead you'll follow a decently steep trail and a fork to the left to arrive at a gorgeous meadow that is a nice spot for a break and lunch. There are some natural springs near the meadow that are tapped and the water coming out of them has tested more pure than my city water (do you own testing). The pipes seem to only run during spring runoff though, so I wouldn't totally depend on it.

Immediately after the meadow will begin the steepest part of the climb to the backside of Maple Mountain. Near the top of the climb, you will pass many wildflowers and mint fields. This will curve around Maple Mountain and slowly descend near Y mountain through some old growth trees. Descending there is gorgeous until you break out onto the face of Y mountain. The descent near the Y is the least fun part of the hike, but overall its worth it for the gorgeous vistas and the small amounts of traffic."
33,2017-05-02,['mountain biking'],"The Shoreline trail is a nice ride, but fairly flat with no shade. The canyon trail is way too steep to have an enjoyable ride. I bike a fair amount and this was just way too steep on the way up to enjoy. It's beautiful, but there are certainly better trails for biking."
34,2017-04-15,['mountain biking'],Not the best place for mountain biking. There is a trail where you can get a view of the whole town. But it's short.
35,2016-09-19,['hiking'],"I started on the left side and about a mile in there is a patch of rocks to the left right before the trail curves right. I took a seat to have a snack and in just the few minutes I was sitting there I saw two rattle snakes!! Be careful if you have children playing around up there because the snakes hid perfectly - one under a rock and the other under a pile of smaller rocks. The area looked like the perfect place to bring a picnic, but after seeing the two I definitely don't think so anymore! I very easily could see a kid playing around in that area and getting bitten. That side of the trail is quite steep and I didn't expect kids to be on it, but to my surprise, there was a kid around 4/5yo up there with his mom so ya never know. Aside from that, it was beautiful!!"
36,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Nice, relatively tough trail.  A few things to note as of 9/4,

- Saw an extremely large full-grown Bull Moose near the apex of the hike, on the back side.  We were within 30 feet of it and was watching us intently.  We instantly turned around and went back down our approach, unfortunately.
- Autumn colors are very prevalent.
- If you're heading East up Slate Canyon (vs north towards Side Canyon) about 3 miles in there will be an unmarked split path, go to the left to continue with the loop.  If you reach a campground and a rather steep pitch you're on the right track."
37,2016-08-29,['hiking'],I would also agree this one would deserve a hard steeper than you think it's going to be but definitely worth doing just to say you've done it once
38,2016-08-15,[''],"Not a great hike. One side is Y mountain--busy sandy switchbacks. The other is a steep-ish trail covered in dry, sandy dirt with varying amounts of slate rock on top. In between is a wooded stretch. Sounds nice, but the trail was almost overgrown with shoulder-high grasses and plants. And the grasses and plants are full of bugs. 

The views and scenery are spectacular, however. So if you're willing to pay the price to get in, out, and through, that is not a bad payoff. 

You'll be in the sun most of the hike unless you go in the early morning. 

If you go up the Y-side first, it's a longer total uphill but you get the drab and hot Bonneville trail and Y mountain section behind you early. If you come down the Y side, just keep in mind it is steep switchbacks and unprotected from the sun.

If you go up the Slate side first, it feels like a very long uphill on what can be relatively unstable footing. Saving the Slate side for last means, potentially, a lot of slipping and sliding on your way down. You may want poles to aid in stability if that's a concern."
39,2016-08-01,['hiking'],"should NOT be rated ""moderate""! definitely deserves ""hard"" rating. Slate canyon is straight up and rocky. No satisfaction in this hike."
40,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Went up the slate canyon side. Steep incline most the way up. Lots of shade but absolutely no water! Pack lots of water (3 L person). Not great for dogs (rocky, no water). Came down the Y. Would recommend starting early and going up the y so that you are hiking in shade in the hotter parts of the day."
41,2016-06-26,['hiking'],"Hiked the loop clockwise from the Slide Canyon (Y) Trailhead. The trails starts out with 9 switchbacks until it get to the top of the ""Y"" then heads south to Slide Canyon. It climbs steeply most of the trail. In the upper section the trail goes through lush forest with thick undergrowth. At the top of the loop the trail breaks out of the trees for views of nearby mountings. The decent down slate creek is very very steep in a few places. after a short distance the single track trail becomes an old road."
42,2016-06-17,[''],"There are some really steep parts, but it's gorgeous."
43,2016-05-23,['hiking'],slate Canyon is one of those well worth hikes beautiful scenery and the rocks are absolutely gorgeous
44,2015-06-08,[''],2  springs conveniently located along the trail
45,2015-05-29,['hiking'],"This is more of a compilation of different trails than it is a trail itself. I went out from y mountain. it's about a mile to the Y, and then a mile to where it breaks off to go up to the top of the mountain, and then about a mile until a meadow. It wasn't super well marked there. I had to look a little bit for the trail. the views aren't as spectacular as they are from, say, Squaw Peak, but overall a good hike. going down to slate Canyon the trail was a little bit overgrown. Overall I enjoyed the hike."
46,2015-04-12,['hiking'],"This was a great hike, with fantastic views that I think top those in nearby Rock Canyon. The trail is a bit more steep, so you have to work for it. There are several springs along the way that are mostly obscure, but there is one very clearly available about 3 miles out (see picture in my tracks). We couldn't complete the loop due to snow on the very northwestern portion of the trail, so save the full loop for May or later, unless you are already familiar with this trail. Oh, and definitely bring the dog along for this one!"
47,2014-05-18,['hiking'],"Great hike.  I've done it a couple times starting at the mouth of Slate Canyon. the first couple miles though are tough. It's just an old steep gravel road, so it's not the most exciting. but one you get up higher, it turns into a dirt trail with some killer views and great scenery. There are two springs along the trail with fresh water if you camp up there that are very convenient but easy to miss."
48,2013-08-18,['hiking'],"The full loop starts either at the mouth of Slate canyon or at the foot of the Y trail.  I like the latter route.  From the Y parking lot, hike the boring switchbacks to the Y itself.  Near the upper RH tip of the Y is a well-marked trail that heads a bit south then east along Slide canyon.  After leaving the canyon you enter some meadows and lightly forested areas, where you'll encounter a trail split - LH heads to the top of Y mountain, RH continues to climb then eventually drops down to Slate canyon.  Hike the old Jeep road with lots of loose gravel down to the mouth of the canyon, then north to the flat Bonneville Shoreline trail for the last ~two miles, which takes you back to the Y parking lot.  Well-marked trail all the way."
