1,2019-08-17,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'over grown', 'rocky']","Went later in the day from 2-5. didnt make it to the waterfall, too muddy and was over the overgrown trail. glad I wore pants. only water in the beginning of the trail for the dogs. then last .5 mile was sooo muddy. walking back the water was surrounded with bees. there was also a rattler right in the middle of the trail on thr way back. didnt rattle at us. 1okay scenery. hike was uphill the whole way. an okay hike."

3,2019-07-06,['hiking'],Great trail! It’s nice and shaded majority of the time!  Lost of streams and nice bridges. Great views the higher you get! My dog loved it!
4,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'over grown']",I did this hike to explore it and see where it leads.  This trail is uphill all the way in.  After a mile some down trees are on the trail but it’s easy to get around. At 1.6 miles I was bushwhacking my way through and called it enough.  It is evident that not many people take this trail.  If you want solitude then this is the trail for you.
5,2019-06-12,['hiking'],"I hike with my 6-year-old, 3-year-old, and other young families, so keep that in mind when weighing my review. We loved this hike. We completed only the first 1.1 miles of this hike and then turned around. The whole way we were under the cover of the trees, so it was nice and shaded. The very beginning of the hike was a bit steep and narrow, but nothing that made me too nervous with my little kids. We got to see the stream often, which made it interesting for the kids. We did accidentally split off onto Indian Trail, rather than continuing on the Cold Water trail. Watch out for where the trail splits maybe about 3/4 mile in (before the bridge). The smaller trail that goes off to the left is the continuation of Cold Water Trail. While the bigger, more obvious trail puts you on Indian Trail."
6,2019-06-04,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'over grown']","This was an okay hike. When you get to the fork in the trail left will be the Cold Water Canyon Trail. At this point the trail becomes overgrown, trees down across the trail. Pretty much foot traffic is what is keeping this trail visible, otherwise one would assume it is abandoned. The last part of the trail is a climb and it was muddy. We were not able to complete the trail because of the mud. We did run into a Great Basin Gopher Snake."
7,2019-05-28,[''],This is a beautiful hike.  It is less used than many other trails in the area so it is a little overgrown but not bad. It stays in the bottom of the canyon along the steam  the entire time.  It offers great views of the white cliffs up above and The mountains across 12th Street. Much of the trail is slightly muddy now but the last few hundred feet are terribly muddy.  There are several little places to camp along the way.  All snow is gone.

9,2019-04-19,"['hiking', 'snow']",Snow just after rivers merge. Could not go to end. Still a great hike by the water.
10,2019-03-12,[''],Snowy and icy but so worth the hike.
11,2018-10-15,['hiking'],"Great hike, lots of trees, can do just this hike or add Indian Trail into it."
12,2018-08-24,['hiking'],"After the fork ( don’t go across bridge, that’s Indian trail) trail quickly becomes over grown , almost disappears at times. It was like the trail was playing hide and seek. Towards the end the “trail” is a dried creek(?) bed and very steep and rocky. If your waiting for the grand finale at the end, you’ll be disappointed. It’s pretty closed in with almost no views. This was my first and last time using this very primitive trail."
13,2018-08-17,['hiking'],"Good hike with lots of shade. Unfortunately, there are no signs so we ended up on Indian trail. We backtracked and finally took the saw mill route. Had to bushwhacked but did not make it to the end - it got very muddy and we saw fresh moose tracks. Ended up hiking 5.2 miles round trip."
14,2018-06-30,[''],"A trail maintained mainly by peoples feet, gets pretty overgrown after the first bridge and you have to take a left off the main trail before the second bridge. Also may want to wear jeans or long sleeve for the hike."
15,2018-06-18,[''],"first part is intense uphill and you can hear traffic. after about a half mile the sound of water downs out the traffic and it becomes nice. not a whole lot of people, but you are surrounded by trees for the most part so you don't see a whole lot of grand views."
16,2018-05-23,['hiking'],"cool hike and covered from the sun, which was really nice! giving three stars because we only made it about a mile in before we came across two rattlesnakes on the trail within 20 feet of each other. the second one coiled and rattled at my husband and baby, fortunately didn’t attack. we turned around pretty quickly. just be careful and aware of your surroundings!"
17,2017-10-02,['hiking'],"After climbing quickly near the canyon road, the trail leveled out some and became quiet. it was a nice trail and we only saw a couple people."
18,2017-08-25,['mountain biking'],Fun ride!
19,2017-07-25,['hiking'],Easy to go into Indian Trail. Had to backtrack after looking at the map. Lots of coverage from the sun and it wasn't too hot. I like that the trail is dog-friendly and we hardly saw anyone while hiking.
20,2017-07-13,['hiking'],Very pretty hike. Definitely the road less traveled the same trail head goes into Indian trail. The trail is overgrown and places and I never did get to a place that was open nice in the heat of the day.
21,2017-06-17,['hiking'],"only a small trek today, as far as the Indian Trail cut off. ..Lots of fun"
22,2017-04-10,[''],"READ PHIL HUNTS REVIEW!!
Stunning view, but almost impossible to trek in even late March because of the snow. The trail map currently on Alltrails as of March 26th is wrong, and stops half way though. I'm not sure if the trail was actually difficult, or I wasn't on the trail. There's no trail markers except right at the beginning. 

For that reason, I give this trail 4 stars. I'd honestly give it 3 stars, but I could have been wrong."
23,2016-10-15,[''],"I gave this hike 4 stars instead of 5 because it's difficult to find the ""end"", easy to get lost bc there are no trail markers and the last half mile or so could only loosely be referred to as a trail. You should definitely read Phil's review below. He did an awesome job describing the hike and what to expect. The hike itself is absolutely amazing. I'd love to do it with someone who knows where it goes and ends. This is a perfect hike for an autumn day. The environment is majestic and I only saw a few people and that was near the trailhead during the last 10 minutes or so. I hiked up about 3.3 miles and found a large rock in the drainage ditch to sit and have lunch on. The view of the canyon was spectacular and completely took my breath away. I loved this hike. If you aren't comfortable unless you're on a well defined trail, I would choose another hike. But if you're looking for a robust hike with amazing views and a bit of scrambling up rocks and a little bush whacking, do this hike. It is well worth it!"
24,2016-09-21,['hiking'],"To get to cold water canyon drive up Ogden canyon to the Smoky Bear sign , parking lot is on the South side. Hike .8 miles up Indian Trail the Trail Head to Cold Water is the left fork.. Continue climbing upward the trail comes to a ""T"" turn left at the ""T"" to continue up cold water canyon .. Turning right at the T takes you to a few camping spots with fire pits . Soon you will arrive at the old Mill , there will be old steel parts left from the mill ( please leave them there) 
Turning left the trail continues to climb upward finally turning into a muddy drainage .. Continue threw this for about 69 ft back on a trail then going into a drainage wash . Continue scrambling up and over the rocks , logs & branches until reaching the top . Some bush whacking.. 
Total mileage from parking lot to top of trail is 3 miles . Stunning views from up the drainage .     
Please pack out what you packed in .."
25,2016-08-23,[''],"Visiting from Nevada, was a great trail with a great view of the city! air is defiantly thinner up here hahaha!"
26,2016-07-18,['hiking'],"Good trail at the start stay to the right where it splits with Indian trail . It's a pretty hike and is all shaded . At the top Ithe gps  trail stops but the trail continue s it's a bit of bush whacking and I went quite a bit up , would like to see where the trail leads to but it will have to wait till some other time ."
27,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"Really nice trail, we ended up connecting to Indian Trail and going to the top!! Really good trail, slight incline, and in some places on the path there's rocks. It was me and my 3 & 7 yr old and I only had to carry my 3 yr old part of the way back down. Lots of shade, but I wouldn't take a dog past where the water ends unless you bring enough for them too!!"
28,2016-06-08,[''],"Really pretty hike and nicely shaded. I'll definitely be doing this one again! It stays steadily steep on the way up which was a little rough with my out-of-shape self, but going down is easy."
29,2016-06-08,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful trail. It will leave you wanting more. Going again ASAP!
30,2016-06-05,['hiking'],Beautiful area. Gonna be going again next weekend great hike.
31,2016-04-17,['hiking'],Great hike!
32,2015-05-25,['hiking'],Gorgeous!
33,2015-05-13,['hiking'],"This trail doesn't give you much time to warm up, right out of the parking lot you start a steady climb up this amazing trail. With in the first mile you will have gained 1,000 feet. The lower portion of this trail gets a lot of use, but the upper half see's a lot less people. If you have never hiked this trail beyond the Indian Trail turn off I would highly suggest you do so. You will be rewarded with a maple canopy to keep the sun off and no sounds from the city find there way to the upper potion. True gem of Ogden area!"
34,2015-04-29,['hiking'],This is a great hike to take the family and even do a overnight camp.  The area is nice and lush and most camp spot are near the water.  This is a great place any time of year.
