The Y portion of the trail is very steep and immediately gets your heart going. Trail evens out a bit after the Y for a rocky portion, it then gets over grown with lots of tasty plants (to bugs) - bring (electrolyte) water, sun block and bug repellent -3 hours later, we were standing in front of Provo’s peak thinking that it was not that bad, it had actually been very pleasant on this sunny day. Provo’s revenge was just minutes away (I get goosebumps thinking about it).  My husband and I are runners, but Provo soon forced us to slowdown and were taking breaks every 30 feet or so - insane - the good thing though is that with every break we got to enjoy a beautiful day with espectacular views of lake Provo, mount Timpanogos and other surrounding peaks.  It took 3 hours to get to the summit from Provo’s base. We had lunch near top (lots of flies on the summit) and made it back to the base in 1 hour.  On our way back husband started to get cramps- bad ones, on large muscle groups- and we knew it would be a slow return. 11 hours later, we were back in the car. We clocked 16 miles on our phone app. "

Flat tires for everyone. Anyway still takes me about 3hrs up and 2 down. Steep steep steep. I usually take binoculars for wildlife along the way as well. "
2,2019-08-28,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble']","I tried this hike yesterday  (8-22) from the y trail and made it to the saddle, about 600 feet from the summit of provo peak (and did a detour to the y mountain). Firstly, this hike is no joke. I hike tough peaks often and this destroyed me. I  was fine until I was half way up the climb to the summit.  I got a bad case of altitude sickness (1st time ever) and incredibly bad cramps (also first time) and couldn't finish. The change in elevation is drastic, around 1k per mile starting immediately.  The most I ever did before this was lone peak and king's peak, this trumps both. I would only recommend this if you are in insanely good shape! you can cut mileage off if you take the road past the rock canyon campground, but I wanted the full shebang. additionally, the trail can be hard to find in a few places, with quick turns through highly overgrown areas. all trails maps only marginally helped her!! bring an insane amount of water. I brought less than usual because I had a life straw, but found no water source on the hike. I'd never do this again, but it was beautiful! for most people, I'd recommend just summiting y mountain and calling it a day."
3,2019-08-14,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Crazy climb, but the view was AMAZING! It feels amazing when you reach the top because you know that you conquered that crazy mountain. "
4,2019-08-14,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Beautiful hike with beautiful views! As described, it goes straight up! Plan on full beast mode going up and a steep knee crusher descent. I would recommend long pants given the multitude of bees in the wildflowers and the thick brush. Pay close attention to the reviews which describe how to get to the upper trailhead on the squaw peak road. Very helpful!  Recommend!!"

6,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","If you drive up Provo Canyon and take what I believe is called Squaw Peak Road, you can get to the bottom of the mountain without having to hike the Y trail or go through Slide Canyon. This probably cuts 2/3 of the distance off, and leaves you with only the steepest portion--the final ascent. It's steep and rocky, and you have to hike without a trail for a while until you reach the main ridge that you follow to the top. It's a lot of fun and worth the sweat. Great views from the top on both sides of you go when it's not cloudy."
7,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"We summited Provo Peak via Rock Canyon TH, this makes the trip significantly longer. However it was a great hike and the views were spectacular. "
8,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'snow', 'washed out']","Hiked up today. We started from Squaw Peak Road but couldn’t make it all the way to the Provo peak trailhead in our Subaru because there’s a huge pothole that makes it impossible to pass that point. We walked up the Squaw Peak Road from the Provo Canyon side for about 2 miles before reaching the trailhead. It’s not a super long hike, but it’s a brutal one that almost had us turn back a couple times. There’s 3 false peaks that were pretty discouraging and there’s still a couple snowfields that you have to cross. We got caught in a snowstorm at the top and it was hard getting down. Overall, still a good hike. I’d recommend waiting a week or two before trying it. I think we were still a little early on in the season."
9,2019-06-11,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","Took the squaw peak road and cut off quite a bit of the actual hike, but this was a very very fun hike. It’s very steep so be prepared to climb wayyy up. There is still some snow but it’s fairly packed down so no need for snow shoes. The views from the summit are absolutely stunning. This is a very underrated peak! Highly recommend it."
10,2019-05-29,[''],"One of the tallest peaks in the area, it is worth the climb. You will usually only pass a couple people on the trail so enjoy the quiet trail and come prepared for the last 2 miles to hike up and up and up! "
11,2019-05-16,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Did this hike last summer in July with a group. The last half a mile was rough, and I started getting altitude sickness but ended up making it with slow progress. Beautiful wild flowers all along the trail and a beautiful view at the top. "
12,2018-09-17,['hiking'],"Drove up squaw peak road and started from there which cut out a good chunk of the hike. Ended up being only about 2 miles each way for us, but a brutal two miles. Not the prettiest but definitely worth it!"
13,2018-08-20,['hiking'],"Whew that was a doozy! I started at the Hike the Y Parking Lot. Took Slide Canyon up and connected with Squaw Peak Road. Despite reading the reviews I STILL missed the damn cairn! Keep a careful eye for it lest you will have to resort to backtracking or bushwhacking straight up the mountain like I did! Definitely arduous and a good test of endurance, but well worth it! 

Ascent : 4 Hours 45 Minutes 

Descent : 2 Hours"
14,2018-07-08,[''],We went up via Slate Canyon and it was gorgeous! It adds an extra mile or so but well worth it. The final ascent is about 2500 ft of elevation gain over the last mile and a half so prepare yourself! Drink lots of water the day before to avoid cramping like I did! I’ve done around 15 peaks in Utah and this is by far the hardest. That being said it was absolutely gorgeous and worth the effort
15,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"The wildflowers were beautiful as was the view.  As previous people have said, don't miss the carin.  My friend and I did and we ended up bush wacking up the side.  Stay on the right side of the edge.  We also did it from Slate Canyon.  That was the prettier overall part of the hike though the views were better from Provo summit.  If you have a vehicle that could drive up Squaw peak road, that would be the recommended route."
16,2018-06-23,[''],"Holy moly this hike should have an extra hard rating. Squaw Peak and Big Baldy are rated hard and those are not as hard as this one. 
This trail takes no time getting steep. I drove up the Squaw Peak Rd and started there (high clearance highly recommended). Hike over some rolling hills up a dirt road then there is a cairn that points you up a narrow trail to your right - don’t miss it. You’ll hike through heavy brush and straight sun before it gets to rock trail that’s pretty much a stair climber. Then it’s scree. Lots of loose scree. And all in exposed sun. Only tender mercy is a good wind blows once you get out of the heavy shrubs. 
There are 3 false summits which was mentally taxing for me.
Bring PLENTY of water and mentally prepare yourself for a no mercy uphill grind.  
Took the dogs up - don’t take yours if they aren’t used to loose scree and don’t handle heat/straight sun well. 
Outstanding views overall though and tons of wildflowers! No snow (6/22/18)"
17,2018-06-11,[''],hiked from the Y trailhead. the trails are easy to fallow and well marked. the stack of rocks that marks the way up to the summit was a big help and I got that from another review thanks. I went in a Sunday and only saw 5 people. I loved that hike in June.
18,2018-05-08,[''],This hike was one that more people should do. I started from Rock Canyon to the top. Snow and mud started about half way up Rd. 60. Took the west ridge which had snow up to my wasit when post holded happened randomly. Half way up the ridge I was beginning to think this was a bad idea until the snow started to turn into more ice. Was the first one of this yr according to the log book. The views we're just as good as Timp if not better. This hike will break you off if you do the whole thing and not cheat by starting from Rd 60.
19,2017-09-08,['hiking'],"This was an amazing hike.   We live in Spanish Fork area, and drove out Dodge Durango up to where the trail crosses the squaw peak road.   Through Hobble creek canyon and around.  The road was bit sketchy in some points lots of big rocks and huge washouts.   A standard car I don't think would make it.   Starting in Spanish Fork and driving up Hobble creek it took us about 1.5 hours, to get to where trail crosses the Squaw Peak Road.   There is a loop around and it is fairly obvious the Jeep / ATV trail heads up on the East, which is the trail.

If you travelled in a Razr or ATV you could cut some distance and time off.   We parked on the Squaw Peak road.   We hiked up the double track and thanks to Matt Faraday's comments we didn't miss the trail heading off to the right.  There is a descent sized cairn there now.   The trail to the right is about 300 yards beyond the large Quaking Aspen grove the double track heads through.   I posted a picture of the cairn.

We are not in extreme physical fitness, just moved here from Missouri.   It took us 3 hrs to get to the top with lots of rests to breathe.  The top was great, though vision limited by smoke from fires all around.   Took us 1.75 hrs to descend.  Folks who are in good shape will likely be much faster.   

After we drove the Durango on the squaw peak road towards Provo canyon which took about an hour.   I can see how a low clearance vehicle would have difficulties.  Overall a great day."
20,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"Loved it! The only downside is the road to get to the trailhead, if you want to skip hiking the Y and Slide Canyon first. I took my VW Passat up the road and nearly got stuck. We made it, however, and really enjoyed the hike. The road was such slow going though, in a car, that it took us two hours from the mouth of Provo Canyon up Squaw Peak Road to the trailhead. If you have a car with some decent clearance you could do it much more quickly. 

The trailhead to Provo Peak has a turn-around and a place to park your car. You'll see a sign on the west side of the turn-around for Slide Canyon and Slate Canyon. Hike up the small road directly east across Squaw Peak Road for about a quarter mile before the narrow, steep trail to the summit takes off up the hill to the right. It's easy to miss. If the double-track road turns to single-track you've missed the trail to the summit. If you have a GPS I'd suggest downloading the route GPX file in advance so you don't miss the trail.

It's really steep, and the 1.76 miles took much longer than anticipated to get to the summit (3.5 hours, with a little detour and pretty regular rest. 1.5 hours down), but was well worth the effort. To the north the summit of Timpanogos is a similar elevation, to the northeast Midway (I think) is visible in the distance, to the west you can see Provo and Utah Lake over Y Mountain, to the south you can follow Squaw Peak Road to Springville and Spanish Fork, with Mount Nebo in clear view as well. To the east is just spectacular mountain scenery. I was surprised by how comparable this Peak is to Timpanogos and Nebo in elevation. And now having hiked Provo Peak I can call myself a real Provoan!"
21,2017-07-23,['hiking'],Provo Peak fits well in the difficult category as it is very steep and a moderate distance.  The wild flowers were fantastic and the view to the East was amazing.  I would recommend this hike to anyone willing to put in the effort to enjoy the beauty of the place.
22,2017-07-05,['hiking'],Amazing view from the summit. I started at the Y mountain trailhead and it was a little over 7 miles to the summit. The first 5 miles are beautiful and not too hard. After you get passed Squaw Peak road it gets pretty brutal. I am in very good shape and I had to take a lot of breaks. It also gets technical due to loose rocks and the steepness grade. It took me five hours from the Y mountain trailhead to get to the summit.
23,2017-02-03,['hiking'],"Started from the trail head on Squaw Peak Road, which made this hike easier, but still very difficult. 3000 vertical feet in 1.5 miles is pretty insane, so be prepared. The view though is worth it. Only saw one other group hiking."
24,2016-11-13,['hiking'],"First time on this trail. Started at Y Mountain parking lot.  Did not track mileage but 6 miles each way seemed right.  I would rate as harder than Timp via the Timpanooke route.  The last couple miles are somewhat brutal but doable. Stairclimber from Hades is a proper description. But.....The view is definitely worth it!!!!  Did not find a survey marker defining summit; not sure on that.
Hiking poles are a must unless you have young knees, especially going down.  Trail is easy enough to see, just need to keep eyes open on the mountain going up.  Got lucky with early-mid November weather, was gorgeous.  Bottom line, all the pain and discomfort were so worth it!!!! We can do hard things!!"
25,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"Stair climber from Hades! I started from the trailhead on Squaw Peak road and it was straight up from there (actually, after you leave the ATV trail).  Hiking poles are a must, mainly for the descent. Beautiful view."
26,2016-06-13,['hiking'],"This hike is a beast. But, it provides a beautiful view of Y Mountain, Squaw Peak, and the entire valley. Very hard, but well worth the effort."
27,2016-05-02,[''],This hike is beatiful but also a monster.  lots of loose shale and steep grade the whole way from the Squaw Peak Road.  The views are well worth the effort though.
28,2016-05-01,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike!  My favorite hike in Utah County.  Traffic is light (you'll probably be the only one on the trail).  The higher you get the more technical things become so do not attempt this hike unless you are 1) very fit and hav good knees, 2) have a fit hiking buddy with good knees, and 3) a whole day to do it."
29,2016-02-22,['hiking'],"Wonderful hike, often overlooked, but worth it. Hike is straight up to a beautiful summit that overlooks the Valley and towards wallsburg on the other side. Hiked it in the fall so there was snow maybe half way up. Lots of false summits, 4wd in."
30,2015-10-11,[''],I love this hike because you can take a 4WD right up to the base of the peak on squaw peak road then hike a mile at a steep 45 degree angle right to the top. Very challenging. Bring water and maybe a jacket at the top.
31,2015-08-04,['hiking'],"Provo Peak, at 11,066 feet is the only 11,000 feet peak between popular Mount Timpanogos and Mount Nebo. It is often overlooked, but it's a great short hike. 

Hikers access the trail from Squaw Peak Road and or can start at Y parking area, and take the Slide Canyon Trail (Trail 062) which goes past the Y and up between Y Mountain and Maple Mountain, and then up and over Lion Head. Trail 062 will take you all the way up to the top of Provo Peak after it crosses the rough Squaw Peak Road. Starting from the Y parking area with make this close to an 8 mile hike round trip, whereas driving Squaw Peak and starting where Trail 62 intersects the rough road will make about a 2.6 mile roundtrip hike.

No switchbacks on this trail! Goes straight up the west ridge. Also, don't be fooled by the numerous false summits! Great hike. Every time I've done this hike, I've always had the whole trail to myself. Beautiful views looking east down to the cirque below and toward Wallsburg.

32,2015-07-10,['hiking'],"Great Hike, amazing view from the top, not much traffic. really steep. make sure you watch for the pile of rocks (poorly built cairn) a 0.5 miles in on the right hand side of the ATV road to find the trail up. also make sure you have 4 wheel drive if you're going to drive up squaw peak road."
