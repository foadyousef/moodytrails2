I went over and down through rock canyon. The trail gets a bit confusing as you come down through the camp sights, but follow the signs for 060 and you should be alright."
1,2018-09-03,['hiking'],A very pretty trail with gorgeous views. We left in the morning and were in the shade most of the way up. The last couple miles are incredibly steep. We passed a gang of dirt bikers coming down so the dirt was especially loose. Wear good shoes and bring plenty of water.
2,2018-08-29,['hiking'],"Great hike! The first half of the hike has gradual with occasional steep ascents, and the second half has steep with occasional gradual climbs. Narrow trail at times, but very well defined and easy to follow. Amazing views from the top!"
3,2018-07-31,['hiking'],"Amazing hike! Beautiful wildflowers and great view. Trail is easy to follow. I am in reasonably good shape, but certainly not trail running shape & I made it up in just under 2 hours. Definitely recommend it."
4,2018-07-15,['hiking'],Trail is in very good shape. Empty at 5:30am with everyone else is asleep. Can make this a loop by taking the Shingle Creek Trail and the Great Western trail back to the trailhead. Adds only 1.5 miles to the day.

6,2018-06-16,['hiking'],Super windy on the saddle. Be prepared and bring an extra layer or two.
7,2018-06-11,['hiking'],"I loved it. There was still snow in June so I made a snowman. Only in the last mile and not on the trail, so I enjoyed the snow. Last mile and a half got very steep. I only had one water bottle and one kind bar. I definitely needed a little more juice. I ran out of energy so I walked a lot. Once yo go past the 3 miles, there are very few hikers or almost no one. It took me around 30,000 steps."
8,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"Great hike today! Made it up in 2 hrs and 10 mins. Back down was a little over an hour. Climbed the snow that was left in the basin before you turn left to reach the summit. Beautiful views from the top, was the only one up there today. Peaceful."
9,2017-09-30,['hiking'],"Started at big springs park and hiked through rock canyon. We hit some snow but we made it through fine. Beautiful views, gorgeous colors this time of year, and a lot of fun hiking all the way through!"
10,2017-09-17,['hiking'],My boyfriend and I hiked all the way through from Big Springs to Rock Canyon. We stopped to camp in Rock Canyon and my phone died so I was unable to finish recording our trip. I would say it's about 12 miles. The hike was great! Definitely hard though and when we stopped to camp we had gone 8 miles mostly uphill so our legs were on fire. Late September is a great time to go because the weather was perfect and the changing trees are at their peak. I've always loved Rock Canyon and Big Springs so it was great connecting the two.
11,2017-08-04,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail! We started from the Big Springs trailhead and it took us about 6 hours roundtrip to the saddle and back. There were so many wildflowers and butterflies the whole way and the trail was really lush and green. Right before the saddle we did have to cross a small snowfield that was a little sketchy but other than that we didn't really run into any issues. We started very early in the morning but by the time we were headed back it was very hot. The hike was pretty steep at parts and there is alot of loose rock so I would recommend bringing poles for this one if you have them. We each slipped a few times on the way down without poles. Overall the hike was easier than I anicipated and actually not as steep as some of the reviews led me to believe. That being said, this is not a great hike for beginners. If it weren't for the longer distance, I personally would only rate this a moderately difficult hike. While some of the steep parts are incredibly steep, the trail levels out frequently. Great hike, the views at the saddle are amazing and well worth the time it takes to get there."
12,2017-06-08,['hiking'],Tried to hike this last Saturday. The trail is well trafficked in the beginning. Once you get up a ways there is a lot of snow still. There has clearly been some avalanches this winter that have covered some of the trail with trees. There was still some good avalanche danger so we turned back.
13,2016-08-08,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. We hiked to the saddle and spent the night. Then, we hunted over to Cascade Peak, which was grueling. I suggest bringing a lot of water. We basically team out when we arrived back at the saddle from Cascade Peak and we basically had 2L of water and 1L of POWERade. But, we came down the Big Springs trail quick enough to drink from the spring. The hike to the saddle is something I'd consider doing again and continuing on the other side and through Rock Canyon to Provo. But, it would take a lot for me to do Cascade Peak again. If I do, I will do it via Dry Fork, since it is shorter than Big Springs."
14,2016-07-21,['hiking'],"Absolutely fantastic trail. It follows a dirt road for the first mile and a half to what looked like a campground, and then begins its journey into the wilderness. The first part is all crisscrossed with other trails and campsites, so it can be a little confusing. Just keep going forward following the road and you'll be fine.

I didn't see another person the whole hike after the dirt road, plus lots of vegetation, steep hillsides, green basins, and a nice view of the wilderness from the saddle. This was everything I look for in a hike.

No mosquitoes, but the flies (deer flies?) bite, so watch out."
15,2015-10-01,['hiking'],"The trail is gorgeous. I don't think you could really ask for more in a trail, except make a stream or some water source. It was shaded a good deal of the time. Well maintained, easy trail to follow. There were a few sections of loose rock, which were hard to get down without sliding a bit. The trail is pretty difficult, as far as grade. It's pretty consistently steep, but the last mile before the saddle is especially steep. The views from the saddle make it worth it. Be prepared and bring a lot of water, there isn't any on the trail once you leave the Big Springs area."
16,2015-06-14,[''],"Went up from rock canyon and continued to the saddle (8 mi), and then headed down the big springs trail (8 mi). Some of the best views so far, absolutely loved it. Going down was a bit sketchy since there was still a TON of snow -- ended up losing the trail for a mile or two and sliding down in the snow drainage ditches. Wouldn't recommend going down that way... not too many people, didn't see people for about three hours when I was up about the saddle. Big spring trail leads out to Vivian park in Provo canyon."
17,2015-06-14,['hiking'],"One of the toughest trails in the Uintahs in my opinion. Super beautiful the whole way and the saddle brings awesome views of a number of different peaks. From the saddle you can hook up to dry fork trail which connects to rock canyon. You can also walk along the ridge line to the different peaks on cascade. This trail is deceptively steep and long. Worth the hike of you're an experienced hiker and in good shape. 

You also are pretty isolated. I spent some time in my hammock at the saddle and was on the mountain for about 8 hours. Outside of a mile or so from the trailhead I saw one person."
18,2014-06-08,['hiking'],"Started at Big Springs park, to Cascade Saddle, then down to Rock Canyon.  First week of June there was still lots of snow near the peaks, and an avalanche wiped out the trail, necessitating a little tracking of some game trails to find our way. Took more like 7.5 hrs due to my hiking buddy getting a little altitude sickness."
19,2013-12-29,['hiking'],"I encountered this trail on my way up to Big Springs and decided to keep going once I reached the springs. It was such a beautiful trail the entire way up, so many wild flowers and so green! The saddle sits you at a beautiful view of Provo Peak and all the steps along the mountain side. I'm almost positive the trail continues to Provo Peak. "
