0,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"The first 4 or so miles of this trail are great. Lots of shade/cool/plenty of water. However, the last half is pretty brutal this time of year. It’s very dry and hot. We got into a pretty stressful situation with our dogs doing this trail after not being aware of the fact that it’s very very dry once you leave the Icebox area of the trail. If you do this trail this time of year make sure you know this and are prepared with dogs that are used to heat stressful conditions and that you have PLENTY of water. We were carrying about 5-6 liters of water and still got close to running out from trying to keep the dogs cool. Probably better used when it’s significantly cooler outside especially since things are pretty dead and the views are not particularly spectacular. The trail is also marked wrong in two places, as you leave the icebox the trail is blocked and leads you up some switchbacks instead of going straight. As you come to the second road, you should go right towards the bathrooms instead of left at the head of the marked trail.  "
1,2019-08-08,['hiking'],I really enjoyed taking the Icebox part down the loop. It was so cool and refreshing! This hike was a bit easier than I anticipated... it took about an hour and a half. The creek was beautiful and the jaunt through the tall grass felt like Elysium.
2,2019-07-31,['hiking'],Trail was good and you can see a lot of the improvements they are in the middle of on it.
3,2019-07-20,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Ice Box trail is the best part. It is along the creek and in the shade.  About 2 miles from the trailhead going along the ice box trail is the only part that is worth it. Very beautiful and not too difficult. 
4,2019-07-18,['hiking'],I would recommend this trail. It has plenty of shade and areas to rest for picnics or just enjoying the beautiful nature. 
5,2019-07-12,['hiking'],Great for dogs and beginner hikers! There can be wildlife on the trail so mind your step and leave nature alone. 
6,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky']",Did this today. Great trail! Area by the river is awesome. Other side of the loop is british countryside-esque. At least 3 mi is thick mud but hikeable. Dog got a leech on her at one point. We’re not crazy hikers and were able do this in under 4.5 hrs. Beginning-ending 1mi is really hot and exposed but the rest is shady and nice.
7,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"If you are interested in this hike due to the view associated with the front page picture you might want to reconsider. I am not sure where this picture was taken. Nice hike but you are not rewarded with many ""great"" views. "
8,2019-05-29,[''],Great trail! Pretty muddy in spots but still very enjoyable.
9,2019-05-25,['hiking'],Great trail 10 minutes from Ogden. Follows the creek all the way through the canyon. 
10,2019-05-19,"['hiking', 'blowdown', 'muddy', 'washed out']",Extremely muddy once you get down to wheeler creek from the parking lot
11,2019-05-10,['hiking'],cut it short on snowbasin road but there's some nice meditation spots. Friday afternoon was empty. cheers!
12,2019-05-10,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'washed out']",It was pretty muddy on the Ice Box Canyon loop and part was starting to wash away.  Still a great hike!
13,2019-01-20,"['snowshoeing', 'snow']","Very nice trail with gentle incline. Be careful where you park though! They were towing cars at the trailhead for parking in a ""fire lane"". There is no additional parking on the shoulder of the narrow canyon road allowed, so arrive early. It seems to be a busy trailhead, although there is enough trail that you could still get some quiet time to your self."
14,2018-10-21,['hiking'],Beautiful fall hike.
15,2018-09-03,['hiking'],Pleasant trail with nice views. Heavily traveled though withs lots of bikers who you constantly need to jump out of the way for.
16,2018-08-26,['hiking'],"This is part of network of trails and you can do all kinds of different loops, out and backs, or even point to points using different trailheads. You would be wise to have a map. There are at least 2 other AllTrails entries for parts of this network. It 's a nice setting. The trails are used by mountain bikers, so they are all very easy to hike with no super steep parts. In places it is really a road. I started at the trailhead off of Rt 39, right by Pineview Resevoir, as shown here. For some reason, the trailhead looked like a homeless encampment this morning."
17,2018-08-15,['trail running'],Beautiful trail!!
18,2018-08-06,['hiking'],"This hike starts off next the river but looses it about 1.5 miles and it gets hot! We started in the morning but by afternoon there wasn't a lot of shade. I was confused by the trail markers, I was looking for wheeler trail but in the middle of the hike all you see are signs for Maple or icebox. I just kept going south in hopes of going the right way. We didn't make it to the end because we ran out of time, maybe someday in the fall."
19,2018-08-05,['hiking'],Nice and cool along the creek.
20,2018-07-31,['hiking'],"This trail is awesome! I can't believe I've lived in Ogden most of my life and never tried it out before.  We only hiked about 3 miles of it, but it was beautiful and mostly shaded.  Very easy trail at the beginning, but I've heard it can get steeper and harder the further you go (will update when I have more info). This would be great as a beginner mountain bike trail. I plan to come back and try it out for that."
21,2018-07-19,['hiking'],Wouldn't recommend during the heat of the day
22,2018-07-15,['backpacking'],"Only went 3 miles, nice hike."
23,2018-06-16,['horseback riding'],definitely my favorite trail to take the horses! gone here since I was little. love it! Very little traffic.
24,2018-06-08,[''],We did this trail yesterday and the meadows were full of wildflowers. It was wonderful!
25,2018-06-01,['hiking'],"Great hike, especially for warmer months as there is a lot of shade along most parts of the trail. It’s pretty popular with bikers, but it’s great for a casual hike."
26,2018-05-30,['hiking'],Great steady incline with beautiful wildflowers. My small dogs and kid can do it so it’s pretty moderate for sure.
27,2018-05-02,['hiking'],"Great 2 mile hike if you go to Nort parking lot and back and don't take the full loop. it was pretty, and an easy hike with kids. I just didn't enjoy how extremely heavily trafficked it was. However, it is very dog friendly!"
28,2018-04-28,['hiking'],"Had a bad day, work was a pain, hit the trail to work some stuff out.. heard this was a busy trail, only passed one runner. Saw a moose, rode it, day got better."
29,2018-04-25,['walking'],Nice uphill climb and easy wide trail.  Love the waterfalls and creek. Great walk. Lots of bikers.
30,2017-10-16,[''],Beautiful trail but pretty rocky and heavy traffic.
31,2017-08-25,['hiking'],"Amazing hike, went with friends and they all enjoyed too!"
32,2017-08-20,['mountain biking'],"Only Wheeler Creek Trail plus East Fork Mtn Bike as warm up to XTerra.  Lower part is a gravel, rocky road, nothing special and super crowded.  Meadow up top is nice with good views.  Did as a training ride for XTerra, good workout. Fun descent.  Wouldn't do this for any other reason than I did.  Other much more pretty less crowded places to go."
33,2017-08-06,['mountain biking'],"Started on Wheeler, went all the way up to SnowBasin, came down Maple trail. This is the most fun downhill that I have ever had on my bike! 

The reason that i gave 3 out of 5 stars is because it is so EXTREMELY HEAVILY trafficked. I mean seriously. I could hardly go 100 feet without crossing/passing another traveler. Every corner you come to, expect to run into someone. Definitely not a trail to have headphones in on.

overall great. But geez. More crowded that a walmart on black friday."
34,2017-07-20,['hiking'],"By far one of my favorite hikes!! It's shaded and by a stream so it stays pretty cool, even when temps are nearly 100!"
35,2017-07-06,['hiking'],"Started at the Wheeler Creek TH, and went right at the fork to Ice Box canyon. Overall an easy hike; There's usually a moderate amount of traffic - hikers and bikers. Ice Box canyon is great to hike on a hot summer day because a majority of the trail is shaded and is kept cool by the creek it runs along."
36,2017-06-11,['hiking'],WATCH OUT FOR MOUNTAIN BIKERS!
37,2017-06-10,[''],Great hike! Not too difficult but definitely need to watch out for hard core mountain bikers! First 1/4 mile not a lot of shade but after that tons of shade which was nice on a warm day. Definitely going again. Maybe this time we'll hike farther.  Hiked about 1.5 miles then kids were ready to turn around.
38,2017-06-03,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! Beautiful backdrop of snow covered mountains in June. Very green, lush meadows."
39,2017-05-31,['hiking'],Beautiful!
40,2017-05-09,['hiking'],Nice pretty and scenic hike. Not crowded today.  Trail was in pretty good shape.  Moderate fits this difficulty well.  Good length though we cut 1 mile off the back loop by not hiking up snow basin road to find the trail opting to just pick it up lower past the road.
41,2017-05-08,['hiking'],Great moderate hike for families and animals. A lot of the trail is gravel so it's good in the rain. Lovely landscapes in the spring. Perfect for a morning hike.
42,2017-04-30,[''],"Did the full loop today, not many people other than near the bottom. The upper sections were muddy, but that's to be expected since it has rained a lot and the snow hasn't been gone long."
43,2017-04-30,['hiking'],Nice spring hike. Did the whole loop. Was a little muddy.
44,2017-03-26,[''],Love this trail. In the fall it is gorgeous!
45,2017-03-15,['hiking'],
46,2017-01-03,[''],"We brought snowshoes to go up and sledged back down. It's a fun, easy trail! It's also packed enough to not need snowshoes."
47,2017-01-02,[''],really pretty winter hiking
48,2016-09-10,['hiking'],"This is a great trail for a nice, easy to moderate hike. It was very populated, but still fairly easy to navigate. Trail is marked well, however, we did take a ""wrong"" turn at a fork and ended up shortening our hike by about 2 miles. That was a little disappointing, but it was still a great hike with gorgeous views.  My favorite parts were when the trail ran alongside of the river. Such a beautiful sound and serene setting! Would definitely do again if we are ever back in Utah!"
49,2016-09-05,[''],"Get there early for parking, which you can do up by road or down near trail head. Moderate incline going up, nothing hard. Beautiful sights, plenty of trees and shade. There is a bathroom at the top where the trail meets old Snow Basin road. And another trail head in parking lot at top takes you on to Ice Box to loop around. 
The path is fairly rocky, so be care yo with steps while taking in scenery ;)"
50,2016-08-29,['hiking'],Very scenic trail. Very rocky and sometimes narrow. A great trail for both the amateur hiker or experienced hiker.
51,2016-08-29,[''],"great hike! went for the loop around icebox canyon, which id highly recommend"
52,2016-08-27,[''],great simple trail. saw moose last week.
53,2016-08-14,['hiking'],"This is a great little hike, my wife and I strap our 2 year old twins to our bike and head up from the Art Nord parking lot on Old Snowbasin road. We usually hike up to the sign where east fork and middle fork begin (by Green Pond). Expect to see some beautiful mountain views, and don't be surprised if you come across a few deer either, we just spooked up a little four point today. You do share the trail with horses and mountain bikers so be aware and be courteous to them. Most are very courteous and have bells on so you know they're coming up on you. Most importantly have a great time!"
54,2016-07-30,['hiking'],Loved it. Stayed near the river and all the way up to old snow basin road. Will be doing it again!
55,2016-07-16,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail. Im overweight and have asthma, i took my time on a hot day and enjoyed it. i only did a mile in then back, but it was a steady incline so i felt i got a good work out for where i am right now."
56,2016-07-12,[''],beautiful!
57,2016-07-04,[''],"it was fun. great workout, beautiful scenery. it was rocky & technical at parts."
58,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Great trail, easy enough carrying a 3 year old on my back! We hiked up to a split and went over a bridge to a spot with access to the creek, lots of fun for the kids to take a break before going back down!"
59,2016-07-02,['hiking'],Beautiful.
60,2016-06-29,[''],It was an easy hike
61,2016-06-19,[''],Excellent!!! Great reward at the end!!!
62,2016-06-18,[''],Great Family hike.
63,2016-06-15,['mountain biking'],"Stunning views after a gorgeous little river canyon incline.  BUT bikers beware, though the trail is rated easy, this does not hold true for mtn bikers.  It's moderate to challenging depending on which way you go around the loop.  If you head counterclockwise and UP Icebox Canyon it is quite rocky, technical and steep in some sections; far too difficult for the novice or young riders.  Clockwise around the loop would be more enjoyable for sure.  Also, make sure you make note of each fork so that once on the trail, you can choose correctly -- not all the forks are marked.  Enjoy the scenery and watch for hikers when ripping the single track sections."
64,2016-06-13,[''],we loved it!
65,2016-06-12,['mountain biking'],Trail system is awesome. Nice steady incline great views. Awesome ride.
66,2016-06-09,['mountain biking'],"Great ride, much quicker coming down than going up "
67,2016-06-08,[''],very nice trail
68,2016-06-07,['hiking'],It was beautiful!  Trail is very clean.
69,2016-06-05,['hiking'],Great trail easy with beauty everywhere!
70,2016-05-27,['hiking'],"This was our initial hike after recently moving to Utah. My wife, son and I thought the trail was easy to moderate. Some of the hazards are muddy and slick surfaces and some deep erosion on the trail. Beautiful scenery and lots of deer, elk and moose sign along the way."
71,2016-05-16,['hiking'],Very pretty and green.
72,2016-05-13,[''],"Easy, cleanly marked trial"
73,2016-04-24,[''],"One of my favorite all around trails for MTB, hiking or snowshoeing."
74,2015-09-30,['hiking'],"Great trail close to town. This trail can get busy with hikers, bikers and horse back riders. Very easy trail and great for the kiddos."
75,2015-05-20,[''],loved the trail today. the views from the top near art nord trailhead were beautiful with the snow capped mountains. the water rushing in the stream through the canyon was calming.
76,2015-04-19,['hiking'],"I love this canyon - it has some great views, and keeps bringing me back. If you start at the trailhead near the dam, make sure you get there early, because the area fills up fast and the parking situation gets pretty crazy."
77,2015-04-12,['hiking'],"Have hiked this trail many times and will hike it many more. Came out on this day for a nice winter hike, was blessed with hard packed snow so was able to keep the snowshoes in the truck."
78,2015-04-08,[''],"This is a beautiful hike. We ended up going up the river rather than using the trail on a night hike, but it was totally beautiful!"
79,2013-05-12,['hiking'],Nice trail but gets heavy use mainly from mountain bikers.
80,2013-01-06,['hiking'],"I hiked in early December (no snow) the Trail from the Pineview Dam to Icebox Canyon up thru to the snow basin valley then made my way up to the top ofSardine Trail.  My two dogs accompanied me and from 0730 to 2:30 we ran in to nobody until the last 1/2 mile.  First time in years where I spent so many hours in pure silence.  The Trail on parts was very muddy, seen no wildlife but I thought it was a nice hike.  Can't wait to do it in the summer.  At the top I took some pictures (snow was present there) which included Pineview Res. - Mike E."
81,2012-07-23,['mountain biking'],"This a pretty trail that takes you up into the valley of Snowbasin.  The scenery is nice but the trail is an old road that gives it a less natural feel.  Maybe better for beginning Mt. Biking than hiking, but nice for either."
82,2012-06-23,['hiking'],This trail is a little rocky at places but it is a beautiful trail and a great trail for options. 
83,2012-06-13,['hiking'],"This is a very nice trail with great views.  The ponds and benches along the route are nice way to enjoy the surroundings.  This would be a nice place for a family outing and a casual hike.  It did have too much traffic for my taste.  The amount of Bike traffic alone had us hopping on and off the trail quite a bit.  I did have my family and dog with me at the time, which meant looking out for them more than just enjoying the surroundings.  The trail above the ponds and across the main road had a lot less traffic, but still quite busy."
