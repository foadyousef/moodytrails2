0,2019-08-29,['hiking'],The flowers... Oh the flowers 
1,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"Great little hike, my 6yr old and 4yr old enjoyed it as well. Nice shady areas. Beautiful views all around. "
2,2019-07-16,['hiking'],Really a fun trail.  Lots of wildflowers.  The highway leading to Tony Grove Lake is beginning to have some tree and shrub growth on the side of the road encroaching on the shoulders for 7 miles so be careful on your way up.
3,2019-07-14,['hiking'],Non-strenous stroll around a small reservoir. The wildflowers were beautiful!
4,2019-06-28,['hiking'],Awesome place to take the kids! 
5,2019-06-26,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Soo gorgeous up there!! It was a cool 50 degrees and there was a small snow flurry for a few minutes while we were there. My kids (2 and 8) fully enjoyed themselves. we will definitely be back again!
6,2019-06-22,['hiking'],"The road is finally open! There are substantial patches of snow at the south end of the lake, but the trail seems to be open. The forest is carpeted with little yellow glacier lilies."
7,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",starting to get busy already. road is open all the way to the lake  some snow patches on the trail and a little muddy but the trail is open and it's beautiful
8,2019-05-19,['hiking'],"We were surprised to see that we couldn’t even get to the parking lot to hike this trail. We had to park our car about a mile and a half down and hike to the lake.  The road was completely covered with snow.  Hiking boots, shoe grippers and possible snowshoes are still good to have to get to the lake and the lake is completely covered with snow and ice.  There is still enough snow that people were snowmobiling in this area.  Despite the unexpected, it was still beautiful and turned out to be a more moderate hike due to the conditions.  We will definitely come back in a month or so."
9,2018-10-21,['hiking'],"Absolutely gorgeous, even with most of the leaves having fallen. Lake is crystal clear and the surface is like glass. Pretty busy given the weather, but more than enough space to “get away” from others. The far side trail along the lake was muddy, but doable. Just wear hiking boots, not sneaks and you’ll be fine. 

My dog loved splashing and running, others with well behaved pets as well.

Bathrooms as clean as can be expected and odor was minimal. 

Parking was accessible and had enough to go around. 

Road up is a little precious is some areas bc of the shrubs intruding onto the drive path on the sharp turns. 

Will be going back in full winter and spring to enjoy more!"
10,2018-09-06,['hiking'],This was an amazing hike to do with a 4 year old and 2 year old. We went during June and the weather was wonderful. So many wildflowers to look at. We will definitely be back!
11,2018-08-21,['hiking'],"This is a great hike to do with kids (mine are 15, 13 5 and 5).  Beautiful scenery, some rock scrambling, never anything super tricky.  On one end of the loop you can access the lake and play if you want.  So many birds and wildflowers.  Restrooms at the trail head.  We really loved it."
12,2018-08-02,[''],"Did a herb walk at peak flower season.
Most excellent."
13,2018-07-30,[''],"so great for family day, beautifully floral time.
dogs love it...kids love it."
14,2018-07-07,[''],"This is very similar to Bloomington Lake, but the road is paved all the way up to the lake.  The drive is gorgeous.  There were many, including us, taking our kayaks into the water, and many fishermen. It was very quiet and serene.  The air is so fresh and crisp with smells of foliage.  The Cliffs next to the mountain lake is gorgeous.  We went in July and the wildflowers are all in bloom of a rainbow of colors, all around the lake.  On one end we found a large, gorgeous beaver dam with a beaver residing in it and coming out late in the day.  There was a young male moose near there at the edge of the water.  Many people were swimming, the water is very full of plant life and fish and bugs on the water, we did not desire to swim, but wade and kayak and take a quiet break just looking.  On the opposite end is a thick wooded forest with tall evergreens perfect for hiding from the heat of the day and putting up hammocks to take a nap and read. Beyond there is a beautiful campground.  It is worth going and enjoying for all ages.  There is a path around the lake.  On one side it is well worn and cleared that a stroller or wheelchair can even make it around to the forested end.  This is a a gorgeous hidden away spot we fell in love with."
15,2018-06-15,['nature trips'],Great family friendly trail! Our 5yo loves it. I would rate it at moderate on some parts as clamoring over roxks is required.
16,2018-06-05,['hiking'],"this hike was absolutely beautiful around the lake. Although the snow is still heavy there was a lot of places where it was a little difficult to Traverse, mostly because I didn't have the right shoes on but still very doable. It was a gorgeous day and definitely worth the trip!"
17,2018-06-03,[''],So beautiful! Super easy it does get busy in the summer.
18,2018-05-20,[''],"beautiful but easy and short. 
A great place for picnics and just relaxing days by the lake. Not exactly a hiker's trail."
19,2017-10-17,['hiking'],"Fantastic hike. Lots to see and explore. The loop is more moderate than easy especially in October as it was quite wet and muddy. 

Can’t wait to see it in spring!!!!!

Our rating for the loop easy except for the muddy areas."
20,2017-09-13,[''],"View of the lake is great, easy trail"
21,2017-09-09,['walking'],Easy short hike around the lake - wooden pathways are breaking down a bit - be careful.
22,2017-08-07,['hiking'],"By the way, the directions on my gps led me to a road just short of the lake. It's a dirt road and it took us a while to realize we were off track. Follow the paved road all the way up. You will see it!

We took our 2 year old and loved it. It was perfect."
23,2017-07-26,['hiking'],Nice and easy. Well marked and maintained.
24,2017-07-21,[''],"Beautiful short hike! The wildflowers were stunning! I will definitely do this one again, but bring my camera instead of a crappy phone camera."
25,2017-07-13,[''],Beautiful!!
26,2017-07-10,[''],Beautiful! But lots of people.
27,2017-06-23,['walking'],"Been here several times, it's a beautiful drive up and a simple little walk around. I've climbed up into the rocks lining the trail before, super simple and fun. My favorite was on 10.5.15 though because it had just lightly drizzled, no one else was there, and it was just the most serene experience."
28,2017-05-10,['hiking'],Very easy loop around a beautiful lake! kid friendly
29,2017-03-31,[''],this is great for kids. the only issue I had was one part of the trail was washed out the last three times I went. this made for a mucky mess and a guess of navigation.
30,2016-10-17,['walking'],Pretty walk. Nothing difficult.
31,2016-08-29,[''],"A very nice walk. The signs on the trail could do with some maintenance,  and the bridge as well. The walk was very nice and the views are very, very nice."
32,2016-07-30,[''],Pretty walk around the lake. Nice and relaxing
33,2016-07-11,['hiking'],nice walk around the lake.  deepest cave in Utah is here.
34,2016-05-12,[''],This is a nice little trail for a leisurely walk. It circles the lake and often is covered in wildflowers.
35,2015-09-07,['walking'],Excellent little walk.  I really enjoyed the Lake and the breath taking cliffs in the area.  I would Love to return in the spring to see the winter runoff and wild flowers.
36,2015-09-01,[''],"perfect day trip/get away. Beautiful place to just take a break and have some lunch. Also, there are multiple trails leading off into the woods that we didn't explore, but there's always tomorrow."
37,2015-07-20,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike for parents who want to see if their kids are ready for the adventures of hiking. This is a very simple walk around a beautiful mountain lake. We went in mid-June. The flowers were in bloom. The kids enjoyed reading the signs along the way that explain more about the nature of the lake, plants and animals of the region. Many of the signs however need replacing."
38,2015-07-11,['walking'],Nice walk around the lake not a very hard hick. Doesn't have much of a view but beautiful scenery in the summertime or fall.
39,2015-05-26,['hiking'],Nice little hike with lots of flowers.
40,2013-08-15,['hiking'],Great hike for kids around a small lake. Lots of wild flowers!
41,2013-07-08,['hiking'],This is a very easy hike around the lake. I was there on a Saturday. The parking lot was full but the area did not seem crowded. I spent much of my time on the other side of the lake taking pictures and there were very few people there. The flowers are very beautiful and abundant in late June. I got some gorgeous pictures that I included.
42,2012-06-28,['hiking'],"Good trail for kids.  Took my 5 year old twins and 2 year old daughter.  They loved it and had a great time ""sign hunting""."
