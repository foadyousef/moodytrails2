0,2019-09-03,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Nice steep hike on a cloudy day. Lots of inclines with scramble and loose gravel. Bugs at the semi dry riverbed’s. Views of the Salt Lake Valley and Twin Peaks are gorgeous. But when you get to the top it’s pretty much nothing kind of a letdown. The best part was actually the hike itself
1,2019-08-21,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","BEES!!! Lots of em. I brought my dog so i was very cautious of rattlesnakes, didn’t see any, but about 10 mins into the hike (at a popular rock climbing spot) i came across a swarm of agitated bees and a family with 2 young kids who were just stung. Personally bee’s don’t bother me much so I continued, avoiding the bees by going just off trail. The whole way up there were bees on the trail and about an hour or so in we came across another large group of bees & just hiked back down. Bee careful out there."
2,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Swarms of bugs, a surprising amount. Lots of sand and loose terrain. Nice to be close to water though. And shade."
3,2019-08-13,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky']","Steep and awesome!! I’d recommend doing this in the early morning, before people start showing up for climbing, and also before the snakes start coming out. Saw 2 baby rattlesnakes this evening, and couldn’t make it all the way to Storm Mountain, because you really need sunlight to be able to follow the overgrown, upper section of the trail (from the meadow and higher)."
4,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'over grown']","Burner of legs but very good walk, almost at the end the path is covered with weeds, but it is possible to observe a little, you just have to have a good perception of your surroundings"
5,2019-08-03,['hiking'],"Went up yesterday, and made it about 1.5 miles up before getting a little lost on the trail, and had to turn back.  There was a baby ratter just up past the first waterfall. Very shaded for the first mile up, and then very sunny. Made it up to the boulder overlooking the valley and decided to head back down due to time restraints. About a mile up the trial is becoming very overgrown."
6,2019-07-22,[''],Now this is a good burner hike. In and out of the river at the first with some very steep inclines. A lot of elevation gain In a very short time. Trail up past the look out is heavy over growth in many places up to what I think was the end of the trail. Incredible views of the canyon and the valley.
7,2019-06-27,['hiking'],beautiful warm day today. The trail was really slippery with loose gravel please wear a really good shoes and everything is growing in beautifully
8,2019-06-16,['hiking'],"I so wanted to enjoy this hike and say great things. Initially a beautiful shaded hike through the river and pretty wildflowers in bloom, but the trial is just impossible to follow as you approach the meadow. I had great difficulty finding the route and had to back track repeatedly. Very unsettling. Worst part was first almost stepping on gopher snake, hearing a loud hiss 50 feet later, thinking some sort of bug... then 100 feet later hearing another hiss and then seeing a humungous snake rattle of 7 rattles!! This snake was huge.. I was unable to pass and had to turn around only to then discover that the first hiss sound (snake 2) was now out and in strike position. Three snakes, 2 western basin rattlesnakes, and then a fourth snake on the way down . It was far was a relaxing hike to say the least!! "
9,2019-06-13,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'washed out']","The trail is in the river right now. Unless you want to get your feet wet, I wouldn't do this hike for a few more weeks until the melt off slows down. Also the map for this trail is very out of date on this app. The river changes a lot of the trail every year and it needs to be remapped. "
10,2019-06-11,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Loads of fun. The view from the top is incredible and awe inspiring. It was a very wet trail to say the least. Due to early summer melt it was wet and tedious at times but still fun. Bring good shoes for a may or June hike. Very wet but highly enjoyable. 
11,2019-06-09,['hiking'],very fun trail... lots terrain to negotiate and manageable in line.   will be repeating this hike.
12,2019-06-03,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'washed out']","Definitely one of my new favorite hikes...so much pretty everywhere! Trail has a good incline after the initial groomed section. Plan on getting your feet wet! Several river crossings, and right now, with the recent monsoon month, parts of the trail are part of the river. But that made it that much more endearing and exciting! Took our pup and my 13 year old son, who had no issues with the climb. Due to time, we only made it about 2/3 of the way. It was spectacular! Had a few mosquitoes land when we were resting, so bug spray would be good. Only ran into a few people (on a Monday morning), but I can see that it would be super popular on weekends, so do a weekday morning if you can!"
13,2019-05-30,[''],We hiked to the overlook and the trail was in great condition. U just need good shoes and the numerous water crossings will get them wet at some point. Having poles was useful since we were carrying our toddlers. Next time we will check out the trail to the meadows.
14,2019-05-27,['hiking'],It’s fun and a lot of tree cover. Great view if you go up the other way past the fenced radio structure but ut that’s a different trail. That one is very steep. This one is nice and easy and nice and cool near the stream or “river”. Really easy to get to in a car too. The parking lot is pretty small but overflow nearby. 
15,2019-05-19,['hiking'],"Very fun trail. The last part of the trail was covered with snow, spikes would be very helpful."
16,2019-05-19,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","We hit this trail between two downpours. No snow along the first 5/6ths of the way, but we were forced to turn back at that point (close to 2mi) because of an onslaught of hail and rain at the very top. Did not require spikes as most is thawed, but the river crossings became iffy with changing weather conditions. Great views, probably will do this one again soon!"
17,2019-05-18,['hiking'],
18,2019-05-17,['hiking'],Love this trail. Only got about halfway and lost sight of the trail. The river was raging after the rain so I didn’t wanna risk crossing it with the pooch. Will definitely do it again at some point
19,2019-05-14,"['hiking', 'rocky']",This hike is beautiful. I went early so it wasn’t crowded. I could tell on my way out of there this trail gets crowded later in the day. 
20,2019-05-14,['hiking'],Family hike today. Only made it about halfway since we started late in the day. Had to cross a river a few times so my feet got a little wet but it’s a fun canyon! Good places for hammocking along the way.
21,2019-05-13,['hiking'],"Didn’t get to the trailhead until late afternoon today, there were quite a few people on the trail. Parking is pretty limited at the actual trailhead, don’t park along the street, I saw lots of cars with tickets. There is another lower parking lot a few streets down, but I didn’t see it until I left. Beginning of the trail is fairly easy. The first stream crossing was where we ran into a lot of rock climbers as well as other hikers trying to decide if they wanted to continue on or not. Be prepared, there’s no avoiding crossing water right now. I didn’t wear water shoes nor did I pack extra shoes and socks, so I didn’t make it all the way to the meadow as eventually my feet got cold and numb. However, the trail is challenging and fun. My dog had a blast. Will definitely do this again, but with better shoes next time. "
22,2019-05-12,['hiking'],When we got there there were very few people but on our way down it was crowded. It was steep in some places and part of the trail was underwater.
23,2019-04-23,"['hiking', 'washed out']",
24,2019-04-20,['hiking'],"We only went about a mile in this time, but it was a good start to our hiking season! Lots of water coming down the stream, very pretty."
25,2019-01-26,['hiking'],"Great trail, pretty steep in some areas. Not crowded on a Saturday at 2 pm. No sun 3/4 of the way but sunny at the top. I recommend Yaktrax, but you could probably do it without."
26,2019-01-26,[''],Great winter hike with the pups. the snow is packed so spikes work great and snowshoes were not needed. the lookout at the top is amazing.
27,2019-01-13,['hiking'],"Fun Snowshoe! A bit of a grind / slog uphill, but well worth it! 

I want to come back and see if anyone else has helped pack down the trail in the upper canyon. 

:-)"
28,2018-12-23,[''],"Completely covered in snow and ice-definitely need spikes right now. Took me twice as long to go a mile than usual, and as I was losing daylight I had to abort the mission.  I'll definitely be returning to finish. Completely gorgeous Winter Wonderland right now."
29,2018-10-29,[''],"Went on a Sunday, late October. Many climbers and hikers. Made it to overlook and returned before dark. Lovely hike."
30,2018-10-28,['hiking'],"I absolutely love the beauty of this hike! I went in mid October and the leaves were stunning. I didn't make it to the top on account of the time, but plan on it very soon."
31,2018-10-23,['hiking'],"Pretty sure couple of the ratings on here didn’t go to top. Hiking into the canyon for first mile is a trail, not a hike. :) 

However, the next 1 1/2 miles are super steep. Bring at least 70 ounces water if in summer. Also in spring and summer this is SUPER overgrown at top. More overgrown than most hunting trails I go on. This is way better in fall just FYI."
32,2018-10-12,['hiking'],Amazing
33,2018-09-16,['hiking'],"Great hike. Started early morning, we were in the shade mostly the entire way. Dog loved it! About halfway into the hike it’s extremely steep and rocky, multiple ways to go up, not a specific trail outlined but we figured out which way to go. Excellent view at the top, worth it!"
34,2018-07-29,[''],Beautiful views with shaded climbing and a nice little river. More difficult coming down as there is a lot of loose gravel.
35,2018-07-29,[''],"Good but hard hike to the top,nice view from the top"
36,2018-07-22,['hiking'],"rockclimbing might be the main reason to use this trail. shaded in the middle, at the start and overlook isn't very shaded. there are too many cut offs it's hard to follow the actual trail."
37,2018-07-20,['hiking'],Hard and isn’t pretty.
38,2018-07-08,[''],"It says it’s hard, but I feel like it’s pretty easy! I’ve done it twice now the second time I saw a rattlesnake right along the entrance. I turned back because snakes are obviously scary. But the hike is a good combo of incline and flat areas. It’s shaded and clean!"
39,2018-06-26,[''],The lower canyon to the valley overlook is great. I do not recommend continuing on to the upper meadows right now. Way overgrown. Was wearing shorts and my legs definitely took a beating. Needs some trail work!  Plenty of water for dogs right now on the lower parts.
40,2018-06-23,['hiking'],"directions: No signs apart from the first one at the bottom....once you pass the water tank, go left/down to shady direction, do not go right up the mountain to follow the actual trail

snakes: it says to keep dogs on leashes but no one does. Id highly recommend using one because my dog got snapped at by a rattlesnake when i let him go free at the steep part past the rock climbers and waterfall. no bite, but shouldnt have done that."
41,2018-06-13,[''],Beautiful !
42,2018-06-03,[''],My husband proposed to me here 18 years ago! It's our favorite canyon!
43,2018-05-29,[''],"High traffic, trails are overused and confusing to stay on. Also... covered in graffiti. :-(("
44,2018-05-28,[''],"Beautiful stream that follows the trail. leads to one of, if not, the most beautiful views of the valley. just incredible."
45,2018-05-26,[''],"great trail. the lower canyon is fantastic and currently filled with little pools. the stream is flowing pretty solid. been to the Outlook like 10 times this year and today was the first time I saw any rattle snakes. two were past the overlook. one was on the trail after the second 'bridge' after the steep part. 

I see tons of rock climbing here.

also the trail doesn't end at the overlook. you can follow it up to the forest and the Ridgeline. my pup and I saw three deer bounding across the forest on our last trip."
46,2018-05-19,['hiking'],"Today, the trail was gorgeous and cool at around 7:00 am. I have never hiked this trail and would recommend shoes with good soles as well as trekking poles, because it can get slippery and you'll be crossing streams or walking in/and along side them to remain on the trail. I actually lost the trail and decided to head back so that I can try this again tomorrow and be better prepared with different shoes and my poles. Hopefully I can concentrate more on the trail and less on not slipping on the loose gravel. I want to make it to the top!"
47,2018-05-16,[''],Great hike!
48,2018-05-16,['hiking'],Very strenuous but amazing variety of scenery and a wonderful view at the top.
49,2018-04-29,[''],"Good steep hike, close to valley."
50,2018-04-28,['hiking'],very very steep. the entire time. and here we parts that see hard to tell where the trail is because of the river. you have to walk in the river at times too.
51,2018-04-27,['hiking'],"5 stars for difficulty, scenery, and diversity. There was a bit of everything, forested area, gorgeous giant boulders, waterfalls, river, overlook. Beautiful hike but very steep and rocky the entire way up. Made it very difficult and dangerous coming down. You also hike in water for a lot of this hike, literally in the river through the rocks is the only way through, so bring appropriate shoes that won’t slip. The hike is 2 miles up, 2 miles down. The first mile was really fun with diverse scenery. That one mile though felt like 2 or 3 because it’s steep and rocky, but at least it’s shaded the entire way. The second mile was brutal! I was with my 9 year old son and we didn’t finish. We got to the top, the switchbacks and almost made it to the overlook, it was a pretty view. But that last mile is not as fun, it’s just steep and rocky. Another thing I will say is that this trail is not marked at all and it’s very easy to get confused and take a different way. I had my recording on and was able to refer to the map from this app which helped me a lot. Beautiful but there’s a reason it’s marked as “hard”."
52,2018-04-22,[''],"Fun, challenging hike!
There was a little snow towards the top, but the weather was great this morning. It took my group just under three hours to go up and back."
53,2018-04-22,['hiking'],Went to the top today and didn’t run into snow and the mud wasn’t bad either.
54,2018-01-04,['hiking'],Super ICY!! Be careful. Pup loved it.. can't wait to go during the warmer months.
55,2017-12-30,['hiking'],"About 5 min into my hike I stepped in dog poo. I was being extremely vigilant about where I stepped because I could see little black bags and piles of poo scattered about the trail. Still, I continued until the kids begged to leave. We turned around and left and lo and behold, I stepped in yet another pile of poo before making it back to the car. So gross."
56,2017-12-20,['hiking'],I really enjoyed this hike. It would be a great shady hike to do during the summer.
57,2017-11-13,['hiking'],
58,2017-10-27,['hiking'],"Nice hike, great trail for the first mile then it gets tricky lots and lots and lots of rocks , so many rocks omg . But thats just a small section once you get past the rocks the trail is great"
59,2017-10-21,['hiking'],"I just discovered this canyon two days ago and hit it again Saturday morning. Absolute favorite hike since I can take my dog with me on a strenuous hike. The first time we stopped at the rock outcroppings for the view of the valley. But Saturday I went for the upper meadow... and never found it! A bit after the rock outcropping, the trail turns into bush whacking... following it up the ridge only gets extremely difficult but possible for the determined. Does anyone know where the trail to the upper meadow is?"
60,2017-10-16,[''],really cool shady hike with some granite monolyths and places to climb. steep with a nice payoff view.
61,2017-10-16,['bird watching'],This has been one of my favorite trails for many years. It gets tougher towards the top but it's well worth the effort you put into it. ❤️
62,2017-10-14,['hiking'],Epic hike! So tough at some points going up but so worth it. Didn’t encounter anyone near the top half of the hike and we were stepping on fresh snow. My pup loved it too!
63,2017-10-14,[''],"Very good but tired, please take some beers with you"
64,2017-10-11,['hiking'],Great hike with amazing views. My pup loves it too!
65,2017-09-04,['hiking'],Second time on this hike and it's a steep but rewarding trail. This time we hiked above the upper meadow to see what was there
66,2017-09-04,[''],"Love this hike! After the switch back if you follow the actual trail to the right and keep heading east up the mountain it gets super thick with over growth and leads to a overlook that isn't much of an overlook. If you stay left, it gets pretty hot and not covered but the view is much better. And makes the trail shorter hahaha that thing is long and steep af"
67,2017-08-01,['hiking'],"Did it on the 25th of July, ran into maybe half dozen people actually hiking.  There were probably a dozen climbers but they were pretty much in one area.  I'm out of shape and it kicked my tail.  I have an 18 month old lab and he was also pretty bushed by the end. It was beautiful and so peaceful I'm excited to do it in the fall."
68,2017-07-29,['hiking'],"My wife, mother-in-law, and dog took off from the trailhead around 8AM. There are only a few parking spots right at the start, so get here early to get a spot close to the trailhead. We saw about 5 people on the way up and about 12 people on the way down. Most had dogs (off leash). Very steep for most of the way up but it wasn't too strenuous. I would rate it as moderate. Had it at 5.0 miles exactly."
69,2017-07-26,['hiking'],"Nice hike, shaded most of the way. Went up on Sunday and didn't see many people past where the rock climbers were. Loved that we were able to take our super crazy high energy 10 month old GSP pup; she was pretty tuckered by the end, which is RARE. Challenging hike if you're out of shape like me, but if you hike on a regular basis, it's probably more moderate. It's uphill almost the entire way there, but the most difficult part was coming downhill on the loose dirt and gravel. I ate it a few times. Went up in my trail runners which have really good traction & they were sufficient, not sure any type of shoe would help from sliding down dirt. I would imagine chacos and similar sandals would be a pain with getting pebbles in them. We made it to about the 2 mile mark (because it was hot & I'm out of shape & got a little hangry) on the alltrails map, but the garmin watch indicates we did 5.1 miles out & back starting at the parking area with a stop by the lookout point... not sure which is more accurate for mileage."
70,2017-07-24,[''],"The meadow is more of a small rock slide, with some serious up-hill bush whacking towards the end. All in all it was very pretty and an enjoyable experience but nothing particularly exciting"
71,2017-07-15,[''],Really great trail. Good shaded path and I love the stream. We only went about a mile up because we had our little 10 week old boxer baby and she got tired. We'll be back and get through the whole home soon!
72,2017-07-13,['hiking'],"I love this canyon. Love that its not too crowded (I never tell anyone about it unless they have dogs, and then I feel like its my duty to share the wealth), I love the stream running through the middle- its great for my dog to keep hydrated as we hike, I love how its shaded throughout the day, and all of the little waterfalls are amazing. Its not too strenuous, there is one section after the first little waterfall that is pretty slippery and steep, and then another steep hill past the 3rd waterfall, but its so green and lush you don't even care. LOVE THIS HIKE."
73,2017-06-29,['hiking'],"I had to cut my hike short due to improper footwear. Some parts of the hike are very steep so I recommend hiking boots with ankle support. I really loved seeing the rock climbers in the canyon on the way up and down. The trail is secluded in trees and canyon rocks the entire time, the river running through is beautiful, and I love that I can bring my dog!"
74,2017-06-27,[''],"I loved that this trail goes right next to the rock climbing areas, it was fun to see that action. It's a though hike at times, but definitely had some pretty areas!"
75,2017-06-24,[''],"Really enjoyed this trail, though we couldn't get past about 2mi in, as it wasn't blazed/was impassable. Still a really enjoyable, challenging hike with incredibly rewarding views at the top!"
76,2017-06-18,[''],"Enjoyable hike, just not a top 10 along the Wasatch front.   Maybe I'm not seeing the beauty of it."
77,2017-06-14,['hiking'],"Ferguson Canyon is gorgeous, especially the views at the beginning and about halfway through. I only went halfway in because the trail was so steep and poorly maintained that there was no way I could finish it without trekking poles. You have to dodge quite a few fallen trees and wade through the creek a lot."
78,2017-06-14,['trail running'],Parts are very runnable
79,2017-06-11,[''],It is awesome
80,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"Made it to the saddle between Ferguson Peak and Storm Mtn with the help of a seasoned hiker I met at the trail head. He was 68 years old (twice my age) and took me to school. Super impressed with his non-stop approach all the way to the top. Took exactly 3 hrs and a steady pace. Some of the steeper sections will challenge your calves for sure. Wish I could have made it up to Ferguson peak or even out to Storm, but I ran out of time. Cold and windy at the top but amazing views down Stairs Gulch and over into BCC. I will be back with intentions of hitting the Twins."
81,2017-06-09,['hiking'],Rocky trail. Fun but a bit of an incline. Crosses the river a couple times
82,2017-06-08,['trail running'],"Pretty rocky for trail running, but it made it really challenging and technical so it was fun"
83,2017-06-06,['hiking'],"Great Hike! The trail has beautiful lush greenery, is right along a roaring spring and has a waterfall to top it all off! Partially shaded, so a great hike when it's super hot outside.(today was 95°) It's a pretty vertical incline when you get close to the top so I suggest wearing proper hiking boots. All in all, a must see!"
84,2017-06-04,[''],"Beautiful views from bottom to top!!! The trail? Not terribly obvious in some areas along the way; the higher up you hike the trail all but disappears. My hike was 4.5 miles out and back... and I went as far as the trail led me. 
In several spots the trail is loose dirt, gravel and sandstone style material- even with good traction hiking boots I nearly fell a couple of times."
85,2017-05-26,['hiking'],This hike was wonderful. Only went up about 30-40 minutes but it was beautiful.
86,2017-05-25,['hiking'],Gorgeous
87,2017-05-13,[''],"Only went up about .75 miles this time as the water made the trail impassable with the kiddos. Pretty spring blossoms along the way and very green right now. Sadly someone named ""Flower Child"" has decided to spray paint numerous rocks. I'm pretty bummed about that."
88,2017-05-07,['hiking'],"Amazing hike!  Steep and difficult, but worth it.  It was dry for a little ways past the lookout point (about half way) then we hiked in snow the rest of the way to the top.  I'm glad I wore good traction shoes, but our feet got wet a bit on the way up but very wet on the way down as we slipped and slid through the steep snow-covered slopes.  Would have needed winter boots to avoid wet feet, but the snow was a lot nicer on our knees than the hard trail.

The views were amazing and the Upper meadows very quiet and beautiful.  We hiked up to the ridge so we could see into Big Cottonwood Canyon.  

There is so much water and scrambling over rocks and streams, beautiful waterfalls, and lots of shade for the first half, then shade off and on the rest of the way up.  Beautiful, but sparse wild flowers, and I loved the rainbow-colored rocks which were everywhere on the upper half of the hike.

I want to do this one again when the snow is gone. 

We started at 6:30am and were in the shadow of the mountain most of the way up.  Perfect temperatures!"
89,2017-05-06,[''],"Don't waste your time. The first 0.5-0.75 mile is nice, but after that it's a very poor maintained, hard to follow, very slippery, not so scenic trail."
90,2017-04-06,[''],Best time to go on this hike is in the spring when the water level is high. Love this hike and easy to get to.
91,2017-02-28,['hiking'],"Finally hiked past the rock climbers and made it to some beautiful moss covered waterfalls and on to the lookout. I think the snow made it slightly easier as it leveled out some of the trail. Glad I packed my yaktrax, even though the bottom was dry and rocky, once we made it past the waterfall, the rest of the trail was snow packed and slippery. Well worth it, the entire trail is beautiful with running water, awesome rocks, lots of plants (even in February, the ferns were green along the water), and the lookout was pretty amazing. Fun hike with the pup!"
92,2017-02-23,[''],love this place such a good hike!!
93,2017-02-07,['hiking'],Cool hike and very pretty.
94,2016-11-14,['hiking'],"Ferguson is one of my absolute favorite hikes in Salt Lake City. It's a longer hike and harder then anything in Millcreek. The whole hike is beautiful, little creeks, rock climbers, dogs are welcome and overall its pretty shaded. It's perfect. If you plan to go up to watch the sunset make sure to bring a flashlight for the way down."
95,2016-10-16,['hiking'],"Today I only hiked up the first 1/2 mile or so to the rocks with my kids to play.  

It's strange reading the reviews - everything from ""this is a great short hike"" (true if you only do a great short hike) to ""great moderate to hard hike to the lookout"" (True) to ""this is an awful 10 mile hike"" (I have taken this route to the top of twin peaks and beyond, and I can't think of any way to go 10 miles while staying in this canyon) to ""The canoeing was awesome"" (a joke I guess?).

This trail is on the steep side, but footing is usually good.  I would disagree with the ""lightly trafficked""  but obviously the farther you go the lighter the traffic.  The lower canyon is really pretty and fun for playing on rocks.  Lots to explore.  That is still true higher up, but the going gets progressively more difficult.  Still, I would rate it as moderate up to the lookout.  I found the trail still pretty evident above that point, and still with steep but reasonable slopes up into the meadows.  The trail slowly fades as you climb, and climbing Storm Mountain is difficult with decent reoute finding skills required.  Most people won't ever worry about going that far.  Overall, lovely canyon with really cool rock formations and a nice little creek."
96,2016-10-02,['hiking'],"Nice hike. Shaded for most of the way until you reach the overlook. Very nice views from there. After the overlook you can keep going up, if you're up for it. We went about half way to what my buddy calls the ""rock garden"". VERY overgrown. I'd recommend pants. Poles were a big help too.

This hike is nice and varied with some rocky sections (in the canyon) and some flat inclines (once out of the canyon). Be careful on the 2 sections with loose gravel near the river."
97,2016-09-29,['hiking'],"Been on this hike twice. The first time, we got lost and wounded up on a super sketchy rocky incline that we couldn't get over. We had to throw in the towel because it got dark and the sun set before we made it all the way back down.

The second time, we had a friend that showed us a hidden side path that we literally had to CLIMB up to get to. The climb itself was pretty steep and my big Labrador needed my help at one point to get all the way up. But nonetheless, the view from that lookout point was beautiful.

I'm not sure what the end of this trailhead actually looks like. But maybe a third time in the future will be a charm. This also looks like a good spot for rock climbers. We passed a wall where we saw some people roping up."
98,2016-09-17,[''],Beautiful. Close to home.
99,2016-08-14,['hiking'],"Nice trail, some steep spots.  There were lots of people camped out rock climbing.  Lots of dogs off leash."
100,2016-08-13,['hiking'],"That was the worst hiking experience I have had. If you try to follow the ""6"" mile trail it's really closer to 10! It's overgrown, we somehow ended up not exactly on the trail at the end but showed we were at the end of the trail and it led to nothing of note, after all that work. We ran out of water with about 3-4 miles left. I wish they would update it to show it ends at the lookout point because really it does. The rest is like a difficult random side trail with no point. I think the good rating must be based off the lookout because there is no way hiking to what we went to would get s good rating. If they don't do that it sure would be nice if the distance was accurate. That was the worst!"
101,2016-08-11,[''],Great hike in the spring due to all the run off! Tons of water and shade for you and your dogs to cool off in! Take that extra time to go past the halfway point lookout you won't regret it!
102,2016-08-07,[''],the overlook that is after the steep trail and the switchback that everyone stops at is only the halfway point. but beyond that are some gnarly switchbacks that just seem like game trials and overgrown since no one goes past the overlook. At the top of the trail you could practically see Blanche
103,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"Hiked this in late June. Great steep hike that is difficult and has some confusing points along the way. This is a great dog friendly hike with water and shade. There are some lose dirt slopes so be ready to
slide a little on the way down. Towards the end the trail veers away from the water ( our dog was a little disappointed) for a spectacular view."
104,2016-06-30,['hiking'],"Did this one with my 14-year-old daughter today, and it's a memory we will treasure forever. We pulled it off in flip-flops, although that wasn't the ideal footwear choice. If you're going to put the time into going up through the the canyon, you should really tough it out through the steep, crumbly bits to get to the views of the canyon and SLC from the top. We were surprised to see so many hikers who didn't go beyond the wooded stretch that runs alongside the brook. Views from the top were awesome! At around 2 miles (as others have said) there was a little offshoot that led back west and out to a cool vista-point rock; from there we went back to the main trail that went east along the top of the canyon. We turned around and headed back instead of going to the meadows or whatever is at the end. At about 4 miles round-trip we took about 4 hours, but we stopped a lot for photos and talking to people.
Rocks, lizards, dragonflies, butterflies, waterfalls, epic views. Good times.
We're from California. All the locals we talked to along the way were super friendly. Recommended"
105,2016-06-28,['hiking'],"Not a bad trail but horrible hikers - portable radios blasting and more dog poop than any trail I've been on this year.
If you can't be courteous and responsible, please stay home."
106,2016-06-26,['hiking'],It was awesome. Once we got into the shady green areas my Dogs had a blast jumping boulders and the lake. We didn't make it too far as my older dog struggles with steep inclines. But they had so much fun. Because my older dog struggled we probably will go towards easier hikes with him. But my other two adored it. Also the trails can get confusing as there are many different branches off the original trail.
107,2016-06-24,['hiking'],This was a beautiful hike. Lots of scenery along the way.
108,2016-06-23,['hiking'],Loved it! Perfect #humpdayhike after work. Loved cooling off in the little stream. Lots of places to put up the hammock and relax.
109,2016-06-20,[''],"Great, pups loved it"
110,2016-06-11,['hiking'],This hike is a great and my favorite in the early spring when there is still a lot of snow at higher elevations. The stream is nice for the dogs. There is a very steep section where watching your footing is key but you are rewarded with an alright view down into the valley. -Heather @ www.mylifestyletoyours.com
111,2016-06-04,[''],Great trail for dogs and peace.  covered almost entire way
112,2016-06-03,['hiking'],"Very worthwhile hike. Lots of cooling river crossings, plenty of places to hitch a hammock if that's your thing, plenty of places to rock climb if that's your thing. Several mini little waterfalls. After about the first mile and a half or so, it gets really steep and somewhat sandy, so if you're as out of shape as I am, you'll feel it. After probably two miles up it spits you out on a ridge and this large rock where you can get a cool view of the valley."
113,2016-05-28,['hiking'],"Awesome little hike. But to call it ""moderate"" is pretty ridiculous. I'd say more hard.. There's spot that are straight up hill with loose gravel. But it's a awesome hike. Rocks on both sides with a river running up the middle. My Lab puppy loved it!"
114,2016-05-22,['hiking'],is a beautiful place! I like the walking all at the edge  of the river.
115,2016-05-20,[''],"Beautiful trail!! Was a little tough but still enjoyable for us and our dog!!! Lots of water, butterflies and even some bugs this time of year! I love it!"
116,2016-05-19,['hiking'],"Loved it!!!! Beautiful views of the whole valley on the way up, easy to follow trails, water all along the way, lots of shade. What more could you want! Beautiful wild flowers all around the hills? You got it! We only went about 3/4 of a mile up until you had to cross a stream and then turned back but we were hiking with young kids. Don't let the moderate rating scare you away. We hiked with a 4 year old and an infant in a carrier and they did great."
117,2016-05-18,[''],This hike was awesome until I broke through the clearing about 3.5 miles up. I lost the trail and had to turn around.
118,2016-05-18,['hiking'],Fun and wet! Dogs loved it!
119,2016-05-16,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes. It has a little bit of everything and is very rewarding. 

Be careful where you park. We got a parking ticket "
120,2016-04-24,['hiking'],"Gorgeous trail. Be ready to walk through the stream a bit, but the weather up there right now is perfect. Make sure you park in the designated spots, though, the old guy who lives across the street will call the cops and have you ticketed if you don't."
121,2016-04-20,['hiking'],"My favorite hike, it's very easy but get steep"
122,2016-04-18,[''],Great trail for a short hike and lots of water for dogs in the early season
123,2016-04-11,['hiking'],"Not an Easy hike as indicated!!!
A lot of 20% incline/decline. Make sure you wear proper footwear and bring a light day pack. Especially if you plan to go all the way. 
I prefer this hike over Bells Canyon. It's more challenging and less traveled. Plus is cooler with the cottonwood creek and more gorgeous!"
124,2016-04-11,[''],It's perfect for families short enough for kids
125,2016-04-10,[''],"Best hike ever, bring lots of water it's rough!"
126,2016-04-06,[''],The waterfall at the top is worth the trek.
127,2016-04-03,[''],"Fun little trail, very few crowds."
128,2016-03-24,['hiking'],My 7 year old had a lot of fun and so did Daddy & Mom.  Small river but fun to explore where it started from!
129,2016-03-23,[''],"This is a short hike, amazing view and you go all the way to the cave, it was covered with snow but that was not a problem at all, my only problem is the parking lot is always crowded on the weekend I had to drive way"
130,2016-03-21,[''],Short hike. Climbing routes are pretty legit though.
131,2016-03-10,['hiking'],"There is a bit of snow right now, just a tad slippery and muddy. Great little short hike after work."
132,2016-02-29,['hiking'],"It was a challenge hiking up the ice, but it was worth every second."
133,2016-01-10,['hiking'],One of the most beautiful hikes in the snow! Did this hike with bear claws no snow shoeing necessary.  Actually felt steeper in the summer with no snow.
134,2016-01-09,['hiking'],"one of my favorite hikes, many awesome views from the tops of the cliffs. Great summer hike, lots of shade.
Ive hiked this canyon many times and have had a different view everytime, free climbing up the different cliffs."
135,2015-12-08,['hiking'],Hiked the trail all the way to the upper meadow a couple of years ago. Great hike
136,2015-11-09,['hiking'],"Great trail! I tried going up the left side of the creek, but the right side is much easier. Great lookout point. Hopefully one day I can make it to the upper meadow."
137,2015-10-19,['hiking'],Great scenery and atmosphere for how easily accessible it is. Was very slippery because of some rain and all of the fallen leaves and hard to follow where the trail actually went. Saw a bunch of climbers and dogs along the way. At the top you have to scramble up the rocks to actually get a full view. This was definitely hard but doable; the way down we just slid down the rocks. Would recommend this more on a dry summer day versus spring/fall.
138,2015-10-15,['paddle sports'],The canoeing was awesome!!! So many Rapids and rocks.
139,2015-10-14,['hiking'],"The trail is very rocky and has a lot of loose dirt on it. The elevation gains make it more than an easy. However, the view is worth the difficulty."
140,2015-08-05,['hiking'],"More than an easy-medium hike. Some parts were all massive rocks other parts, mad incline. Lots of rock climbers and tons of bugs! Lovely view."
141,2015-07-27,['hiking'],"Pros: Dog friendly. Kid friendly for first 1.5 miles. Shady! Amazing canyon walls, caves and baby waterfalls. Close to Salt Lake.
Cons: Crowded. A bit muddy in the spring and the trail can be rocky/difficult to traverse in places. 
Summary: Worth fighting the crowds to cool off with great views."
142,2015-07-18,['cross country skiing'],"This was a great hike with lots of different terrain. I took my three little kids and they did well. It definitely has some steep parts and lots of rocks to maneuver through but the kids loved it. Good hiking shoes is a must! It was shady most the time, we didn't make it to the top because the rocks were getting harder to climb and get through but it was great scenery the entire time"
143,2015-07-18,['hiking'],"Whomever decided this is an easy trail was mistaken, especially if you go all the way to the top. Beautiful trail, but isn't exactly a clear path at times. My kids (12 & 10) enjoyed it and only had a hard time on the really steep parts - going up & back down. Great for dogs! My Frenchie had a blast with the creek to play in."
144,2015-07-17,['hiking'],"I'm just getting back into the hiking game and decided to try this hike after work with my dog. It was overall a really great trail! Some people have commented it was easy ... I did not find it easy - moderate is a very accurate rating in my opinion. It wasn't super difficult but it has a very steady incline, lots of natural steps / rocks and takes a significant amount of energy. I personally do think it's a great trail close to SLC for newbies or people trying to get back into hiking / get into shape. 

The trail follows a little stream which was great - my dog loved drinking from the water and playing in the little springs on the way up. I really loved how low traffic it was (on a Thursday around 6pm) and it is almost completely shaded which is so great for these hotter summer days. We got to the very rocky part just past the climbers when we decided to turn around. My Great Dane isn't a nimble little lab and he was struggling to get his awkward 170lb self around all of the rocky terrain. I decided to turn around rather than risk it. On the way out I was impressed with the gorgeous city views - especially if you hit it at sunset. 

I will definitely return here. It makes for an awesome, shorter after-work hike or a dog trip even if you don't go the whole way. I hope to return and check out what's further up the trail!"
145,2015-07-11,[''],"Beautiful, easy hike. Lots of great places to climb. Great for dogs - a little too easy for my dog ;) - or kids."
146,2015-07-04,['hiking'],"Excellent hike, but you have to understand this is definitely considered a strenuous hike, especially if you go beyond the climbing spot and the waterfall all the way to the overlook. It's definitely worth the trip. I'm a regular hiker and biker, and this hike took a significant amount of energy, and coming down is just as challenging as going up. Extremely rocky terrain as you climb up, with some very steep inclines as you go. Those steep inclines become steep declines as you come down, and some of it can be slippery. I would not categorize as dangerous, but you just have to take it slow and be careful."
147,2015-07-02,['cross country skiing'],"This was a beautiful hike. Went July 1st in the evening. My fiancé and I are very novice hikers, and we picked this one because the description said it allowed dogs and was rated as Easy. It wasn't easy for us, but it was still very nice and cool with lots of tree cover and beautiful rocks. The hard part was the constant uphill rocky trail, but it was ok. The orange from the sunset trickled in through the trees onto the rocks and it made the whole hike. There's a stream and a small spring a little ways up. We didn't make it up to the waterfall, but overall it was a beautiful hike. My Australian Shepherd is part mountain goat, I discovered."
148,2015-06-27,['hiking'],Always an enjoyable hike. The beginning doesn't have much shade but once you get into the canyon itself you are almost always covered. Perfect for a hot day.
149,2015-06-22,['walking'],"This hike is perfect for hot days as it is shaded the majority of the way. Parking in the neighborhood at the hike entrance is highly restricted and the street is patrolled by a police car often. So make sure you park within the few designated spots or down the streets where there are no parking prohibited signs. There are two waterfall areas that are at the 3.2 mile round trip mark. You can hike beyond the second waterfall to an overlook but it is reportedly an additional 3 miles. We didn't go to the overlook this time but will return to do it soon. Just make sure to plan for more time and distance to reach the overlook. Point of confusion - when you get to the second waterfall area by a little cave like rock area, the trail continues to the right - you have to cross the water stream. The most helpful tip to give for this hike is that you need good hiking shoes or gripping sneakers as there are many stretches that are loose gravel which making climbing and descending challenging. A walking stick or poles are also helpful. Next time we go to reach the outlook we will bring walking poles!!"
150,2015-06-15,['hiking'],"Really enjoyed the shade of this hike as well as the water most of the way up. plenty of friendly dogs along the way. Rock climbers were having a great time. such pretty landscape.  was steep in some places, we should have brought our hiking poles. did not make it to the top as someone coming back down reported two rattle snaked close to trail not far ahead from us on the steep part. we have a very curious puppy so decided not to tempt fate and turn around. we hiked for under an hour at a leisure pace before turning around. will go back. parking is limited."
151,2015-06-13,[''],Definitely not a hike for flip flops! Steep areas and not so kid friendly but worth the view! Great for those who are into rock climbing.
152,2015-06-11,['hiking'],"I brought my dog in early spring. It was beautiful. Fairly easy. We crossed the water a few times and turned back, it was getting pretty deep. I'm sure I didn't make it to the end. I would love to try again in the summer when the water is lower."
153,2015-05-29,[''],So much to explore ! My favorite canyon.
154,2015-05-28,['hiking'],Great views all along the way. Has some small creek crossings and our feet got a little wet. Dog friendly hike. Has some steep hiking as well.
155,2015-05-27,['hiking'],"Absolutely gorgeous, it follows right along the river with several waterfalls along the way."
156,2015-05-27,[''],There was a variety in the landscape and moderately challenging terrain. The final view is breathtaking!!!!
157,2015-05-17,['hiking'],"Did this hike yesterday for the first time in the pouring rain! It was awesome, but I am not sure I made it to the end of the trail. About 50 minutes in I ended up away from the river on a bunch of switch backs that lead up the mountain to a great view of Salt Lake City below. I continued up the switch back trail until it came to an end. 

Was this the true end??"
158,2015-05-05,['hiking'],Another great day hiking Ferguson Canyon-especially with my son Adam. Nothing better!
159,2015-04-25,['hiking'],"04/23/2015 | 4:30-7:15 pm
A healthy variety of terrain. As has been said previously, their are some steep inclines that are mostly sandy/gravely, which makes the descent a bit of a strain. At moments, the trail can be a bit nebulous, but not too difficult to find. There are a few stream crossings, all of which have ample stones or trees that make the crossings pretty easy. 

That said, this hike is full of photo ops. Beautiful moss covered rocks, a drinkable spring, small waterfalls, towering rock formations (ideal for bouldering/climbing) and canyon walls, and delicious vistas. Yeah, I said, ""delicious"". 

Suffice to say, once you've experienced this hike, you'll want to return with friends in tow."
160,2015-03-29,[''],Hiked this trail to Storm Mountain 3/28/15. Started out easy following a creek but once in the scrub oak it was pretty much make your own trail. There is not a designated trail that I could find other than animal trails. Finishing at Storm Mountain was very difficult. After being torn up by scrub oak I dont think I will attempt it again.
161,2014-08-26,['rock climbing'],Hiked it and rocked climbed this area a few times. Not my favorite place in the wasatch front. I would skip over this canyon and head straight to Little or Big Cottonwood for you next adventure.
162,2014-08-10,['hiking'],"Absolutely SHOCKED(!!!!!) no one has reviewed this.  My rock climbing buddies have been raving about this spot for years, -years-, not being a rock climber I hadn't gotten to it.   Finally explored it this year with my bf who comes from an outdoorsy family (who had also not done it) it's a surprisingly consistent climb but by all means nothing too difficult. Very mellow and fun loving crowd.  The riparian nature, and best of all the PHENOMENAL boulders just make this an amazingly spectacular hike. The first little bit follows a creek, then diverts off amongst monumental granite then cares it's way up to the foremost lower out cropping on the south side of big cottonwood. Not a particular destination hike, but worth it, in and of itself."
163,2014-07-30,[''],"Great shady hike in mid summer.  Give the climbers their space.  Like a lot of other places in Utah, Ferguson is very unique. Tight canyon with cliffs on both sides, as narrow as 75 feet in places. I would call it moderate.  The top is a bit harder but few people go that far."
164,2014-07-15,[''],"The water and the rocks make this trail very pretty. The plants are nice, but not quite as stunning as they are in places like Millcreek. 
There are parts that are quite steep. I definitely wouldn't take my mom on this hike. But, I did take my dog. She loved it. We went on a Saturday and there were so few people that I was comfortable letting her off-leash. It is quite steep. She enjoyed the shade and the water as well as chasing snakes."
165,2014-06-28,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful and demanding hike with great view of Salt Lake City. The trail is very rocky in places, very good in other, and very overgrown in the upper canyon. The upper meadow at the head of the canyon and just below Storm Mountain and several other mountains was full of mint smelling plants. When the wildflowers are in bloom it should be quite amazing to see."
166,2014-06-21,['hiking'],"This hike is a little more challenging than moderate.  We hiked the Silver Lake and the Living Room trails and felt they were a little easier.  This one wasn't terribly bad though, just a little more difficult than the other two.  Hiking mostly under the canopy of trees through a dry creek bed kept us cool.  There are a few pretty, small, waterfalls on the way up.  When you get nearer the top it kind of seems like you're going nowhere and then you come out of the canopy and a little further on you see a really nice view of the whole Salt Lake Valley."
167,2014-06-09,[''],Great hike and lots of coverage. A couple of spots on the trail is loose gravel and steep. These are hard to get down. Thanks to the poop bags I kept on the trail.
168,2014-06-07,['hiking'],Great hike with the dog! You stay under the canopy for a large part of the hike so it keeps you nice and cool. Go early to beat the crowds.
169,2014-04-07,['hiking'],"Beautiful canyon with rocks, caves, waterfalls,  and streams.  Dogs allowed on leashes,  but most people had dogs off leash,  so this doesn't seem like it's enforced.  Still snowy in the upper half the trail and very slippery."
170,2013-07-30,['hiking'],"Great trail with some awesome rock climbing spots. My kids loved eating all the fresh, wild raspberries along the path."
171,2013-07-16,['hiking'],Go early to beat heat & crowds. Also gets tough for small kids towards the top.
172,2013-06-27,['hiking'],I took a different path going up sooner. The track is called reverse from the top. So the track is backwards and twice the distance of the stated distance. It was very steep and more than the 81 ft. Gain it said.
173,2013-06-18,['hiking'],"Nice easy/moderate hike by the creek. The trail goes off to an overlook of SLC next to the big cottonwood canyon road.

There were lots of flowers and butterflies, and we saw 3 snakes :)"
174,2013-05-31,['hiking'],Nice little trail that's very accessible. I would agree with the other reviewers who said this trail is more on the moderate side than on the easy side. There are a couple of parts that are pretty steep and it takes some thinking to figure out how to get up. Overall it was a nice hike--very green early in the year from the stream coming down and then a nice view of the valley on the upper side.
175,2013-03-28,['hiking'],"I just hiked this trail this week. The trails are still fairly snowy, I recommend taking chains for your shoes. If you don't own any no worries, I hiked without them and was just fine. There are  a few spots that are a little slick going down but nothing to worry about."
176,2012-11-05,['hiking'],"This trail is awesome. It is always are go to hike. I recommend going between April-August.
When the water has dried up you don't get the beautiful stream and colors. Other than that this hike is awesome!!"
177,2012-09-06,['hiking'],Nice canyon with high rock walls.  It takes about 1 hour to get to a nice overlook back toward the West and the mouth of Big Cottonwood canyon. Parking is limited and recently this trail seems to be very popular.
178,2012-08-17,['hiking'],Very good hike. It was steep in places and have to pass over some areas of rocks. I will not do this trail again. It smelled so bad because people don't clean up after their dogs. Have to watch where you step!!
179,2012-06-23,['hiking'],"I haven't climbed in Ferguson yet, but I used hike it often after work for a great view of the valley and to get that ""outside"" feeling after or before a long day. It's a great hike!
 That being said I would rate it as moderate. The first time I tried it, I had no idea of how to get up and down that noticeably steep part. 
 But it makes for a glorious sunset view. 
All in all, it's convenient, never crowded (like the other canyons tend to be), beautiful, and its just enough to get the heart going a bit.
isn't that what everyone wants in a hike?
O and not great for trail running until you get to the upper- so not consistent."
180,2012-04-08,['trail running'],"Whoever rated this trail as easy is a masochist. The length is manageable, less than 2 miles up, but there're parts that are very steep.
Early in the spring there was a lot of snow on parts of the trail. At points it was very difficult to ascend because of how slick it is.
 Once you make it up the last steep climb out of the gorge, the trail flattens out a lot. Here there are excellent views of the entire valley as well as Big Cottonwood Canyon."
181,2010-05-16,['hiking'],"I've only been about half way up the canyon. Close to the bottom of the trail is a popular place for people to practice rock climbing. There are a few cool things to look at but it's been well worn in the lower area. There is a side trail that wraps around into Big Cottonwood for a nice overlook view. This hike is just that, a hike. Not a destination."
