0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],Beautiful views around every corner!!! One of our favs!!!
1,2019-09-04,['hiking'],I did this trail clockwise and was happy I did! Wall Lake was an excellent grand finale of lakes. Trail was easy-moderate.
2,2019-09-02,['hiking'],Great trail. So much fun. Kids jumped the cliffs on wall lake.  Such a beautiful hike. Highly recommend. 
3,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Absolutely a great trail, couldn’t believe how many alpine lakes there are.  It’s rated easy, but in reality it should be closer to moderate due to the amount of incline there is.  Went first week of September and absolutely no bugs at all.  You come across some shade but be prepared for a good amount of sun exposure."
4,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
5,2019-08-30,['hiking'],so this is a poorly marked trail and alltrails lost GPS on my Pixel multiple times. That lead to a labyrinth of wrong trails and loads of backtracking all day. Don't rely on this map. Go with someone that's been on this trail before.
6,2019-08-29,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes. Every corner has a new lake and beautiful scenery. The trail is very entertaining, some rocks to climb around but not annoying. Highly recommend "
7,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! Got to see a lot of lakes, and wildflowers and not too many other people considering the busyness at the trailhead! We went counter clockwork. Camped at Three divide lakes. We never found a trail from the divide lakes to twin lakes, I’m guessing there is one just didn’t find it, just went over land! At twin lakes we caught the trail to take us down to Wall lake and the trail head. Mosquitoes are pretty much gone for the year! "
8,2019-08-21,['hiking'],Love this trail. We went to Ibantik then came back and finished the loop. Everywhere you look there is a lake or pond. If you just climb up a little on the Ibantik trail you can see all the lakes from above. 
9,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"This area is gorgeous and we saw so many lakes. There are a few trailheads at the parking lot, so to go counterclockwise like most people, start at the Clyde Lake trail. We went clockwise to get most of the elevation gain over with - this makes it a firmly moderate trail. The only issue is that it's easy to lose the trail going this way, and the fork to go to Three Divide Lakes is nonexistent. I had to use the All Trails map several times to stay on route. When we did find the trail to the three lakes, several parties were camped right on the trail, which is annoying. We didn't have any trouble with bugs until dusk. It's an awe-inspiring area to explore, and I highly recommend it. Just have the All Trails map downloaded. "
10,2019-08-15,['hiking'],"Great hike! There were a lot of cars in the parking lot but we didn't see very many people on the trail. Lots of lakes along the way, which was great for my dog who loves to cool off on a hike. So many beautiful yellow and white wildflowers! We were prepared with bug spray but didn't need to use it. Didn't see any mosquitos. Not a difficult hike."
11,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"This is such a pretty trail, easy loop with little elevation gain. Great trail for backpacking overnight!"
12,2019-08-07,['hiking'],This loop was perfect for my older dog. There was plenty of shade and water along the trail for her and the grade was mellow. We enjoyed stunning views and meadows full of wildflowers. Would definitely recommend for those looking for a casual day hike loop. 
13,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","Did this in the afternoon after hiking Bald Mountain.   Made a great combo.  Peak hike and then a loop hike to some beautiful lakes.   Started this hike  about 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon.   Parking lot was very full,  but I guess everyone was at Trial Lake.   Because they were not on this trail.   Only about 6 other people at Wall Lake.   Saw maybe another 10 on the rest of the hike total.   We went opposite of the prescribed route on Alltrails. (Wall lake first)  This is a fairly easy hike.  Moderate for me today considering I did another hike before this one.   Really wished I had trunks at Wall Lake.  Almost got in anyway.  Lots of bugs, but they weren't too bad as long as we kept moving.  Plenty of camp sites along the route.   I'll come back for an overnighter.  Got some great pictures. "
14,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Nice easy hike. Lots of bugs when you stop moving, but continue walking and you’ll be fine! So many lakes to see. Not very many people. Beautiful scenery. And it didn’t even seem like 5 miles"
15,2019-07-31,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
16,2019-07-26,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']","I've done this hike several times. Great fairly fast and easy hike. My dogs loved it. If you bring dogs, watch for horses, they are common in the area and have right of way on trails. "
17,2019-07-22,['backpacking'],"Backpacking July 19-21 to hidden lake just beyond the three divides lakes. Mosquitoes were the worst I’ve ever seen from three divides down to hidden lake. Did this hike counter clockwise until the divides then down to hidden for 2 nights. Day hiked to Mount Watson, then hidden lake back to the trail head continuing counter clockwise. Friday night at sunset the fish were hitting the water like rain at Clyde lake. Hidden lake had a few jumping but nothing biting, may have had partial winter kill. Main loop trail is nice and dry for the most part but going to the 3 divides or hidden lake there’s lots of marshes and wet trail making the mosquitoes horrible. "
18,2019-07-18,['hiking'],Love this area and have hiked it plenty. Did this hike in reverse from the direction I normally go. Much easier in this direction! Bugs were out in full force- bring the bug juice!
19,2019-07-16,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Beautiful scenery, climbs aren’t super hard. Certainly more of a moderate hike, only because of distance. Liked going counter-clockwise. Bring your bug spray!"
20,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
21,2019-07-12,['hiking'],"Spectacular, gorgeous.  Lake after lake after lake, with burbling streams connecting them.  No idea why this is rated moderate, it's a stroll in the woods.  Some mud, nothing difficult.  Get there early, we arrived at 9:30 and were lucky to find a space."
22,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",A
23,2019-07-07,['hiking'],Incredible vistas. So beautiful. some snow and mud so bring boots that can get wet.
24,2019-01-29,[''],"Absolutely beautiful hike, great camping, and lots of fishing."
25,2018-11-15,[''],"Hiked at sunrise on 11/15, went counter clockwise. I would say about 85-90% of the trail was a nice snow pack and easy to walk on but there were some big snow drift spots. Didn’t have any issues with ice and slipping. Wall lake was the only lake not completely ice and snow covered. Looking forward to returning after winter."
26,2018-11-10,['hiking'],"Went last weekend to hike this trail. We started around 8:30/9:00. There was snow throughout the entire trail, but it wasn't too bad for the most part. Mid-way through the hike, there was some deeper snow and you lose the trail a little. But it's pretty easy to use All Trails app to find your way through this tiny part and get back on the trail. SO gorgeous this time of year! And the snow melted as the day went on - making the trail easier to see."
27,2018-10-08,['hiking'],"Took the dogs out for this fun hike last week. It was pretty dry out so part of the trail was really dusty but still fun. It was nice to have the variety of terrain from dirt, to wooden foot bridge crossings, to climbing rocky boulder steps. Loved having plenty of little lakes and ponds to stop at. We took the clockwise route on accident and found that it was still fun, just a little steep for the dogs at times. There were definitely no bugs out so that was a plus! Don’t forget to pay the park fee before you start exploring because we forgot and found a nice little envelope on our windshield requesting payment when we got back to the car. Oopsies!"
28,2018-10-03,['hiking'],"We went on this hike the first Monday in October. The weather was perfect (overcast with a chill to keep you from sweating). we went counterclockwise and found it was the best choice since the switchbacks were easier to go up than the loose rocks coming down. We only saw 4 other people on our hike and there were NO BUGS! we also saw some wildlife, including Mountain goats! overall this hike was really fun and pretty easy, even for my New England lungs. I definitely recommend taking a photo of the map since there is NO SERVICE and some unmarked splits in the path."
29,2018-09-25,['hiking'],"First visit in the Uinta. The landscapes are beautiful but there were TONs OF MOSQUITOES!!! Make the hike much harder than we anticipated because we could not rest around the lakes... We heard that is common in June-July and it's much better in August so we might come back later in the season next year.
Because of the elevation, I would rate this hike moderate. Also, the ""3 divide lake"" trail on the North-West of the loop is hard to find."
30,2018-09-10,[''],"beautiful, but I'm not sure this is really a loop. I went clockwise and couldn't find the intersection with the Notch Trail.  my nat geo map does not show a loop. it's missing the east west connector at the top. Nice to see the fall colors."
31,2018-09-10,['hiking'],"This trail is great, every lake has another view it is always beautiful. Absolutly not crowded. Much silenc, awesome."
32,2018-09-05,[''],Wonderful hike today! Our info said 6 miles. Perfect weather!
33,2018-09-03,['hiking'],"The views of the many lakes all along the way are beautiful. The trail is easy to follow except up to Three Lakes Divide. There isn’t a trail here and I felt bad walking on the foliage. I would have given this 5 stars if it did not include this section. Also, be prepared to pay for parking and it can pretty full. You’ll need $6 cash for one day."
34,2018-09-03,['hiking'],"Pretty busy. Sunday of Memorial weekend and got there at around 10:30am, so guess that’s to be expected on an already known busy trail. Had to park in overflow parking down the road a bit. Lots of hikes start here, and after the first bit it thinned out some. Lots of cool lakes along the way. Hiked to the last one and had a pretty peaceful lunch and tried to photograph some dragonflies. Saw some tent campers and people fishing. Overall we enjoyed the area and hope to come back for an overnight sometime."
35,2018-08-18,[''],beautiful trail.  one of my favorites!
36,2018-08-04,['hiking'],"Great hike, not too crowded, hiked pass 16 lakes. That’s cool."
37,2018-07-29,['hiking'],great hike. we hiked into Wall lake and the bushwacked toward Cliff Lake and made it a 3 mile hike. Would be a good hike for children.
38,2018-07-28,[''],I LOVED this hike. Challenging enough (I’m a bit out of shape) but not overwhelming for the length. So. Dang. Gorgeous. There were so many wildflowers. Cool rock formations. I made a wrong turn and ended up overlooking even more lakes (one of them started with an ‘N’...) off of Clyde lake. Can’t recommend enough. I want to go back when I have more time and explore that whole area. I started from the cliff lake trail head rather than wall lake and I recommend that route actually.
39,2018-07-22,[''],"Perfect trail. Some steep sections, overall great day hike."
40,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"Amazing views of lakes, mountains, meadows, and streams. Even on the 4th of July it wasn’t that busy. Beautiful trail. "
41,2018-01-21,['hiking'],Nice loop hike with great view and the potential to see mountain goats
42,2017-10-08,[''],So beautiful! Lake after lake after lake! Saw very few people. A touch of snow and mud.
43,2017-08-06,['backpacking'],Absolutely gorgeous hike. We used this trail to take our kids on their first real backpacking trip. Youngest is 5 and she did great. I docked a star because heavily trafficked is an understatement. There was a point where it felt like we were in a backcountry KOA. Super busy on the weekends and huge families with loud kids were everywhere. Not the place to go if you're seeking solitude and silence.
44,2017-07-24,['hiking'],The views were great. there isn't really a trail up to the top of the three divide lakes so we got a little lost. The parking lot was very full and you are supposed to pay for a recreation pass that is on the road prior to turning into the parking lot area.
45,2017-07-24,[''],This trail is great for all skill levels. I believe we may have actually done the 17 Lakes Loop as that is how many lakes we saw. This trail is stunning.
46,2017-07-09,['backpacking'],This is an amazing beginner trail. We chose to complete this loop for my 5 yr old son's first backpacking experience.
47,2017-07-04,['backpacking'],I did this hike strung together with a few others early spring.  I recommend taking traction aids if there is snow and the temp are cold at night.
48,2017-06-25,['backpacking'],"Did the full loop on a single night backpacking trip.  Spent the night in between the 1st and 2nd divide lakes.  Trails was off and on snow covered, especially on the northern facing slopes and between Clyde and Watson lakes.  Where there wasn't snow, their was a fair amount of mud from the melting snow.  Beautiful area, lots to see and do, but the fish were not too cooperative :-)."
49,2017-04-02,[''],Hiked this with my young adult kids who found it easy enough to spend the day making many side trips throughout the day
50,2016-09-04,['hiking'],"Great hike, lots of nice views of the lakes. Lost the trail for a while north of Wall lake but easily found it again."
51,2016-08-30,['backpacking'],Amazing trail!! Don't forget to buy a pass before parking. A family leaving gave me theirs. Dog friendly and not too busy. Would do it again!!
52,2016-08-15,['backpacking'],"Did this hike as part of the 17 Lakes Loop (not listed) and loved every second. Beautiful scenery, amazing views, lots of wildlife. We spent the night at Upper/North Twin Lake where we had the lake pretty much to ourselves, there was another camp across the lake but we never heard or seen them. I would recommend this to everyone!!"
53,2016-07-26,['hiking'],This was a fantastic hike.  We took many photos of the amazing views.
54,2016-07-17,['backpacking'],"I went backpacking Tuesday - Wednesday. is was a great trip! The trail was pretty easy and it felt like we made it to the divide lakes in a snap. it is very beautiful. In July it was perfect temperature to hike, but got cold at night. This is a great trip, but a busy one. We saw two other groups camping. when we hiked out, we ran into a group of 30 hikers, and a large youth group backpacking(it will be even worse on the weekends). The other problem is finding the trail. After you get to the trailhead, head down the trail on the left(can't remember what it is called, but it is not the sign that says the notch). after about a half mile, turn left at the cliff lake sign. When heading back, we did not do the loop, just turned around. a great trail, but busy."
55,2016-07-06,[''],"I took my 8 yr old, 6 yr old and 5 yr old to long lake and back for an overnighter July 2,3 2016. parking lot was packed at noon, and it took 1/2 hr to find a spot. It was an easy trail, well defined with a slight climb over Mt Watson at 11,500'. most of the hikers were day trippers, a lot of dogs and a couple groups with horses. The kids made it there with several breaks. There are actually several more trail spurs from the round trail shown here with many more options for exploring alternate routes. Take a map."
56,2016-04-20,['camping'],"Did this hike at night during June. It was a pleasant hike, easy to follow the trail. This would be a great hike for a first time backpacker wanting a back country experience. My group went in on a Tuesday, and fished around at the numerous lakes in the area, and returned to our camp each night. We had the place almost to ourselves until Thursday evening when a group camped 50 feet from us. upon returning to camp Friday evening, it was like a little city. campfires could be seen all around the lake. Lots of Boy Scouts it appeared. Good for them."
57,2015-08-17,['hiking'],Out looking for a good turn off point to hike up Haystack.  The Lake wasn't much further so we had to come check it out.  Had a great weekend hiking the many lakes and we did make to the top of Haystack.
58,2015-08-17,['hiking'],Great hike.
59,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"This is the perfect hike for the beginner backpacker, or for someone that really wants to get a quick taste of the Uintas, without spending days doing strenuous hikes. 
The trailhead starts at the Crystal Lake Trailhead, but you will very quickly leave this trail. You'll come upon a sign for ""Cliff Lake"", turn right here toward Cliff Lake. From here, you go through several series of flat meadows, separated by fairly steep, but very brief, climbs to gain 50-100 feet elevation. In each series, you get a new lake, new meadow, and new views. All the while, Mt. Watson is dominating the view to the West. Once you approach Clyde Lake, you'll start to drop down toward the Divide Lakes. There are 3 in total. The first is by far the most fishable, but the third (where we stayed overnight) will give you the most solitude from other backpackers. 
There are several short hikes you can do once you set up camp there. We also did a quick hike out to ""The Notch"", and several other lakes in the surrounding area. 
You'll have plenty of water at your fingertips for this one. In fact, there was a natural spring on the south side of Divide Lake 3 that you can use for clean water. Just look for the break in the meadow/grass on the south side of the lake, and follow the break up toward Mt. Watson. We all drank from it, and nobody got sick ;)"
60,2015-07-11,['camping'],Great Trail. Quite a bit of people though. So if u r looking for solitude this won't be the one for you! Rained on us also every afternoon and off and on until about 8-9 and then nonstop til about 3-4 in the morning. Overall great trail and beautiful scenery! Well worth it if u got a couple of days to go and enjoy relaxing in Gods Country!
61,2015-05-30,['hiking'],Attempted this in late May and there was still way too much snow. Snowshoes definitely required until later in the year. Really nice area though and look forward to another visit.
62,2014-09-26,['hiking'],"This trail head is a great starting point for adventure. You can literally see some of the best scenery that Uintah mountains have to offer depending how long you want to hike and how much time you have. The hikes range from short hikes to pristine lakes, to longer hikes with high peaks and mountain streams. This trailhead has been a favorite of mine for years and never dissapoints. The only downside is that traffic continues to pick up and solitude is becoming hard to find unless you are willing to go on weekdays, or the non-busy season."
63,2014-08-06,['hiking'],"Great short hike! Good fishing and Mt. Watson is really cool. You can springboard to several cool areas from this hike. Take a dog, fishing pole, and some good friends!"
64,2014-07-30,[''],"Three Divide Lakes sits at the top of a crest that separates the Provo and Weber River drainages.  There are literally more than a dozen lakes in the area and the trail passes by at least 9 of them.  Three Divide Lakes are tucked right up against the northern flank of Mt. Watson. The trail is well marked up to about Clyde Lake, then you're on your own.  From Clyde to Three Divide is not too far so it's not a big deal, just hug the side of Watson and the rest is easy.  Campsites are good and fishing is good. Enjoy!"
65,2013-08-27,['hiking'],"Incredible views to be seen here, but was VERY busy.  We passed countless large groups on the way, which detracted from my enjoyment of it.  We did a side trip down to Hidden lake, which we had all to ourselves and the fishing was much better down there.  We did another side trip above (to the NW) the twin lakes.  This was the highlight of the trip for me.  We had a breathtaking view of the twin lakes, Clyde lake, and you could even see Wall lake and star lake from up there.  The trail itself was nothing to write home about, but the views made this trip very much worth it.
Here's our track: http://alltrails.com/tracks/3454-hidden-lake-trail"
66,2013-08-13,['hiking'],"We took the trail from Crystal Lake to Marjorie Lake.  Very nice hike, pretty easy.  Some parts of the trail are smooth and sandy as opposed to rough and rocky, which is common in The Uintas. 

This trail branches out in several directions leading to different lakes.  Some of the trails aren't listed here or on the rangers' maps.  As I complete more of those paths I will update the info."
67,2013-08-12,['hiking'],Overall a good hike. Worth it for the fantastic views. If looking for more solitude avoid this trail or head all the way to Hidden lake. Trail can be tricky at times. When in doubt check both directions to make sure your on the right path.
68,2012-07-08,['hiking'],"This was a fun trail to hike! The trailhead is well marked at the parking lot and there are restrooms available. The first mile is a little steep and from there it's a lot of up and down hills mixed with a few flat areas. The last half mile to Island Lake is also a little steep. There are signs at each of the junctions pointing the way to the next lake and some have mileage on them (although I believe some of them are a little off). Unless you know which lake you're going to next you might want to bring a map. There are some additional trails which take you to different lakes in other directions. Other than that the trail is easy to follow. All of the major lakes have camping areas available, which are marked on the signs and point the general direction to them. Long Lake had very few trees close to the shore so it's more exposed. The southern part of the loop from Duck Lake to beyond Weir Lake is the most scenic part of the hike. I thought all of the major lakes were beautiful and would certainly be worthy of an overnight stay.

Overall I would rate this as moderate in difficulty. Watch out for horse manure along the trail. There are a few spots with a little running water to cross, but someone has done a nice job of making them easy to cross."
69,2010-09-13,['hiking'],"This is a nice hike that heads out along the same trail as Island Lake but ends just before the trail gets more strenuous.  Easy for most of the trail, moderate for a short portion going over the saddle between Haystack and Watson Mountains.
Very nice to take photos from the north and south ends of the lake."
70,1975-07-19,['hiking'],Hiked portion of this trail head twice this summer. Once to Island Lake completing a loop and once to Ibantik Lake. Both are very scenic
