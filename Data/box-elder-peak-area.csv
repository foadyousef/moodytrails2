I suspect it is about 2 miles more than an out-and-back and a good amount more gain.  the box elder trail is overgrown in many spots; suggest wearing long pants (i didn't and my legs are scratched up). the views are super, especially of timp, utah lake, lone peak, pfeifferhorn, red baldy.  but the peak was swarmed with flying ants and other ants that bite. very unpleasant; i stayed for only about 5 mins before they ran me off."
1,2019-09-04,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Did this today by myself. Hiked up from the north side on trail 43, starting at the Granite Creek Campground Trailhead. The trail follows the ridge and gets pretty steep. Well worth the great views from the top, particularly of the backside of Timp.

I hiked down the south side of the summit, which has a lot of loose rock, and is even steeper than the ridge that I hiked up on the north side. I followed the Box Elder Trail back to the trailhead. The entire loop is more like 12 miles, not 11 miles."
2,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"Steep trail without a lot of reward. No great views, no water, nothing really outstanding. "
3,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","What an epic hike!  Definitely not for the faint of heart, this butt burner has a climb that does not quit, a few cliff edge scrambles, and loose edges sliding into oblivion.  You’ll be rewarded by non stop scenery with a truly awesome view over Utah lake and next door neighbor Timp.

The trail winds through several creeks, some gushing and some dried to a trickle.  Trail 44 dried up after 1.2 miles, taking trail 43 down I found several on the way.  If I were to do it again I would hike clockwise, a longer uphill until a insanely steep push to summit.  I would also start earlier than 11:30 as this hike is HARD and I was in the fairly exposed midday sun 7 hours."
4,2019-08-17,['hiking'],Beautiful views from the top and lots of wildflowers.  Rated 4/5 due to more mileage than expected and soooo steep the last push to the summit-was wishing for switchbacks-but doable.
5,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"Did this with my dog today and it took a little less than 6 hours. Conditions were great only saw a few people on the trail. Great views of Timp, Utah lake,  silver lake flat and tibble reservoir!"
6,2019-08-02,['hiking'],Great trail with spectacular views. Does get steep towards the summit.
7,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'over grown']","7/26/2019: The views of this hike were amazing! The mileage is definitely more towards 12 RT. The trail steadily gains elevation up the the saddle which took 2 1/2 hours with a backpack. Once you hit the 4 way intersection and head to the peak it took 1.5 hours. The climb to the summit from the base is of the peak is STEEP but man the views from the top are totally worth it. We backpacked and camped in the meadow, bugs were bad, but not as bad as I thought. The wildflowers were beautiful, so many different kinds! This trail does NOT offer any shade. There is a small stream about 2 miles up and that is the last water source you will see so bring plenty of water. No snow or mud. We lucked out with a cloud cover for the hike that cleared at the top for us to get some pictures. 

Side note: The campers that stayed in our little spot before us left over 4 bags full of garbage. Tin cans, fruit cup garbage, candy wrappers, plastic soda and Gatorade bottles. Very disappointing. We were able to take the 4 bags worth but didn’t have more room for the rest, probably another two bags. LEAVE NO TRACE. "
8,2019-07-20,['hiking'],Great hike! It’s relatively steep pretty consistently on the way up but the the last mile or so before the summit gets VERY steep! Beautiful views and wildflowers all along the way. Loved it!
9,2019-07-13,['backpacking'],"Backpacked 7/12/2019 -
First off this hike is amazing. Awesome views!  Over the weekend some friends and I tackled this peak from the apline side.  We took the Deer creek / Dry creek trail up and camped at the south saddle at ~10,000feet.  Sleeping was tough because of the mosquitoes so we moved our camp to the ridge where we had more of a breeze to keep them at bay.  We made the mistake to take the Phelps canyon trail down.  It was totally overgrown and impossibly to follow. (We had a gps overlay of the route so it helped somewhat ). Still required tons of bushwacking. GIving it a 4 because of the bugs.(probably just due to the time of year.)  Took us 6 - 7 hours up. 3.5 hours down."
10,2019-07-11,"['hiking', 'over grown']","The dog and I made the summit for sunset last night. (7-11)  The trail is definitely over-grown in many areas.  In very few spots did we have to cross over snow and it was never difficult (only had hiking boots and my trekking poles)  Only saw one other hiker and he made it with no poles..A reminder on the way down from the summit to stay right along the ridge line the best you can so you don't end up veering off into the snow fields in the trees.  Only gave it 4 stars for last night as there were a ton of mosquitoes from start to finish, both ways..hopefully this will change - I've never seen the bugs that bad on this trail..awesome panorama view from top - Timp, tibble, silver lake flat, pfeiferrhorn, lone peak, and much more.."
11,2019-07-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']",Great views of timp and lone peak the snow the last mile or so was kind of sketchy but you can kind of go around it be careful going down easy to loose the trail on the way down and get lost in the snow 
12,2019-07-04,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'snow']","Hiked 7/4/19
First of all this trail is a gem. It is beautiful and I only passed 3 groups all day. You have great views of timp to the south and lone peak, pfeifferhorn, and baldy to the north. However, much of the trail is overgrown with vegetation, not terrible, but you're usually brushing up against something. Today, there were many points where the trail was washed out or had trees tipped over on the trail. The first two miles are pretty mellow, but then it picks up after that and gets steeper with the trail having loose rocks for footing for sections. I made it to the last mile stretch to the top only passing intermittent sections of snow. Within about a half mile or so of the peak the snow covered the trail completely and the last mile is very steep plus it was slushy and slippery. I had micro spikes and hiking poles, but I would have needed an ice axe to feel safe. I saw a group just ahead of me have to do an ice axe arrest after slipping and sliding. I only made it to about 10,000 feet today, which was disappointing, but I'll be back to summit. It probably still needs another 2-3 weeks before it's safe without the proper equipment."
13,2018-10-15,['hiking'],"Hiked the summit in Sept when leaves were at there best. Started from Granite Flats going up Deer Creek Trail, great hike except for last mile it is straight up, no switch backs. Came down bushwhacking through cliffs to the north of the peak, fun trail finding adventure. Caught an unmarked trail that loops around a no name peak east of Box Elder summit and went south connecting to and down Box Elder Trail. Took us 6.5 hours."
14,2018-09-29,['trail running'],"An awesome wasatch run. Great views of box elder peak almost the entire way up. Great for viewing the yellow aspen leaves during fall time. I saw elk, mountain goats and mule deer on this late afternoon run. Brought 1.5 liters of water and ran out 15 mins from the bottom."
15,2018-09-23,['hiking'],"Incredible!  Somewhat deceptively long going up trail#043 as you have great views of the summit essentially the whole hike. trail is well maintained and easy to follow with plenty of switch backs and decent grade (until summit push). Next time I will bring my Australian Shepard.  
I did a variation of the loop and well worth it!  I came off the south side of Box Elder and used a game trail to summit the no name peak just to the south.... & was awesome!  Particularly because I spooked a family of ~15 Mountain Goats (no joke.... 15!) I then dropped off the no name peak to the trail #044 you could actually see below (from summit of the no name peak) but be warned this way is very STEEP route finding with some sketchy parts but once on #044 was “smooth” sailing and is a cruiser of a trail"
16,2018-09-10,['hiking'],"Hiked to the summit with the dog last week.  Ran into one other hiker.  Love the solitude on this trail.  A couple miles up the trail you will have several views of the ponds off to your left - this time I saw a moose down by the water..really cool..The red leaves are gorgeous right now...Wanted to try this White Pine trail #188 I believe on the way down, but it was dark and didn't want to risk it...will try the loop next time..My garmin showed about 11.5 miles roundtrip..."
17,2018-09-07,['hiking'],"An amazing hike.  It is brutal and not for the faint of heart.  It's about 4.8 miles to the top from Silver Lake Flat road.  The maple type trees were at their peak of redness, aspens just starting to turn.  It was about 60 degrees up on top.  The trail to community flats (#043) is easy to follow but can feel misleading because you spend a lot of time heading north away from Box Elder but does eventually swing you around to the meadow at community flats.  At the trail sign in the meadow you follow the trail that goes south (#188).  You have to watch carefully for the cut off to the summit off #188.  You'll see #188 head down and off to the left, to summit you want to head up the steep incline to the right toward 2 aspens and next to a scraggly lone pine.  The trail from there to the top is mostly easy to see but sometimes a little sketch.  You do spend a lot of time in the trees which was a pleasant surprise.  The trail above the trees is STEEP and rocky and it's a ridge trail so at times it's pretty scary (drop offs on both sides).  There's a huge rock abutment that seems impassable with the trail teetering around the east side.  Turns out at that point you're only 50 yards from the top and you can skip the trail and just climb straight up the middle of the abutment and you're there!!!  The views are stunning 360 degrees of jaw dropping beauty.  Quiet and peaceful. We saw one hiker and one hunter at community flats.  We had the mountain to ourselves."
18,2018-09-04,['hiking'],"Has become one of my favorites! A less traveled trail if you take the full loop. Crosses over various terrain from pine forests, meadows, aspen groves, to scrambling and granite and rocky. Multiple view point ledges. Multiple valleys and ridges (ups and downs). Saw some wildlife...fox, elk, deer, eagles, and more. Challenging hike but very worth it!"
19,2018-09-03,['hiking'],"Although lacking in technical difficulty (no scrambling, bouldering or trail-finding) this hike proves to be challenging due to its length and steepness (especially towards the summit). 

Excellent views of Alpine, North and South across the Wasatch range and out West looking out to the Uintahs. 

Made the full loop by starting out at the Granite Flats Campground Trailhead and made my way back via White Canyon trail (highly recommended). 

As you descend, White Pine Canyon trail will jut off to the right cutting down and across the forest. 

For some reason the peak remains pretty secluded but I absolutely loved it! 

:-) <3 _/|\_"
20,2018-09-01,['backpacking'],"We started from the trailhead just outside the Granite Flats campground around 4:00-4:30 pm, and made it to the meadow by 7:00 to camp overnight before going to the summit the next morning. The constant switchbacks you follow making it to that point weren’t great, and were steep, but pretty typical of what you see anywhere else in the Wasatch. 

Climbing to the summit to the meadow can basically be summed up in one word: steep! Not a lot of bouldering like other peaks around it, and actually pretty decent shade as you summit from the meadow. The views at the top are great, especially of Timp on the south and Pfeifferhorn on the north. There’s also plenty of room at the top, unlike a lot of other peaks in the area.

We made this trip in late July and still had some snow, but nothing on the trail itself. Overnighting was fun, but you can definitely do this as a one day trip too."
21,2018-08-17,['hiking'],"I've done this peak a few times now.  Definitely do the loop after the peak.  There was never anyone on the trail when I hiked it, usually mid week.  I saw some bull elk just off the trail.  Recommended for sure."
22,2018-08-16,['hiking'],"Pros:
- Awesome views of the surrounding peaks including Box Elder the whole way
- Opportunities to see wildlife
- Wild flowers
- Hardly anyone on the trail, even on a Saturday in prime hiking season

Cons:
- Really steep (my GPS tracker told me 5177 ft elevation gain when dips and gains are factored in both ways)
- Exposed (hot the whole way)
- No water outside of roughly the first mile.

I would say this hike was harder than Timp or Nebo. I would recommend starting early (5 or 6 in the morning) to avoid the heat in the summer. I would also recommend bringing more liquid than you think you need, then bring some more. I started at 8, and despite having a large camelbak and 40 oz of Gatorade, I ran out of liquid with about 4 miles left in the hike. That is my fault for not rationing water very well at the beginning of the hike.

All things considered, this is still a really incredible hike that I would recommend to very experienced hikers in good shape. Definitely a cool peak to bag."
23,2018-08-03,[''],"Awesome hike. My brother and I have played soccer our whole lives and are very active and decided on our off day to do this hike. We aren't in peak physical condition right now, but we are probably in better shape than the average person. We found it to be a good challenge, especially the final third of the ascent. It's steep as heck. Took us about 3.5 hrs to reach the summit and 1.5 hrs to get back down with some running. Definitely bring plenty of water. All in all the view is great and the trail is beautiful. Would definitely recommend it."
24,2018-07-08,['hiking'],One of our favorite hikes in Utah Valley. The hike itself is fairly rigorous and you get to experience some varied terrain along the way. The view at the top is an amazing pay off for the journey up. What makes this hike one of the best in the area is because it is often looked over. We had the whole trail to ourselves on a Saturday. Being able to get lost in the wilderness for a few hours make this an amazing experience.
25,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"Pros: Good views. Solitude. Flowers. Get to enjoy an 11k foot peak to yourself most likely. 

Cons: Hot and exposed to the sun with little to no shade. No reliable water sources. Relentlessly steep, particularly the last third. 

If you do it I suggest bringing 1 gallon of water per person. That's what I took and it was just about the perfect amount."
26,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"I dont think this area gets enough credit. I think this is one of the best hikes in the Valley but this website has a lot of funny hikes ranked higher. I think the views and challenge of this hike are better than anything else the area has to offer. My wife and I did this with our 3 month old a few years ago and loved it. I do only give it a 3 star simply because hiking in other parts of Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming is just better and I cant just give out 4 and 5 stars to everything I like!"
27,2018-07-01,[''],"Gorgeous trail and very few people (I only saw 3 people during peak hiking hours). The middle portion of the trail is a tad overgrown, but not as bad as I expected. The final mile is pretty difficult, but the view is definitely worth it. I hike quite fast and it took me roughly 2.5 hours up and 2 down. A trail for true adventurers!"
28,2018-06-24,[''],"Very over-grown but beautiful! The wildflowers are out now, too! My watch caught the distance as 12.4, but probably because I parked my car just down the road a bit. Bring plenty of water, there is only one good stream to fill up at!"
29,2018-06-08,[''],"I loved this hike.  Spring in the Mountains is so beautiful.  The trees mostly have leaves now. This trails goes through beautiful groves of conifers, maples, gamble oaks, and aspens.  There  are a good number of flowers blooming now and many more are just starting to grow. There are beautiful views of the mountains for most of the hike.  When you reach the saddle where you meet the Dry Creek trail, you can see down into Alpine.  The view from the top was slectacular.  I could see all the way to the Uintas to the east.  there were  great views of the valleys to the west including Utah Lake and even a part of the Great Salt Lake.  There were  great views of the surrounding Wasatch range including Lone Peak and mount Timpanogas.  The weather was perfection today with clear blue skies and very little wind.  There were only a few spots I had to cross very small patches of snow.  My trekking poles were a help with that.  The part of the trail that makes the final ascent up Box Elder Peak is very steep and a bit slippery because the trail itself is not well defined.  It's more like a maze of very lightly worn tracks from previous hikers through the wooded parts and other rocky areas where it's a scramble.  If you stay right on or very close to the ridgeline you will make it up.  In general, almost all the trail is very rocky and many of the rocks are loose.  I would definitely agree this is a hard hike.  It is lightly traveled.  I was on the trail most of the day and only crossed paths with a dozen people."
30,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"First part of the trail had nice steady gains and was pretty easy, I took my time and enjoyed the beautiful scenery! Then after you get past the big field where the trails converge it get really steep and you have to take your time. Great views from the top and would definitely do this one again! One of the best hikes I’ve been on, since moving here 4 months ago."
31,2018-06-02,['hiking'],"Used the Horsetail Falls trail today to summit Box Elder Peak. Hang a right just before the falls at a signed intersection to keep ascending on 2043, then keep on trucking for a good while until you get to a spot where you can see down into the Granite Flat Campground. From here, you swing south on 2188 and basically just go up and up and up until you're at the top of Box Elder Peak! 

Saw oodles of wildflowers on this first day of June; oodles more are on the way in the next few weeks I'm sure. There's still snow up high, though nothing terrible as long as you're not the kind of person who likes to test their luck on avoidable cornices. I liked having my waterproof boots and gaiters, but I like fancy/luxurious things like that. 

Probably something like 5,500ft of vertical gain all told?"
32,2018-05-28,[''],Great view and worth the work to get there! Went last Friday and was still postholing in slushy snow within 1 mile of the top.
33,2018-05-27,['hiking'],"Great hike.  We summitted yesterday, May 26th via the trailhead from Granite Flats campground.  We were able to do it with no snow equipment and just running shoes - but you do need to hike through some snow on the north side.  As has been mentioned it is not a popular hike - thankfully!  The campgrounds were all full for memorial day weekend but we saw about 6 people the whole time up the mountain.  This hike has a little bit of everything.  When you turn south heading towards the peak, make sure and find a trail heading up along the ridge - if not, you might start heading below and around the east side of the mountain and miss the ridge.  We followed a group of 3 guys who made nice tracks in the snow - there was a couple hundred yards of snow to get through, but most of the hike was clear.  There are a few steep spots at the beginning of the ridge ascent.  Trekking poles were definitely helpful.. On the way down we went too far west and didn't stay on the ridge and had to hike through deep snow to get back on track...We probably went 400 meters off course, even still the hike showed over 12 miles on both of our Garmins and checking with the others they had similar marks.  This is at least 11-12 miles total it seems.  The views on top of Timp, and the Alpine mountains - were incredible.  One of my new favorite hikes!  Also - the road from Tibble Fork to Granite Flat campground is now open."
34,2018-05-07,['hiking'],@ Erin - Most of the trail didn't have any snow until you get closer to the top.  You have to park at the lake parking lot and walk a mile on the pavement to get to the trailhead but it's an absolutely gorgeous view.
35,2018-05-07,['hiking'],Does anyone know if this is still covered with deep snow near the summit? 5/6/2018
36,2017-11-17,['hiking'],11/15/17 What a hike! That last 1.5 to the summit is STEEP as crud! So well worth it! Saw a mountain goat on the south west ridge as we were about to summit. Too bad we didn't get there at the same time. I can't wait to return in July when the wild flowers are out!
37,2017-11-02,[''],Extremely steep. It is a challenge but worth it!
38,2017-09-15,['hiking'],"I enjoyed the hike. I actually did a circle. So far, none of these AllTrails hike show it this way. Started near the Granite Flats campground entrance. Hiked on Trail 43 to Trail 188. About a mile or so, there is an unmarked trail to the Box Elder Peak Summit. I have a GPX to share, if needed. Then hiked back to trail 188 and turned right. Followed that to Trail 44 back to the Granite Flats campground. Most of Trail 188 beyond the Box Elder Peak turnoff is very much overgrown, but not hard to stay on the trail. I loved it, because I was alone most of the day. Here is a Strava Link, if it helps. https://www.strava.com/activities/1168712457"
39,2017-08-29,['hiking'],"This was a good challenging hike! The view is absolutely gorgeous at the top. You get a great view of the valley, as well as some of the other peaks nearby like timp and pfeifferhorn! Just be careful of moose if you are planning on hiking in he early hours of the morning. 2 were very close to our trail and slowed us down a bit!"
40,2017-08-26,['hiking'],The views at the summit are some of the best I've seen.  There was even some mountain goats near the summit.  The last mile is pretty steep and gave my legs a great workout.  Tons of wild flowers across the saddle before the summit.
41,2017-08-21,[''],Beautiful hike! Easy to follow trail and lovely view.
42,2017-08-03,['hiking'],"Great views of Lone Peak, Timp, and Utah, Salt Lake, and Wasatch counties.  

You pay your dues on the hike from the saddle to the peak, and that seems to keep the crowds away.  There's a good chance you'll have the views all to yourself!"
43,2017-07-29,['hiking'],
44,2017-07-13,['hiking'],Need to summit this!
45,2017-07-04,['hiking'],The last bit from the saddle to the peak is pretty tough. Trail is fairly easy to follow all the way to the top and as of July 3 2017 there's almost no snow left to get in the way. Bring plenty of water unless you plan on melting snow. Views are incredible. This is the perfect early season alternative to Timpanogos while it's still snowbound.
46,2017-07-03,['hiking'],Amazing hike. The second half was steep but well worth it-the views were incredible. Took my group 6 hours of hiking at a decent pace.
47,2017-06-18,['hiking'],Still a little snow that you have to cross in places. Had to turn back .3 miles from the top on account of time. The views would have been better if most of the surrounding peaks hasn't been covered in clouds. The views all along the trail was amazing
48,2017-01-08,[''],BEAT.
49,2016-10-02,['hiking'],"This hike is tough.  Lots of incline going up from the parking area.  This is marked hard for a reason.  Also this hike says 7.9 miles but when I tracked it, came out to about 9.1 miles so I don't know whats going on there.  Me and another person completed this in 5 hours but we were trucking the 2nd half.  Speaking of 2nd half, the trail is very narrow and sometimes its difficult to know which is the trail and which is not lol.  I would highly suggest doing this trail tho, the views were Amazing and it was not very trafficked so it was very peaceful."
50,2016-09-07,['hiking'],This hike is awesome. One of my favorites in any of the wasatch canyons. Highly recommend this hike.
51,2016-07-23,['hiking'],"Awesome hike. Start early so it's cooler. Areas that get really steep. Phenomenal views the whole entire time you're going. Up is fun, down is pretty awful not going to lie. Steep areas are pretty slippery on the way down. Make sure you have good shoes and plenty of food and water! Hard....but 110% worth it!"
52,2016-06-25,['hiking'],"Whatever you don't attempt box elder peak via phelps trail from dry canyon, right now there is just a wood en post but there should be a sign saying TRAIL CLOSED!!!!! Trail out granite flat campground is spectacular"
53,2015-11-18,['hiking'],This was.a favorite for me so beautiful always something gorgeous to see
54,2015-11-09,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite peaks of the Wasatch. It's under-appreciated which means solitude. If you're looking for challenge, solitude, views, and wildlife, this is your hike. 
The trail splits a mile or so up to the north and south. I prefer wrapping around the south end of the peak where more water sources can be found, and I think it's altogether more beautiful, particularly the view of Timp to the south. 
There are mountain goats on the north side of the peak, in the bowl. They can be hard to spot, but if they move along those cliffs they are sure to dislodge some rocks that will echo through the whole bowl. 
I LOVE this hike, so much I considered giving it a poor review in hopes to keep more people off it."
55,2015-09-12,['hiking'],"I really knew nothing about this trail before starting out....but quickly found out its steep and hard and probably best done with a partner along.  It was beautiful - stunning vistas all around, but I wasn't far up the trail, maybe 1.5 miles before I decided to tackle this one another day."
56,2015-08-09,[''],"One of the most seldom visited 11,000 foot peaks along the Wasatch Front is Box Elder Peak. This ""Elevener"" is often overlooked because of 11,253 foot Lone Peak to the north of it, and 11,749 foot Mount Timpanogos to the south. This is a beautiful area, and the peak is well-worth the effort.

Most likely, you'll have the summit to yourself. Great views in all directions!"
57,2015-06-27,['hiking'],"This was a fantastic, grueling hike that produced some of the most spectacular views in Utah County. I feel Box Elder Peak often gets overshadowed by neighboring Mt. Timpanogos, and nearby Mt. Nebo, but I feel the views and hike were equally as impressive as both of those hikes. From the top, you get great views of Utah Valley, nearby Lone Peak, Pfeifferhorn, White Baldy, and Mt. Timpanogos. You can see Mt. Nebo and Santaquiin in the distance. It's breathtaking. The hike itself reminded me a lot of Mt. Nebo, even following a similar  pattern, although this was longer. However, the climb to the summit of this one is what separates it from anything else in the area. It. Was. Tough. I mean tough. Many areas you easily 35-40% grade consistently for long stretches. If you have trekking poles, don't forget them for this one. If you don't have poles, buy some before this hike. They'll be worth their weight in gold. This time of year (June), there were abundant wildflowers growing in many of the alpine areas, covering the horizon with purples, yellows, and reds. This is easily now one of my top 10 favorite hikes in the SLC/Utah County area, and it's by far one of the most underrated hikes around."
58,2015-05-13,['hiking'],"Just arrived into town from Nebraska for a summer internship and decided to tackle this beast right off the bat. Started at Granite Flats and made it to the meadow, come to find out there was a lot more snow than I expected. I guess it's still pretty early so I will be definitely be back a little later to peak it. Overall stellar first hike of the summer!"
59,2013-12-20,['hiking'],I did this as an overnight hike with my 14 yo daughter. We took the road to Silver Lake past Granite Flats CG and started on the trail head a few turns up the road. I takes a little distance out of the hike. It took about 5 hours to reach the meadow. We were surprised to find about 8 inches of snow. We quickly made camp and a fire and prepared for a cold night! The snow made us decide to not summit Box Elder Peak the next morning. We didn't hurry out the next morning but the hike down hill to Alpine seemed to last forever!! It was so pretty and enjoyable and will do it again! We never had any trouble finding water. It is a 12 hours hike. 6 hours up and 6 down without the summit to the peak. With those hours of hiking the mileage seems off.

The views are spectacular, the sense of accomplishment is phenomenal, and the wild flowers are beautiful. A truly amazing wonder, and if done right, one flipping incredible experience. :)"
61,2013-07-10,['hiking'],"Started hiking with Dave Beck at Granite Flats Campground at 6:30 am and finished in Alpine at 6:30 pm.  Absolutely stunning views!  Hard 12-hour hike - 5 hours up the mountain from the start at Granite Flats campground and 7 hours down to Alpine.  Shrubs and flowers were in full bloom the entire way.  Some of the trails across the slide areas were covered with slate.  Large mud slides at the end of the trail due to hard rains the night before covered the trailhead parking lot in Alpine.  Did not run into any other person on the entire trail until close to the end.  Unfortunately, we didn't see any wildlife the entire trip.  We didn't anticipate the length of time it would take and should have packed more than just nuts and granola bars.  Drank water from various streams without incident after camelbacks went dry."

I've done this trail twice thus far and to date have run into a total of 1 other person on the trail.  The final climb to the peek is not well marked and contains a fair amount of scrambling.  Pack lots of water and hiking poles would serve well.  I believe starting at Granit Flat camp ground up American Fork canyon trail number 43 was 12 miles total.  "
