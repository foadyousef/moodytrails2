0,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Great views on either side! We saw about 20 mountain goats on the west side. Gradual ascent the entire way.
1,2019-08-26,['hiking'],"Great trail with excellent views of Weber county and Ogden valley. We clocked 8.4 miles from North Ogden divide to the peak. (1.4 miles from the saddle to the peak.) Except for a few spots, the grade is mild and very manageable. "
2,2019-08-26,['hiking'],Still some nice wild flowers about 4 miles into the hike. 8/25/2019
3,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"A big take always from this hike, bring more water than you think you’ll need. I ran out with a few miles left, not a good idea. If you start in the morning, you’ll be in direct sun for the rest of the day. Also, the roar of the motorbikes take away from the pristine environment. Still a very challenging long hike but very epic in its own way. "
4,2019-08-19,['hiking'],"Constant breath-taking beauty, without it being a breath-stealing hike. The incline is very steady and continuous, but totally doable, even carrying on a conversation,  but, it is VERY long! Carry plenty of water! I also strongly recommend  a head-lamp or flashlight if doing the whole trip.  One of the best ""view hikes"" ever!"
5,2019-08-13,['hiking'],Great trail on the way up. About a mile from the top we had to stop do to three moose hanging out on the trail. Waited about 45 minutes for them to leave but decided to just call it a day and headed back down.

7,2019-08-04,['hiking'],this hike slaps y’all should do it 
8,2019-07-28,"['trail running', 'no shade', 'rocky']","Great trail to take very early, before it heats up, or late on a summer evening as the start of the trail has a southern exposure with out much shade. 
Once the trail crests the ridge and turns north, the trail conditions improve from loose limestone to smooth dirt. Once you reach the summit ridge and crest over to the West side (with views of Ogden and the Great Salt Lake), the trail flattens our for the most part and runs just below the ride towards the peak before a few more short switchbacks as you reach the saddle where the trail joins with the North Fork trail. 

At this point you can choose to continue on the Ben Lomond Summit on a series of loose and steep switchbacks, and/or travel West to summit the talker WILLARD Peak, or turn around and descend via the trail on which you arrived or descend via the North Fork trail (which will NOT return you to your start point, but drop you down to North Fork Park, Mike’s from your start point.) 

Great trail with a very good chance of seeing wildlife including: deer, mountain goats, or possibly black bears (which are extremely rare sightings).

Trail running is fun but take plenty of water. Mountain biking is also fun because of the long consistent downhill descent!

Cell service is usually good in all locations."

10,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"Hiked it 7/20/19. I got to the trailhead at 6:30AM and the parking lot was full. I parked right outside the lot though where there’s a wide shoulder. The hike up was really pleasant and beautiful at that hour. Still some slippery snow fields to cross near the top of the peak, and some sections of water running down the trail. Making the trek back down between 10 and 1 was pretty miserable in the heat. Lots of trail runners, mountain bikers, and dirt bikers. Everyone was respectful. Great hike!!!"
11,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"Great hike! Had to scramble around some snow on the ending switchbacks.  Beautiful at the top. Tons of butterflys and dragonflys everywhere. Really not steep at all, just long gradually inclined switchbacks. A little long but definitely worth the trip!"
12,2019-07-14,['hiking'],Great trail. It's steep but worth it. We only went 3 miles up since we started late. Beautiful wildflowers everywhere and the views were spectacular of Ogden and the valley. I consider this trail as one of the best!
13,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'rocky']","We only intended to climb to the top of the switchbacks today. Great views of the valley and of Ogden. You can see the top of Mount Ogden from the top. Very rocky on most of the trail, like walking on marbles. Beautiful hike though. The trail was dry. We saw a rubber boa snake, cool to see, non venomous. Hard steep climb but we liked it."
14,2019-06-20,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","Gorgeous, the dog gave up on the way back but I'll definitely be doing this again. It did get a little sketchy at one point from slip."
15,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Did 14.4 miles in 4:40. I went 7.2 miles up before I was forced to turn around...just no safe way to make it the last 0.3 miles to the peak safely as it was a steep soft snow slope to climb the rest. I was sad to go that far but not to reach the actual peak. So close!
This isn't my favorite hike this time of year. Just too much snow, unclearpath, mud, muck, snow runoff on the trail. The first 3.5 miles were great and pretty, but the next 4 miles have diminishing returns as far as pretty trails go. The rest was pretty scruffy looking and poor trail conditions. 
I would instead suggest Hidden Valley and Taylor Canyon this time of year instead. It was such a pretty and great hike overall. "
16,2019-06-05,[''],"Amazing hike, first time I've done a hike like this. I was 52 at the time with no preparation at all and I was in pain for 5 days after :). "
17,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Trail was in great shape until we hit the pines, from there is was just easier to make our own trail through the snow.  Made it up to the saddle and crossed over to the west aide of the mountains.  Finished up the day just below chilly peak.  Ben was looking awesome, but just too much today."
18,2018-11-22,['hiking'],Super hard. Gorgeous views. Can’t wait to do it again.
19,2018-10-09,['hiking'],"This was a great hike. It is correctly labeled as ""hard,"" but only because of the distance. The trail is a steady climb up switchbacks for a few miles, and then several miles of ridge-walking, before a strenuous climb to the summit that lasts approximately one mile. By the time that I was done, my joints were aching and I was very tired, but only because I had hiked 17 miles, and not because of any particularly difficult section.

We saw moose and mountain goats, and we signed our names in the log book at the summit. It was a great day."
20,2018-09-23,[''],"Great time of year to hike (late September), some shade, autumn colors, cooler temps."
21,2018-09-05,[''],Loved this hike!
22,2018-08-21,[''],Difficult but doable. Packing for overnight is not recommended as it’s very hot and steep. Saturday Hammock camp and Sunday morning summit was epic though. Wish there wasn’t so much smoke!
23,2018-07-15,['backpacking'],Nice
24,2018-07-07,[''],"Great hike, suggest you start out early to avoid the heat while maximizing nature moments"
25,2018-06-24,[''],"This may be my favorite hike in the Ogden area. I disagree with the rating on this trail and would categorize it as moderate. It’s long, but the elevation gain is gradual for most of the trail. After you reach the saddle, that’s where the toughest part begins. The trail up to the summit can be steep in parts, but it’s not a long distance and the payoff at the top is well worth the effort - you won’t be disappointed."
26,2018-05-09,['off road driving'],Awesome ride with great views. Soil drains well but try and stay off after a heavy rain or until snow is melted.  Please remember this is a Dirt Bike-accessible trail hikers be polite and let riders pass. Riders keep the speeds down!
27,2017-11-03,[''],"Just a side note : you have ran out of water due to bad planning or what ever .. once you’v hiked to Ben Lomond Peak you need to hike to Willard Basin another 2.5 miles .. on the road by the camp ground there’s a 3” pipe that has fresh clean water running out of it .. year round .. refill your water bladder and or bottles . Stay and rehydrate then head back down .. or call for a ride back .. this road is called inspiration Point Drive it comes out in Mantua in sardine canyon . 
Make sure to tell the person coming to get you to stay right at the fork the Basin is 2 miles past the Willard Basin sign.. ... Happy Trails .. Plan .. Be Smart .. Take water with you ..tell someone where your hiking .."
28,2017-09-11,['hiking'],"Very difficult, demanding trail. The ascent to the peak itself is crazy hard, and coming back down the way you came all the way back to the north ogden divide trailhead will feel like an eternity. But I'm so glad we did it. Amazing views the entire way. Felt like a huge accomplishment! Bring LOTS of water. And lots of energy/protein snacks."
29,2017-09-08,['hiking'],Pretty rugged hike towards the top but the views are spectacular!!
30,2017-09-06,['hiking'],"Did this hike in mid August. we started at North fork park. We only saw one other person before the trail met up with the north ogden divide trail. also, motorcycles are not allowed on the north fork park side. we saw 2 bull moose and a ton of gorgeous wildflowers. it was a moderate climb until you got to the switch backs to the peak. the views were spectacular and well worth it! Pack lunch and plenty of water. it took us about 7.5 hours but we stayed at the top for about 40 minutes and the 2 bull moose on the trail slowed us down a bit, too."
31,2017-09-03,[''],"Will drink lots of water due to being in sun exposure. I'm assuming hard due to distance. Fairly moderate most the way. Seen a pair of bull moose, mountain goats"
32,2017-09-03,['hiking'],Took 7 1/2 hours and a LOT of water. Would recommend bringing a gallon a person.
33,2017-08-18,['hiking'],"I did ben lomond yesterday, initial went on the wrong trail for quite some time before locating the unmarked trail. a lot of this hike was very sun-exposed and dusty, so i recommend doing this very early or late. i also didn't't like how motorcross folk are allowed up there, didn't like breathing exhaust with my hike. however, there are several beautiful spots,especially toward the top. The length made for an intense but doable hike. I wouldnt do it again unless it was raining or had just rained"
34,2017-08-07,[''],"The only difficult part about this trail is that it's so long. The trail has a steady incline most of the way, however it just keeps going up forever. The views at the top are worth the effort"
35,2017-07-29,['hiking'],Great hike. Worth the view. BUT..... I hope you ready for a hard hike. It's really long obviously but the beginning and near the Ben Lomond Peak are some serious switchbacks in order to get up the mountain. Great hike though. If you're in the shape for it do it. Also take lots of water AND FOOD
