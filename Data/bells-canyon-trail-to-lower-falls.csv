3,2019-09-04,['hiking'],"Nice half day trail. Out and back took us 4 hours, including lunch and some bouldering on the rocks above the falls. The lower portion of the trail is exposed, so be prepared for some sun. We saw hikers of all ages and fitness levels. The last 1/4 of the trail is steep and rocky, but nothing more than big steps. ",
4,2019-09-03,['hiking'],"Amazing views, a little harder than expected towards the end but worth the view!",
5,2019-09-03,"['hiking', 'rocky']",A bit longer then stated,
6,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike with amazing waterfalls! Gets a little rocky, but worth the climb! ",
7,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'closed']","If you’re hiking to big baldy, you’re out of luck. The trail is closed not long after after the 2nd water crossing. They are doing major work on the trail. We climbed up a bit to check it out- it’s nothing but  a steep road with loads of fine dirt. It is, however, well worth a visit to climb to the falls (and a little bit passed.) The water is so robust. It really helped temper this late summer heat. Use bug repellent-the horseflies are pretty aggressive. ",

9,2019-08-31,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",rocky but worth it the waterfalls is amazing ,
10,2019-08-31,['hiking'],"saw my first rattlesnake, backed away carefully. I did see paddleboarders and dogs up there in the last two weeks. If there is no swimming allowed and dogs is crossed out on the sign (if I remember correctly) why are people doing this? Also saw someone with pistol on their hip-i understand but thought it had to be concealed. Anyone know the rules on what is not allowed and not allowed? love this hike, just wondering about the rules and going to make a few calls.
",
11,2019-08-30,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","Amazing hike.  We left too late for this hot Utah day, so we spent a good part of the hike in the blazing sun. 2 trail heads. We prefer the one from little Cottonwood vs. wasatch.  Wasatch is more of a boulder scramble, while little Cottonwood meanders.  I have never been in the afternoon, and will try to avoid it in the future.  

After the turn off for the waterfall, it is shadier than the lower part of the trail. In the mornings, nice and cool on the lower part of the trail from trail head on  little Cottonwood side. 

Also, in the afternoon, it was a little buggie towards the top.  Didn’t notice that when I have gone in the mornings. 

As other’s have said, last part of the hike, a bit past the sign that says .7 miles to waterfall, it can be a little brutal, kinda steep and kinda a lot of boulders, but well worth it!  (Another reason to start off little Cottonwood.  You won’t be as tired for the upper boulder scramble, because you didn’t already have a boulder scramble on the first part of the hike)

I hope this is helpful.  ",
12,2019-08-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']",One of my favorite hikes! The end is so worth it. The first part is a lot of climbing and the very end is steep and Rocky for the last little bit! The waterfall is beautiful and I sit up there for a long time after.,
13,2019-08-30,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",,
14,2019-08-30,['hiking'],Beautiful. Some steep sections but do able. Try to do in early am or late afternoon if can,
15,2019-08-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']",I've done the trail to the lake (reservoir) and walked around it about a total of 5 times. love it. had only 1 snake encounter but was not a rattlesnake. I then did the hike to the first waterfall. I'd say it was difficult because of how steep it gets and it never seems to end. The end result though it's totally worth it. ,
16,2019-08-28,['hiking'],This trail was closer to hard than moderate. The first mile is a breeze and the last .5 mile is really tough. I wouldn’t recommend doing this trail alone unless you are an experienced hiker. The waterfall is beautiful though.,
17,2019-08-27,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Definitely would recommend this one!! Perfect length, the last little bit is a little more rocky and steep but totally worth the beautiful waterfall at the end. Bring good shoes, going down took a toll on my toes haha",
18,2019-08-27,['hiking'],My first hike ever and I’m hooked. I almost quit 3 times but so glad I pushed through. Beautiful scenery. ,
19,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Steep in parts. But a good length, good scenery, beautiful waterfall at the end. Highly recommend",
20,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'scramble']",6 v688 ????? 8 ???? ??,
21,2019-08-24,['hiking'],Good trail very pretty but hike ended early because I saw a rattlesnake right next to the trail.,
22,2019-08-19,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",Pretty rocky the further up you get but not too bad at all...the waterfall and view is more than worth it! Highly recommend. ,
23,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'rocky']",We did this trail right at sunset. It was absolutely beautiful. The lake was nice too. We didn’t go past the lake though. So we didn’t see any waterfall like in the pictures.  It was rocky but not bad. My 9 and 6 year old did great! ,
24,2019-08-17,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",This is a magnificent trail with some scenic views of the valley. The hike up to the reservoir from granite trailhead was not too bad. From there onward to the waterfall is a bit rocky with quite a bit of bugs so make sure to keep insect repellant. Keep plenty of water and snacks.,
25,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"Rocky trail. lot of elevation gain. most of the trail is exposed. the last 0.5 miles is like climbing stairs... big stairs. waterfall was beautiful. still a lot of water, even this late in the season.",
26,2019-08-17,['hiking'],Good trail for all levels though steep and rocky  last part to falls. Good hike,
27,2019-08-15,"['hiking', 'rocky']",,
28,2019-08-15,['hiking'],"Very fun, it's a good hike that's a bit of a work out but all in all a good medium difficulty. There were some good sights between the falls, creek, and reservoir. ",
29,2019-08-14,['hiking'],The reservoir is nice. The waterfall mist is delightful. Many beautiful views to capture in a panorama once you reach the waterfall. The end is steep and rocky but the steepness is just due to big high steps on the boulders for 10-15 min. Not steep from your feet being angled at 45 degrees or more. ,
30,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",The waterfall is worth the hike. The last 1/2 mile up to the waterfall is very rocky and steep. ,
31,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"fun trail and awesome waterfall
",
32,2019-08-10,['hiking'],"Reviews are accurate about the last 0.5 mile or so being very steep, but the falls and the view are well worth it.

We took 20 extra minutes and followed a small trail that lopped around the reservoir, which was really pretty. ",
33,2019-08-08,['hiking'],"Great hike, steep and rocky at the end but doable.   Certainly worth it when you get to the top of the falls.   ",
34,2019-08-07,['hiking'],Beautiful! Definitley a good workout! Natural AC from the falls and river!,
35,2019-08-06,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Gets harder the closer you get to the waterfall but totally worth it. Bring plenty of water,
36,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Super fun hike, especially with the mist blast from the waterfall at top. I recommend choosing a route where the trail is next to the downpour stream. Most challenging section is the last 1/4th to the top with steep and rocky terrain. ",
37,2019-08-04,['hiking'],Great hike with great views. Hard on the knees coming back down with all the boulders to step down from. ,
38,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'scramble']","This is an absolutely great trail. but be prepared to do some good solid hiking. I may experience tiger with more than 20 years on trails oh, and this one was one of my favorites that I've been to so far in Utah. Let me caution anyone who isn't in what you would consider excellent shape 3 liters of water minimum and definitely let someone know where you're going. ",
39,2019-08-03,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! It gets steep and rocky at the top but it's worth it. ,
40,2019-08-01,"['hiking', 'rocky']","pretty hike! we would say its moderate til the end part is pretty steep. waterfall was running hard, so pretty! it took us 2 hours 40 mins roundtrip to complete. glad we went early morning was hot as we came dow down ",
41,2019-07-31,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",Very hot. Not much shade . The last 1/2 mile was a steep hike. Very beautiful when you get to the fall.,
42,2019-07-27,['hiking'],wonderful. had a lush and tropical feel with the moisture/ humidity in the air today. well marked trail and very friendly hikers. 1:40 to complete it. ,
43,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","This hike was beautiful! I went early morning to beat the sun and I’m glad I did, the hike down was hot. There’s a beautiful lake where you can catch and release fish and a bridge. The higher you get, the more in the trees, there was a lot of bugs because of the morning. You could hear the river from the trail and the cold water made it cooler. Towards the top it got pretty hard but it was totally worth it to see the beautiful waterfall, which also cools you down. ITS SUPER STEEP SO DONT SLIP. The hike back is mostly downhill. ",
44,2019-07-26,['hiking'],Excellent hike.  The last 3/4 mile is where the climb gets real. ,
45,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'over grown']",,
46,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"This trail is awesome, lots of traffic but worth it. The last 1.5m is a total but kicker with at 47% grade.",
47,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","This is a hard hike. I’m a 270 lb out of shape woman and if I can make it all the way to the falls just about anyone can. The water is gorgeous as is the scenery. Start early during the summer, it gets hot fast.",
48,2019-07-20,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",great hike! It was more of a challenge then we were expecting but still not too bad. The last part of the hike is definitely on the steep end. lots of fun and a wonderful waterfall!,
49,2019-07-20,[''],great hike... ,
50,2019-07-18,"['hiking', 'bugs']",,
51,2019-07-15,['hiking'],Great hike but hard. The waterfall is beautiful!,
52,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"This trail is so beautiful! in the first 20 min you can see the lake, and the rest is so pleasant, with shade and some parts next to the river,  but the last 20 or 30 min was really hard for me,  I'm not from here and the altitude was really hard. The waterfall and view is totally worth it. Love it!",
53,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"Great short but strenuous hike.  First portion to the reservoir is quick with about 300-400 feet elevation gain.  Continuing up the trail, the elevation gains slightly to the bridge. There are some rocks on the trail that you have cheap with.  After the bridge, it’s gets really rocky and steep.  The last 2/10ths of the hike is really steep.  Once you get by the fall, the paths down to the fall for a better look are steep and be careful on falling down. Hiking back, watch going down the rocky path.  
Tips:
Bring poles if you aren’t sure of your footing or feel you need extra stability.
There are two trailheads with parking.  Get there early. We started at 7:30 and we got the last parking spot.
After hiking to the falls, we hiked around the reservoir.  It’s a quick half mile or so and for the most part, relatively flat.  Good way to let your legs take a break from the up and down.",
54,2019-07-14,['hiking'],Most of the elevation gain is in the first and last half miles.  Beautiful scenery and the last part to the falls will get your heart pumping.,
55,2019-07-13,['hiking'],Great hike on Thurs night. Perfect weather and the water is rushing high! ,
56,2019-07-11,['hiking'],"Visiting from Alaska and was looking for a few moderate 2-3 hour hikes to go on. This one was perfect - I see it's rated as hard in one spot and moderate in another, but I'd say it's moderate. Yeah, that last bit before the falls was steep, and I was breathing hard (yikes, elevation!), but I thought it was doable. The falls are beautiful and totally worth seeing. The river, trail, and little ground creatures all made it a fun experience. It was the most crowded of the three hikes, but not too bad at all being it was a weekday. I'll do it again next year when I visit. Utah, you are beautiful!",
57,2019-07-10,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Love this trail perfect workout! Got a challenge to get to the falls in 54 min. made in 55. dang it! Anyway  some here say it was vertical the last .25 mile. Nah, not vertical. pretty steep but never need to use hands. I hiked at noon, drank about a liter of water  was about 80f or so. saw lots of big lizards.. the falls are amazing. 
",
58,2019-07-10,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","First time going to the falls on my day off. The first part is nice when you get to the reservoir and pretty mild but the last part of the hike is quiet a climb and gets your HR up there! Went in the middle of the day (mistake) even though there are opportunities for shade with the trees but it gets HOT!!! Make sure you bring LOTS of water. After, you will be greeted with a beautiful waterfall that cools you down! There's a view and a waterfall! Hard but worth it.",
59,2019-07-09,"['hiking', 'rocky']",,
60,2019-07-08,['hiking'],"Hiked this last week and it was great!! Slightly wet in spots but overall wonderful. I’ve personally never sent her waterfall so high with runoff, absolutely worth the hike. ",
61,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'rocky']",,
62,2019-07-07,['hiking'],we started about 8am and the weather was pleasant. loved scrambling up rocks and enjoyed the first waterfall before heading back down.,
63,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"Great hike.  Agree with others from parking lot up, my watch clocked 5.3 miles.  We started at 8am on a Saturday and there were a lot of people and it was warm coming down.  I'd recommend going earlier.  We also had one walking pole each and that seemed like a good balance.  We are relatively new to walking poles but have appreciated them on several hikes.  I also like this is a no dog trail (I'm not anti-dog by any means but sometimes they are a bit too much)",
64,2019-07-05,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","The waterfall is so amazing!! I loved this hike & can’t believe I’ve lived in Utah my whole life and just experienced this hike yesterday. It’s very rocky but I think that’s what made the climb up most enjoyable. I went around 8:30am and it was great, but did get a little hot and coming down there was a lot of people. Was able to cool off by the waterfall. Recommend and reminder to bring lots of water, sunscreen and bug spray. It’s simply beautiful at the top. ",
65,2019-07-02,['hiking'],Great hike.  Waterfall is beautiful with the tall granite peaks providing a gorgeous backdrop.  ,
66,2019-07-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']",First trail I have completed. Saw some turkeys and rabbits about halfway up. The waterfall was cool and the mist coming off of it was refreshing.,
67,2019-07-01,['hiking'],We just hiked this trail two days ago. The distance is actually 5.2 or 5.3 miles if you are counting from the parking lot. The first part of the hike is relatively mild. But get ready for the last half mile to the lower falls. It is basically scrambling up large rocks and very vertical. Poles are helpful (especially coming down) but not necessary. Bring at least 2 liters of water. The payoff is pretty spectacular for your very hard work scrambling up those rocks. The waterfall and river is absolutely roaring right now and a sight to behold. I did see a few mosquitos so you might want to spritz on some bug spray.,
68,2019-07-01,['hiking'],"Trail is a little longer when you include hike from parking lot, uphill to beginning of trail (5.3 miles total. Trail is fairly easy and flat for the first half, then the uphill descent begins and gets gradually harder. The last 1/4 mile is pretty tough, lots of climbing up rocks and high vertical. Waterfall at the top makes it well worth it. Trail is fairly covered on back half towards waterfall, open on the first half. I’m mid 30s and good shape, did entire trail in 2 hours with 10 minute break at waterfall. ",
69,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"Would highly recommend this trail - spectacular river and breathtaking waterfall! Moderately difficult and gets steeper just before the waterfall, but totally worth the effort. Hiking poles useful for the descent. Take a moment at the beautiful meadow - wildflowers in full bloom. ",
70,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"This hike was amazing!!! I don’t hike much and wasn’t sure how I would do, but I did it. The last part is really steep and tiring but the end is so worth is. We stayed at the waterfall for awhile and it was very cool. Go early in the morning when it’s not so hot and bring water!!!",
71,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"This hike was totally worth every step!! Went all the way up to the waterfall. Took about 2 hours and 45 minutes, stopped a couple times to breathe and check out the scenery. By far my most favorite hike this year. ❤️",
72,2019-06-29,['hiking'],6AM start was cool and the people were sparse. The lower Falls are amazin...with a dramatic cascade putting plenty of mist in the air. (met  a guy on the trail from the upper Falls...said they're twice the size but another .75 miles further up).  Didn't have time this trip...about 2hrs up and back if you jog a bit and don't hang out too long at the Falls. Well worth the time & effort... ,
73,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","Great hike! Relatively easy until the last .6 miles, then it’s a leg burner. Waterfall at the “top” is a great reward. Lots of people when we went at 7:30. #worthit",
74,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Fun hike with beautiful views, especially right now with the water raging.

My advice, being some mosquito spray.  Once you get to the falls, they are everywhere!",
75,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"This was definitely a hike worth taking. It’s quite steep though. 
*A few tips: bring tons of water if it’s warm out. I had a full bottle of vitamin water and a bottle of water and it wasn’t enough. 
*If you’re going up to the falls, bring an extra shirt or something you can sit on. Many rocks to sit on at the falls are wet. I just sat on my backpack and relaxed as the waterfall’s mist cooled me down. It’s super beautiful & relaxing. 
*Bring a walking stick!!!!!! I’m only in my 30s, but I have had 2 knee surgeries, a spinal surgery last year, and have had MS for 11 years. If I didn’t have the walking stick I would have been screwed as my legs went quite weak toward the end. I powered through, but if you have similar health concerns just make sure you go well prepared. I also brought Aleve, which helped after I popped two at the falls before heading back. If I do this hike again I would 100% bring a fan or cool pack to help keep my body temp down. That would have helped the legs.
*Keep your eyes out for fun critters. I saw lizards, pretty caterpillars, and a rattlesnake!! 
*The only down side were the 5 different people/groups I passed who had a music player in their backpacks bumping dumb music. Seriously people, some come to the mountains to get away and enjoy nature - it’s rude to bump music, especially crappy music, on the trail. Use headphones. 
Overall, a great, but challenging hike. Have fun!! ",
76,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Great hike. Trail is in good shape. Fair amount of bugs near the waterfall, so bring repellant. We left about 6pm. It was hot, but it was an enjoyable hike. ",
77,2019-06-28,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","We hiked this last weekend with our kids 6-10. It was their first hard hike, and they did great! With minimal complaining. At least one of them really enjoyed scrambling up the rocks. Bring plenty to drink, and recommend pack a picnic to enjoy at the falls. It's a steep climb to the  waterfalls, but worth it. Overall hike took us 3-3.5 hours.",
78,2019-06-27,['hiking'],Are you kidding me??? I have lived in Utah my whole life and have never done this before! This hike was INCREDIBLE!! Hands down my new favorite hike. There were some super steep points...but the waterfall at the top is so worth the climb. I was in shock with how big the falls were and how gorgeous they were! It was so refreshing sitting by the falls and taking in the views. I highly recommend this hike! I will definitely be back on this trail very soon! ,
79,2019-06-26,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Great place to go hiking and enjoy the nature,
80,2019-06-24,['hiking'],Absolutely of the charts amazing hike. The first waterfall blew me away on how large it was.  A must do hike.,
81,2019-06-24,['hiking'],Great trail! The waterfall was amazing. ,
82,2019-06-24,['hiking'],My girlfriend and I went all the way up to the first and second falls. Right after the second falls the trail becomes very overgrown and you start to see snow. Very steep. Worth the effort. Views are great as well! ,

102,2019-06-11,['hiking'],Loved this hike!!!,
103,2019-06-11,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']","Great hike, worth the tiring final mile! You can cool off from the mist of the raging waterfall and look out to a gorgeous valley view.  The end is at a steep incline but it’s definitely doable. Trail is clear. There is a very short section where you have to cross over shallow water but you can cross on rocks to avoid getting wet, also a little mud at the very top but not deep. I recommend taking this trail early in the morning or late in the evening. I started at 5 pm and was very hot all the way through given there wasn’t much shade coverage on any stretch of the trail. Bring lots of water!! ",
104,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Absolutely gorgeous waterfall!!  The hike starts off with a bit of an incline then levels off around the reservoir before it climbs again before the waterfall.   This year the waterfall is RAGING... with that,  be careful it gets muddy and slippery the closest to the falls you get.",
105,2019-06-09,['hiking'],"Great hike with fun. First half mile was little hard and then  you can reach out to the lake. Spent some time at lake, last 1/2 mile was steep and hard. Water fall was an awesome views and best scenic place.",
106,2019-06-09,[''],"first 3/4 mile is an incline, then switchbacks, then  incline. The ast 1/2 mile your incline is brought to you by a  stairmaster on steroids. Bring poles and arrive early. very busy trail.",
107,2019-06-08,[''],Had a great time with my wife hiking this trail. It's a moderate trail in my opinion. Gotta use your tactical sense this time of year on the descent but not bad going up. I would recommend using hiking boots regardless for traction. Beautiful waterfall once you reach the top!,
108,2019-06-07,['hiking'],A little muddy but not terrible. We were hiking in a small stream for quite a bit of it. But really fun. We went to the upper falls and clocked about 6.6 miles with a 2500 ft elevation gain. Beautiful sheer granite rock walls at the top. ,
109,2019-06-06,[''],Great hike! Last mile was a bit slippery due to recent rains coupled with snow melt so choose your footwear wisely. Spend some time at the top and soak in the valley and waterfall views! ,
110,2019-06-06,[''],Off the charts with all the run off. last half a mile of the trail is a creek. Continued on the trail to find the upper waterfall but didn't make it due to running out of daylight. Each time I do this trail it has something new to offer. ,
111,2019-06-06,['hiking'],The trail is pretty much dry. Beautiful views. One of my favorite hikes. ,
112,2019-06-04,['hiking'],Amazing,
113,2019-06-04,[''],To reach the waterfall a beauty. It has a little inclination but it is achieved.,

207,2018-09-22,[''],"Great trail if you’re looking for an intense exercise going up some really rocky and dirt trails. It consists of going up the initial peak from the trailhead, which leads to a path surrounding a small, dried-up lake. My friend and I went left from there, where we hit a few side-trails that went further into the forest (probably to get closer to the lake), up to where we find a sign that marked where the waterfall trail actually begins.

From that sign, we ascended upwards through some forest that offered some scenic water/stream views, and after much progress, the trail becomes extremely rocky and treacherous. Be sure to take many breaks and bring tons of water. Eventually you’ll make it high enough where the trail veers to the side, where you’ll have to traverse both dirt and rock to make it to the actual waterfall.

Thankfully the trail isn’t too bad going down, but be very careful of your footing because it’s easy to slip when stepping on loose dirt and gravel.

All in all, good trail, but I would only come back for the sidetrails and wildlife instead of going all the way back to the waterfall.",

Make sure you have good griped shoes and PLENY of water! Definitely depending on the time of year you do it of course! I did it for the last time last year 8months pregnant and then again this year for the first time 8months out! LOVE IT!",

Lake is a great stop for photos. 
Saw one rattlesnake.",

After the reservoir it gets more challenging. the trails aren't marked too well. the last .3 miles are very steep, but really fun and challenging to climb. The falls are amazing and well worth it. There is a large Boulder shelf that you can stand on and take a picture of the valley as well.  I would recommend going in the morning,  about 7, traffic is very light and usually faster more athletic people are there. It was really busy around 930 is with novice hikers",
238,2018-07-31,['hiking'],The view is definitely worth the last mile uphill. Just make sure to wear decent shoes and go when it's not 97 degrees out like I did. Pretty tough hike but that waterfall at the end is magnificent,

241,2018-07-28,['hiking'],This hike is always a challenge for me but I love it. Third time now bc I feel safe hiking it solo. It’s definitely warming up as Summer goes on but luckily the crowds are thinning (so it’s not super packed). My goal is to make it without stopping but that last half mile is brutal.,

There were the just out for a stroll variety and then the hard core this is my work out variety.    For the easy stroll just walk up to the resevoir.   For the more serious ones go on up to the waterfall.   Note:  there were plenty of signs warning about the dangers associated with the waterfall; also a law enforcement officer we chatted with on our way  up said they usually ""lose about one a year"".   Having said that, the waterfall fell into the category ""probably  safe if you don't do stupid things"".   Good hike and viewing the map it looks like there's another lake a little further up from the water fall.   Will probably do that one next.",

The temps were right around 100 in early July, so bring plenty of water. Steep steps and large rocks are prevalent for much of the hike, but the waterfall is a beautiful destination. The upper portion is even steeper than the lower, but it’s worth the wobbly legs you’ll have at the end of the hike!",

258,2018-07-09,[''],The trail is beautiful. It is difficult but the waterfalls are awsome. Really enjoyed this beautiful trail. Should take plenty of water as during hiking you will not find drinking water.,

267,2018-07-01,[''],"4 stars because the trail to the reservoir isn't very fun. However everything after that is so beautiful and the end result is wonderful. Take time at the end to explore above the waterfall. There are pretty pools and other beautiful water features. The last probably 1/3 of a mile is very steep, but it is nice and shaded.",

Great hike and good leg workout the last 1/5 mile up to the falls. The second 1/2 of the trail was well covered and protection from the mid-day sun. A lot of water coming over the falls made a good sight as well as cooling mist. Overall, highly recommend it.
***NOTE: There were a good number of other hikers on the trail but there were enough with poor etiquette that took away from the enjoyment of many: 1) don't play your music - especially at high volume so we can hear you 100 yards away, 2) leave no trace (don't carve names, don't drop your trash...), 3) descending hikers have the right of way",

Last mile or so is almost completely uphill, with the final stretch VERY steep and rocky. It's definitely a workout, but well worth it. I hiked this with my 10 and 12 year old sister and brother, and they did great. Waterfall and views are gorgeous. We hiked Saturday from 1-5 pm and there were definitely others on the trail but not enough to cause inconvenience to our hike or anything.",

How about you respect it and see it for what it truly is.",
274,2018-06-18,['hiking'],This hike was gorgeous!  We started at about 7pm from the Bells Canyon Granite Trailhead and it took until about 8:30 to get to the Lower Falls.  Didn't stay long there because we only had another 30 minutes of daylight.  Got back to trailhead at about 9:45 though when you head back down you're still in the direction of the light.  Definitely recommend a hat for non-shady parts as well as bug repellant.  A hiking pole is helpful but not completely necessary.  Great workout and definitely worth it.  Also NO DOGS allowed on this trail.,
275,2018-06-18,[''],This hike was jaw droppingly gorgeous. I couldn't believe how big the payoff was to get to the top. Make sure to take your time and explore the different paths at the beginning, almost all of them lead to the top.

277,2018-06-16,[''],The first part of the hike has no shade so make sure you have lots of water. Once you pass the small lake it really gets pretty. Great views and fun family hike.,

279,2018-06-16,['hiking'],Great varied trail. starts of on sandy trail through bushes with marveloud Valley Views until you meet the pretty lake. Continues through rather dry vegetation until you hit the stream leading up over steep rocky trail to teh waterfall. Great trail. almost stepped on rattle snake. We measured a bit over 6 miles and could not find any trail info how muh farther up for second fall and lake,
280,2018-06-15,[''],My go-to hike. Great workout and a beautiful trail running adjacent to a strong stream.  Enjoy the mist of the falls at the top and some cool shade.,
281,2018-06-13,['hiking'],Initial ascent is a workout, so is the last half mile climb to the falls that could get technical in some spots. In between is easy so you can sandwich a run here if you're into that. Start early to avoid crowds and allow about 4 hours for the round trip and gawking time.
282,2018-06-13,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail! I just moved to the area from Cache Valley and have heard all about the hiking, that view definitely did not disappoint!! Saw a medium sized rattler just past the lake, don’t forget to be aware! Also, take your garbage with you.. was saddened to see garbage along the trail.",
283,2018-06-11,['hiking'],"nice hike, most of the beginning park is sandy with only a slight increase then it gets a bit steeper and more rocky. we logged it at 5 mi or just slightly over to get right up to the water fall. View at the end is definitely worth it. Can get pretty crowded, lots of tourists. It was rather cool the day we went and bugs/flies weren't an issue at all.",
284,2018-06-07,['hiking'],"I don't hike as often, but after seeing the beautiful view in the end, I will definitely do it again! I went with my friend who has asthma and new to hiking.

We finished it with 4 hours which we spent the most at the top steep/rocky part.
Bring lots of water with you and sunscreen lol. One annoying part was the flies! Bring bugs repellent if you plan to go.",

286,2018-06-06,[''],"Great trail with great scenery ranging from streams, a lake, meadows, forest, and a beautiful rushing waterfall at the end. Terrific views of the valley and mountains throughout. We sure don't have this back in the midwest where I'm from!",

293,2018-05-28,[''],"It has great view points but since it’s so well known, it was packed with families and teens playing loud music. We had to stop several times to let groups pass... If you are a professional and want a quiet hike that is still challenging, don’t go here, unless it’s before the sun rise and crowds.",
294,2018-05-28,[''],Ran down this trail after making it to the lower falls.  Superb hike and technical run down over boulders and smooth runs.  Definitely a gem along the wasatch front.,

I was planning on 4.4, but somehow ended up with 6 miles round trip. I’m not sure if there’s an entrance that I missed at a different spot. Six miles made it quite long, and we had kids with us. We got so far committed, we couldn’t turn back, but t proved to be difficult with young ones.
Definitely worth it!!",
301,2018-05-24,['hiking'],"Bells Canyon Trail was my first ever hike in Utah, first mountain land and VERY FIRST WATERFALL!! The views are good at first but there are houses just a few hundred yards away. However, they get more and more amazing as you pass the lake and the stream. Once you get closer to the falls the hike becomes pretty steep but it’s worth it. Amazing place all around.",
302,2018-05-24,[''],"From the start of the South trailhead near Pepperwood, our distance totalled JUST UNDER 6 MILES ROUNDTRIP, definitely not 4.4...though I see the map to this uses the other trail start... Just be aware! We do this hike about once a year and love it. VERY clean (good job picking up your trash, everyone!) 
Its basically the kitchen sink of hikes...steep stepping, nice smooth forest trail, some safe scrambling, scrub oak, pine forest, desert, shaded creekside trail, bridges, a fun reservoir, beautiful wildflowers, AND OF COURSE THE GORGEOUS WATERFALL! We did this with my brother and sister in law with our combined 5 kids. Our 3 year olds were very very slow and had multiple meltdowns, but we made it...in about 6 miserable hours, but that view is SO worth it! We hike very often, though, and I'm not sure I would recommend this to other familes with young kids, unless you're ready to help carry them! For most, the reservoir is a great destination with plenty of accomplishment.",
303,2018-05-21,['hiking'],"Fun, quick, and fairly easy hike.  Lots of shade but I’d still recommend bringing sunscreen.  The cold water from the river makes it cooler as well.  Parking is a little bit limited so going earlier in the morning or on a Sunday allows you to avoid the crowds which can limit your pace both up and down the hike.  All around a great hike to get your legs burning and help work up to bigger trails like Mount Olympus or Ben Lomond.",
304,2018-05-21,['hiking'],"Views are gorgeous. The last quarter mile to the falls is an absolute booty burner, but it’s definitely worth it once you get to the top. Fair amount of rocks. I would recommend shoes with decent traction and support.",

Last bit was steep and I had to stop a few times to catch my breath but once you make it past there and you start getting closer to the falls it gets much easier and cooler temperature wise. Definitely worth pushing through the hard part. Plenty to look at once you get there.,

It’s pretty steep and a few stretches required some boulder climbing. At 50 something, I was glad to have my poles to take some stress off my knees.  The Falls are spectacular and there were several groups of hikers soaking up the scenery and stopping for lunch.",

We didn’t have our trekking poles which might have helped, but we made it. Very rocky and steep as you get near the falls so be prepared to work, but the payoff was amazing. Not huge crowds on a weekday late morning, but I suspect that changes on weekends.",

I brought a book and coffee and stayed for several hours. Highly recommend it!",
323,2018-04-28,['hiking'],Beautiful trail! My 9 & 11 yr olds made the hike with me and my recording said it was 6 Miles roundtrip from the south parking lot.

We were forced to turn back about a half mile before the falls because the ice was too  slick for my 5 year old to safely climb. we slipped and fell several times coming down, but overall it was awesome. We did this last year when my son was 4, and he made it to the top without any problems, so I wouldn't consider this as rated hard. It is a steady incline all the way up, but it's not bad.",
342,2018-02-04,['hiking'],"I was shocked at how big the waterfall was this week.  Fabulous!  If you want to actually get a good view of the waterfall (not recommended for those with kids or carrying kids) make sure you have hiking sticks, and a good treads on shoes that your ok if they get muddy.  If you take it slow, use the 4 point system, and watch for the large switchback that heads west, you will get down to the bottom where there is a really amazing view of the water all without trees blocking your view.

My friend and I both loved it.  We were so glad we had our spikes on and our poles in hand-trail was quite icy.  Scenery changed frequently. Trail was pretty easy to follow.

A little early for fall foliage but what fall colors there were were beautiful! We went late afternoon and wandered around the reservoir before having a snack up at the falls.

The rest of the hike up to the falls was relatively easy until about the last half mile where it gets steep and feels like it never ends. At one point I wondered if seeing the falls was even worth it. Once I got up there, it was.

472,2017-05-22,['hiking'],"I hiked this trail with my 9 pound dog, I was nervous that he wouldn't be able to get up the rocks, but he could. There were a few points going down that I was nervous for him, so I helped him. The trail was well maintained, the people I passed were all kind. We went up just past the reservoir, then turned around. It was just under two miles. I would have gone further, but this was my dogs first hike and I didn't want to push it. All in all, it was great. I will most definitely be taking him here again.",
473,2017-05-22,['hiking'],The hike was beautiful but I didn't think the falls were beautiful enough to be worth it. Strenuous not dangerous.,
474,2017-05-20,['hiking'],Step at the end.,
475,2017-05-20,['hiking'],"Trailhead to the lower reservoir is a nice easy hike and is a good warmup for the second leg. Once you pass the lower reservoir, the fun begins. This trail has an excellent mature of all terrains and following the water flow upstream means there is always something to look at. The last leg of the trail is a pretty difficult climb; large rocks and a steeper grade. But it is so worth it when the reward is the waterfall at the end. Experienced and equipped hiker recommended. Don't do this in your tennis shoes (I've done it, sure, but the decent was less than fun)",
476,2017-05-20,[''],love it! it's why I started to love hiking!,
477,2017-05-20,['hiking'],"GORGEOUS! The trees up to the falls make a nice tunnel and it's seriously beautiful! Don't let the ""scramble"" scare you, it's really not a hard hike. Took less than 3 hrs and I stopped every two seconds to take pictures.",
478,2017-05-17,[''],The waterfall is majestic and the large open area at the top of the hike is ideal for yoga or a picnic.,
479,2017-05-16,[''],"This is a great and challenging hike! I never made it to the falls because we brought our 5 & 3 year old up not knowing any better, and my 3 year old hit a wall by the time we reached the part where you cross the run off. My 5 year made it, but had a melt down close to the bottom on the way down. This hike is more appropriate for kids 8+. The water is raging right now, so it's a great time to take this hike. There is a pretty steep and long hike up rocks and boulders at the end.",
480,2017-05-16,['hiking'],"Hiked/trail-ran this trail up to the waterfall. As others report, there is some mud near the end of the final stair/ascent due to run-off from the little creek near that you have to cross at the top. Also, after crossing the creek and just before hitting the falls, there is a larger area of mud; however, it can be avoided by skirting the edge. Falls were fantastic to look at and hear. Scrambling down the trees and rocks next to the falls leads to some great views of the valley.",
481,2017-05-15,[''],"The falls are raging right now! Beautiful!  A little muddy at the top. We also saw a few dogs on the trail and at the falls, including an unleashed dog that did his business in the middle of the trail and the owners left it. This is a watershed and there are plenty of signs at the beginning of the trail that state no dogs. I have 3 of my own, I obey the rules. Take them to Mill creek canyon where they are allowed.",
482,2017-05-14,['hiking'],This hike was a littler harder than anticipated. There was a section with a constant incline of rocks to climb that was pretty tough but it was well worth it once you get to the waterfall!  I personally would not take children under 10 or so.,
483,2017-05-14,['hiking'],Love this hike! Took about 3 hours including a few stops along the way & spending about a half hour to hang out at the falls.,
484,2017-05-14,[''],Gorgeous hike. Took us about 3 hours with stops and pictures.,
485,2017-05-14,['hiking'],Hiked up to the falls on May 13th the trail was very dry until the last half mile. The runoff from the snow is coming down the steep rock scramble making it very muddy. The falls are roaring! The spray from the falls is making the steep eroded slope very muddy. Sure would be nice if there was a single path there that everyone took to prevent the massive amount of erosion going on. Despite it being a no dogs allowed trail I saw two dogs running free on the trail. I will say this when you see .07 miles to the falls I'm calling BS that was the longest .07 miles I've ever done.,
486,2017-05-13,['hiking'],"Great hike! Beautiful scenery but muddy at the top so come prepared. Our group agrees that it's moderate in terms of difficulty, so don't be scared off by the ""hard"" rating. Took us 3 hours total with breaks and photos.",
487,2017-05-13,[''],"First time and it was spectacular! Falls were roaring and high water runoff. Not sure this is a hike for ""experienced"" hikers only- there were families with littles doing this today. Not easy but certainly doable for semi-casual hikers.",
488,2017-05-13,[''],A little chilly with the mist off the falls but amazing!,
489,2017-05-12,['hiking'],The Falls are roaring right now! The trail is mostly dry but there is a bit of stream run over toward the top right before getting to the 'big tree'. Still easily crossable. Muddy below the Falls so use caution. Stunning right now - go do this hike!,
490,2017-05-07,['hiking'],"Strenuous but worth it! There are a couple of different trail paths that could easily get you lost if you've never done this before and no one is in front of you to follow. There are only a couple of signs. So here's the turns as soon as you hit the lake: left, left, left, right. And then straight to the falls! Took me 2.5 hours with only a couple of rests, then 1 hr coming down. It is beautiful!",
491,2017-05-06,[''],"One of my favorite hikes! Beautiful views, nice foliage and water sources along the way to the waterfall. Plus it's a good workout.",
492,2017-05-06,['hiking'],"This hike has it all- beautiful lake, pretty trail, mountain views, pine trees, river and gorgeous waterfall. Loved this hike!!",
493,2017-05-06,[''],Great hike!! Beautiful views...well worth the steep rocky stretch right before the waterfall.!,
494,2017-05-02,[''],"Great hike, the last bit of trail is very icy and slick from the snow be mindful of it. Wear shoes with good traction, my friend kept slipping and falling because he had no traction in the snow.",
495,2017-05-01,[''],"I tried it with 3 kids (wearing one, 2 bigger ones walking) as other parents said they made it. We got to the ""waterfall"" sign, but I became a nervous nelly and called it right in the homestretch. We'll try again when the snow is melted! But I loved listening to the water for most of the hike, and we packed out in late afternoon and saw pheasant, deer, a snack mooching  squirrel, and heard wild turkey. Beautiful scenery!",
496,2017-04-30,['hiking'],Nice hike and beautiful Falls. It was pretty muddy with patches of snow and very icy around the Falls. I want to come back in a few weeks to see more greenery and bring my kids. Almost made it to the Upper Falls but I didn't have the right shoes for the snow.  Next time!,
497,2017-04-29,['hiking'],,
498,2017-04-24,['hiking'],"I loved everything about this hike except the crowds, but then, that is probably why it was crowded on a Sunday afternoon.  The trail is well maintained, the climb is moderate up until the last quarter mile when it gets strenuous.  There was a patch of snow on a fairly steep part that was difficult to traverse.  A couple of my kids slipped in that section.  But the creek crossing at the top of the climb was not a problem at all.",
499,2017-04-24,['hiking'],I love this trail. Moderately difficult with spectacular views that are worth the steep climb. I went yesterday and there was only one patch of snow/ice about 20 feet long. No big deal.,
500,2017-04-22,[''],Worth the steepness towards the end! Only a very small stretch of snow-- no micro spikes needed just be cautious,
501,2017-04-21,['hiking'],little tough on the little ones but they made it.,
502,2017-04-21,[''],Gorgeous hike! Definitely gets a little tough towards the top but definitely do-able and totally worth the views! Went yesterday and only had to to deal with like 10 yards of snow.,
503,2017-04-19,[''],"This trail is great. Some random trails off of it that make it kinda confusing, but just follow the rocky part of the trail and you're good. Also be careful on the waterfall, rocks are slick. Super steep at the end but so so worth it.",
504,2017-04-17,[''],"A great hike. The trail is well used even during the winter months. not nearly as beautiful in the winter since the falls aren't flowing, bit still a nice hike.  Bring a garbage bag with you to slide back down the trail and then pick up the trash that is left by the horde who visit the reservoir",
505,2017-04-16,['hiking'],Beautiful trail! The last hike up is a good one with lots of boulders and rocks to climb but the view is more than worth it!!,
506,2017-04-16,['hiking'],"The foliage is just starting to fill in, and the waterfall is growing (not quite peak flow yet). The trail is dry for the most part (there's a 100 foot stretch of packed snow on an incline that you'll need to pass; bring yaktrax, or a sense of humor; after that its dry to the falls).",
507,2017-04-16,[''],I need to go there again..,
508,2017-04-16,[''],The waterfall is absolutely beautiful but parts of the trail are a little confusing as there are several lead offs. The last bit is quite difficult and snow is still present at the top. Overall a great hike.,
509,2017-04-16,[''],"The falls are so beautiful and completely worth the climb. There was some slushy snow on the trail near the top, but it wasn't bad.",
510,2017-04-16,['hiking'],"Amazing trail, really hard and challenging!!!",
511,2017-04-16,[''],Great Hike. Steep at the end. Worth seeing waterfalls.,
512,2017-04-15,[''],"Great hike, even though it's rated hard it is doable. People do this one all year round, we did it in 2 feet of snow once.",
513,2017-04-12,['hiking'],"Great hike, still a bunch of snow at the top, but totally doable. Not a lot of people on the trail",
514,2017-04-07,['hiking'],Hiked it with my 3 year old. Was a little steep and we had some help down but it was very fun!,
515,2017-04-06,['hiking'],Excellent hike. Great way to get the season started. Lots of leg work towards the end.. but well worth it. Only about 50 feet of the trail was snow covered.,
516,2017-04-06,['hiking'],The trail was very pretty and the waterfall was great. There are a lot of rocks on the trail and still some parts with snow when you get close to the top. It's scenic and we did not encounter very many people.,
517,2017-04-05,['walking'],"Did it during winter:

poorly signed, use your app to follow trial.

road is rocky, easy to roll ankle if not careful.  ice near top, ice spikes would be super helpful, but doable with regular shoes, just go slow.  

fall is no Yosemite,  but still nice.",
518,2017-04-01,[''],Almost no snow left. Just a little at the top!! Such a beautiful waterfall. Well worth the hike,
519,2017-03-29,[''],Really good exercise. There's a lot of ice on the last quarter-mile to the waterfall. Really slippery.,
520,2017-03-26,['hiking'],"Hike to falls was great this morning with snow/ice on the last 1/4 mile (on the climb).  A bit muddy in places due to the 2.5"" of rain over the past 3 days.  Water over the falls was spectacular",
521,2017-03-22,[''],I just did this trail yesterday and it was pretty dry except when you got toward the top. there was a little bit of ice toward the top. The Falls look amazing! I am a 56 year old in fairly good shape and this is a little bit challenging but doable.,

523,2017-03-20,[''],Great hike. Be prepared for some snow towards the top in the spring.,
524,2017-03-16,['hiking'],Awsome hike,
525,2017-03-15,[''],"it's an amazing hike! I did it during March 11, there was snow near the top, I wasn't able to make it because my lazy sister and her lazy friend didn't want to go up the steeper area, the area was full of snow at the time, my favorite part was running down and sliding!",
526,2017-03-12,['hiking'],Love this hike! One of my favorites especially the large waterfall. Today was very dry in the beginning but throughout the trail is a fair amount of snow and slush. At the waterfall there was not alot of snow surprisingly. Would advise wearing spikes on your shoes.,
527,2017-03-11,[''],Great day to hike. Still some snow and mud puddles left from the colder days. Trail starts off with some killer switch backs and increases elevation drastically. Loved it!,
528,2017-02-26,[''],I did this today. It was all packed snow the whole time. I had no crampons and slipping was a concern in steep parts. I fell about 4 or 5 times in the final descent to the waterfall. I decided not to go all the way down to the base of the waterfall because I wasn't sure if I could make it back up.,
529,2017-02-22,['hiking'],"Just did this yesterday. It was ICCCCCCYYYYYY. Please be careful. Im an experienced hiker, and busted my BUTT and have a large abrasion on my butt because of it (tore my leggings etc.) This is one of my all time favorite hikes in the area, when its not snowy. If you're doing this one this time of year PLEASE bring spikes/crampons/snow trax for grip. Also, since all trails can NEVER get anything right, we mapped it with our GPS device. It is exactly 5.4 miles RT from the Granite Trailhead.",
530,2017-02-18,['snowshoeing'],Trail is slightly muddy with patches is snow and ice above the lower reservoir. Packed Snow up to the lower Falls so chains are helpful in the steep sections. The snow is deep enough above the Falls that snowshoes are helpful to avoid the occasional post holing. Beautiful in the winter and uncrowned first thing in the morning.,
531,2017-02-18,['hiking'],Beautiful any time of year. Love this hike.,
532,2017-02-06,[''],This hike never gets old. It's as beautiful in the summer as it is in the winter,
533,2017-02-05,['hiking'],"I do this hike at least once a year, definitely a Utah staple. It gets steep in some parts but nothing unmanageable.",
534,2017-01-15,['hiking'],"1st time on this trail in winter, fun stuff! Snow is very packed down on Granite trail and pretty icy up to reservoir, glad I had poles and slip-on spikes/crampons(OUTAD brand on AMAZON only $25, soooo worth it). The closer you get to the waterfall the more beautiful the surroundings, but the more steep and slick so be careful!",
535,2017-01-14,[''],"Great hike, well used. The snow was packed so I didn't have to use my snow shoes. A little bit slippery. I would recommend using a par of the hiking cleats to give you better traction.",
536,2017-01-02,['hiking'],"Takes a quick 20-45 to get to the reservoir. From there you can access dozens of trails or head up to the waterfall. I've hiked it over 50 times this year and still have so much to explore. It isn't too deep in the canyon so the conditions aren't brutal. 
It is a quick getaway for me even in my busiest of days.",
537,2016-12-17,['hiking'],,
538,2016-11-15,['hiking'],"This is a popular hike with a well groomed trail. And although the last quarter mile is steep (as depicted on the elevation map) the rest of the hike is moderate at best and to be honest not that interesting. Admittedly the falls and the canyon are quite beautiful. If you continue past the falls, the trail will end in a nice overlook. That said, with all of Utah's beautiful trails, this is not a hike I'd recommend.",
539,2016-11-13,[''],"I love this hike! It's a fairly moderate elevation gain until the very end it picks up a bit and there's a long stretch of bouldering rocks up hill.  Once you gain the elevation to the water fall, there's a bit of technical hiking to get down to the water fall so just be careful there if it's Icey or wet.  But the pay off is worth it, very rewarding views of Salt Lake City as well as the lower waterfall it's self is beautiful.
Several places along the way to use a life straw or water purifier as well.",
540,2016-11-07,[''],It is not for the beginner weak of heart. Pretty steep with a few spots that level off. Beautiful aspen trees and a little reservoir a little from the trailhead. Very steep close to the end of the trail where the falls are at. Worth the hike!,
541,2016-11-05,[''],Great trail!  Hiked in the rain and trail was just fine.,
542,2016-10-30,['hiking'],"if you love rocky trails that stretch your ankles , this is a fun one. the last quarter mile to the falls can kick your butt and watch your footing as it's a little slick. if you feel safe about scrambling up past the falls on the right hand side and crossing over them at the top, there are some incredible views with mountains on each side and the valley below , I was even able to lay down and catch some rays!",
543,2016-10-16,[''],"Hard. Rocky have good shoes, water, energy. Not marked ask other hikers how to get to the waterfall. If not you will just keep climbing.",
544,2016-10-15,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful, challenging hike. Not sure I would do it again all the way to the falls, though. The last third of a mile is a climb up a field of boulders and then to get a decent view of the falls, you have to descend a short, steep hill with loose dirt. I recommend bringing plenty of water and snacks and wearing good boots and using trekking poles for the descent. This hike is on the harder end of moderate if you're in reasonably good shape.",
545,2016-10-14,['hiking'],"Little challenging in the second half of the trail. Beautiful falls, would definitely do this trail again.",
546,2016-10-13,['hiking'],it was a nice moderate hike.  it gets a bit rocky when you get closers to the falls. really beautiful fall colors.,

548,2016-10-01,[''],"Great hike.  Only the last quarter mile or so to the falls is hard, and even then. not that bad if you slow down a little. If you're in reasonably good shape, it should be no trouble for you.",
549,2016-09-28,['hiking'],"This was an amazing hike!  The below reviews do not lie.  The first and last half miles are steep and rocky.  Being from Florida, the altitude made it hard for me.  But in the end, the falls and the view of the valley were worth the hike.  It took me right at 2 hours to make it to the falls.  The return trip was a little faster because it was all downhill!  Would definitely do this again when I come back!",

556,2016-09-12,[''],"This hike is amazing!! No matter what time of year you go it is always beautiful. It's very steep but once you've done it once it becomes more doable. The first waterfall is the main attraction, but there is another waterfall about a half an hour after the first one that is less visited and beautiful as well.",
557,2016-09-11,['hiking'],Beautiful and fun hike.,

566,2016-08-29,['trail running'],First visit and ran it to the waterfall. Miles 1 & 2 were fairly easy and times were 15-16 min per mile. Mile 3 that number went to 23 min a mile. Gorgeous payoff at the top though!,
567,2016-08-28,[''],Not a bad trail. Lake is kinda dry right now. Still fun though.,
568,2016-08-27,[''],"Perfect day for it in late August. Due to a half marathon, the parking lot was empty which is rare on a Saturday. The falls were amazing but super steep and rocky to get to.",
569,2016-08-25,['hiking'],"such a beautiful hike! we at first thought everyone was crazy for saying it was hard but the last mile or so was really steep and full of boulders. that was the part that almost killed me, but everyone else was fine. not too crowded for a weekday, just crowded enough to know you're going in the right direction. but the trails are narrow so making room was difficult. plan to stay and admire all the views you pass. :)",

The hike to the reservoir is very easy and so is the beginning part to the falls, but then it gets fairly steep and rocky. The turn off for the lower falls can be easily missed, so be sure you know where you are going. I would also recommend going early as this is a VERY busy trail.",
578,2016-07-30,[''],"We love this hike. Super easy, yet still a hike. The lake is beautiful. You can feed the ducks, or jog around it. You can also continue on to the falls if you want.",
579,2016-07-29,['hiking'],One of my favorite trails. It is pretty intense towards the falls but very much worth all the road rash,
580,2016-07-25,[''],"Parking lot is minimal off a busy road. The portion to the lake/reservoir is fairly easy but no shade. Very hot. Sunscreen and water a must. Watch for snakes! Luckily noticed a rattlesnake today that crossed our path. We yielded and also gave warning to a family coming in the opposite direction. No big deal just keep an eye out. 
From the lake, bear left as there's not much for directions (follow gps) in fact the actual trail to waterfall is a small path with a sign in the opposite direction. Luckily we were headed in the same direction as other hikers and they offered guidance and few laughs. The trail up to the river is easy but tight and a bit overgrown in some spots. After crossing the river it's gets rocky, very rocky. The last 20-30min are also very steep. Views are beautiful and the waterfall was very pretty. But this is not an easy trail. Proof is every person you see as you descend back down, has this look of defeat asking how much further up the waterfall. We did on the way up.lol. Nice people all along the way For sure. An experienced hiker would enjoy this.",

582,2016-07-17,[''],"Absolutely my favorite hike by far in Utah so far. I have been on many too. The only difficulty, aside from it being steep, is finding the falls. Stay along the creek once you hit the rocks going up and then when you get to the old tree and the creek, take a hard left. If this doesn't work for you, use the maps on this app, you'll find it. And it's absolutely worth it. Wow, there aren't enough words to describe who breathtaking this hike is. Definitely worth the difficulty.",

586,2016-07-08,[''],Challenging hike with great views.,
587,2016-07-03,['hiking'],Great trail! Definitely going to do it again. Totally worth going to the upper falls. Took my 8 year old adventurous son and he did awesome not sure if I would take anyone younger to the falls unless they are awesome little hikers.,
588,2016-06-30,['hiking'],Amazing. Waterfall was awesome and so was the view. That was easy not hard.,
589,2016-06-29,[''],This trail is extremely rocky past the river. Make sure to bring the right shoes! Also it is easy to wander off the main path as there are very few markings. Keep an eye on the GPS. Great work out for an individual at a moderate level of fitness.,
590,2016-06-27,['hiking'],"Tip: Check your map GPS often as me and my friend got lost and had to back track half an hour. Another couple of friends did it the next week and they had to back track 2 hours for following the wrong trail. It's poorly marked and there are hundreds of little trails branching off to nowhere.

Note: This is a very confusing, poorly marked trail! There are many large, seemingly legitimate trails leading in different directions. We seemed to choose the right one as long as we stayed heading UP rather than left or right. We got to the falls and only even took the right path because we got tipped from another hiker. At the end, the trail will get very steeps and you will have to cross a stream. After that, follow the trail to the LEFT rather than continuing up the REALLY steep trail that continues up. This will take you to straight to the lower falls. 

There was a lot of tree cover, and much of the trail was basically rock climbing (there were so many rocks!) Bring good shoes and prepare for a fun time coming back! It took us what seemed like 30 minutes to come down the trail while it took us 2 hours up (it may have been an hour down, but it flew!)",

You're missing out if you don't continue. My only complaint about this trail is how crazy crowded the parking lot is....and how crowded the lower part is due to the reservoir.,
665,2015-12-30,[''],"Excellent hike in the snow. Trail was nice and smooth as a few hikers had blazed the trail. Can be very icy in some
spots, good microspikes are needed. Borderline treacherous if you're not careful. Waterproof hiking boots and trekking poles helpful as well.

The lower reservoir is quite easy to get to, 30-45 minutes. turn left and look for The Bells Canyon trail sign, this leads to The lower falls. they can be easy to miss. look for a large line tree and set trail. The tee has a large ""WF"" carved into the bark. The lower falls are the best sight in my opinion, not counting the incredible views. this hike is steep and very rocky, almost like climbing stairs. once past the lower falls The people on the trail thin out a lot. it continues quite steep all the way to the upper falls. The reservoir was really rough. climbing giant rocks from a long ago rock slide and looking for rockpiles for direction. it was worth it though, amazing reservoir. I hiked out at night which I would not recommend. I lost the trail a few times and if I were to fall, I would have to wait it out till morning.",
668,2015-10-19,['hiking'],"So glad we got up early to beat the rain and get this hike in! It was gorgeous. We overshot the trail and ended up above the falls. There was some pretty consistent steep and rocky parts to the trail.  Took a break and then hiked down. Totally worth the extra mileage. Beautiful small falls and pools of clear water all along the way down. The water is low, but still worth the hike. 
Definitely a great sunset hike if you're into that. Could watch sunset from the lower reservoir and then take the easy trail down.",

It wasn't too busy hiking up to the lower falls but become almost desolate above that. I saw one group of three the whole time up and one more arrived at the high-reservoir while I was there. 
The hike to the high reservoir has it all! It was one of the prettiest Utah hikes I've ever done. Small mossy waterfalls on the way up and a few openings where you are able to see the valley. The reservoir itself was stunning. Desolate, pretty blue tint of the lake, trees surrounding you. The lake sits in a little valley itself. Beautiful place. Follow the cairns and you will be fine. The trail is pretty well marked for the most part. I want to overnight camp up at the lake now!",
671,2015-10-01,['hiking'],"There should probably be a separate hike page for the lower reservoir, lower falls, upper falls, and upper reservoir. I haven't gone to the upper reservoir, so I'll just review the other three. The hike to the lower lake is short and easy. Less than a mile, and about 350 ft elevation gain. The hike to the lower falls is harder. They are about 2 miles after the lake, and another 1000 ft. The upper falls are about 1.25 miles after that, and another 750 feet. The difficult part about this trail is not the elevation gain (a little under 3000 ft total to the upper falls in a little less than 4 miles) it is that the trail to the falls is mostly comprised of boulders. It is more like climbing tall stairs than walking a steep trail. I hike several times a week, about 15-20 miles a week. I'm in pretty decent hiking shape, and am rarely sore after a hike. This hike left me sore for a few days. Physically, it is one of the harder day hikes I have done. Would definitely not recommend if you have bad knees. 

All of that being said, it was definitely worth it! The trail was gorgeous. The falls were amazing. The trail was somewhat more crowded at the beginning, but thinned out the further you got up the trail. Most people stuck it out and made it to the lower falls (which is the more impressive of the two) but I did not see another soul on the trail after that. 

The turn off to the lower falls is NOT marked. I missed it the first time, and actually made it to the upper falls first. You have to keep an eye out. There is a very large pine tree on the left side of the trail, and that is where the trail splits. It's obvious when you're looking for it, but I didn't even notice it. Just start paying attention around the 2.5 mile mark of your hike :)

Other parts of the trail aren't marked great either, a GPS app of some sort is always a great idea. 

I'm trying to work up the courage to go to the upper reservoir ;)",
672,2015-09-25,['hiking'],This was by far one of my favorite trails to do. I loved the falls at the end and the lake towards the start of the hike is so serene -- it was nice to appreciate the view on the way down for a minute before leaving.,
673,2015-09-21,['hiking'],Good,
674,2015-09-21,[''],This is one of my favorite hikes. It is a short drive from the valley to the trailhead. You can get to the first waterfall in under an hour if your quick. So if you only have a couple hours but want a tough quick hike this one is fantastic!!,
675,2015-09-20,['hiking'],"Only went to the waterfall, but this is formidable to the casual hiker. Make sure to have boots with good support because you'll be walking up a creek bed at a 25 degree slope. Without support, your feet will be gripping boulders and you will tire out quickly.",

If you decided to go higher, it's a heck of a hike- I decided to head back down after a massive headache (dehydrated) (should have packed a lunch)- Lake Blanche looks like a piece of cake compared to this one. but I greatly enjoyed the dessert, Boulder jumping, random trails, streams, views, great photo opportunities",

From parking lot to upper reservoir and back in total we recorded well over 11.5~ miles. Not sure if we took a longer way?! We did get lost coming back down and had a crazy time scrambling and climbing down boulders. We also didn't plan the timing too well and reached the top around 7pm and quickly just turned back around because sun down was around 8:45pm, needless to say, we hiked about 4 miles down at night with flashlights and I highly recommend against any sort of night hiking on this trail, please, please go early and plan to be at your car well before sun down! We had 5 liters of water between the two of us and we were both out about two miles before the hike ended, so if it's a hot day, plan well and bring a good amount of water!",
681,2015-08-30,['hiking'],"This hike could be described a bit better. Generally, there are 4 destinations. #2 is most popular and should be rated as moderate. The full trail (to #4) is certainly difficult. 

1) the lower reservoir – maybe a mile or so, one way.
2) the lower waterfall – about 3.4 miles round trip, and 1,800 elevation gain. 
3) the upper waterfall – about 5.6 miles round trip, and 2,360 elevation gain.
4) the upper reservoir – about 8.4 miles round trip, and 4,150 elevation gain.

The Bells Canyon trail is very easy to follow – just stay on the obvious trail that has plenty of granite rocks in the path. However, to get to the lower waterfall (#2 above), look for a large pine tree on your left – about 1.7 miles up the trail. That tree marks a short and steep trail that takes you to the waterfall. It's a very short hike (about 100 yards) from the main trail to the falls. You'll be able to hear them, but won't see them from the main trail.",

We hiked the longer, but less steep trail, to Bell Canyon Reservoir. When you get to the lake if you take a left and hike for about 100 feet, you come to a little trail that goes into the trees. The trail will take you to a bridge with a stream underneath it and you can take the trail all the way around the lake. The kids did great. The hike is about 2 miles RT, if you hike around the lake. A nice hike that is close to the valley and fun for the family.",

If you go past the reservoir, and past the Bells Canyon Trail sign, there's a turnoff to the left that will take you parallel to the creek all the way to the waterfall. The hike was a bit much at the last quarter mile because it is steep. We saw a few families with small children in backpack carriers, or they were carried. If you go above the waterfall there are a few small cascades with clear blue water. Just be careful not to get too close to the slippery edge of the waterfall. Also, take more than enough food and water. It took my friend and I about 4 ½ hours for the whole thing.",

I parked along side the road and had no issue getting ticketed.  The trail starts out in the open and can be hot.  Once you reach the stream it is a little more shaded.  The falls are nice and can be reached fairly easily for a  day hike.  The Upper reservoir on the other hand is fairly difficult especially with an overnight pack.  It is more or less straight up with quite a bit of scrambling over boulders to get there.  I would say start as early as possible if you plan on reaching the upper lake.  Once there it is great aside from the normal mosquitos around a slow moving water source.  We camped up above the lake with hammocks and there were a few less bugs.  You can continue past the lake to some peaks, but I would only recommend this for experienced people doing a multi day trip, or someone starting early traveling light.  Overall great hard hike with amazing views of the SLC city valley.",

704,2015-07-19,['hiking'],Best waterfall on the watasch front.,
705,2015-07-16,['hiking'],"Was a great hike! I did it solo, but it was really fun the hear the water all along the trail! Love Little Cottonwood soooo much!",
706,2015-07-13,['hiking'],Amazing! This is a hard hike but worth it. We calculated that we hiked up over 380 flights of stairs. Lots of the trail was covered in shade that was provided by trees and tall bushes. Our favorite part was the diverse scenery and the granite boulders that you climb before the reservoir.,
707,2015-07-09,[''],"First hike out here in Utah. Strenuous but wonderful. Only 6 miles of the 9 mile hike because being from New York, the elevation got the best of me. Definitely looking forward to completing it soon!",
708,2015-06-29,['hiking'],"Chances are the trail will be crowded, but it is definitely worth it. The closer you get to the falls, the trail gets steeper. Push through, and the views will be incredible.",
709,2015-06-29,[''],Great hike with plenty of picture opportunities.  If you go to the upper reservoir there are many side trails and some of them lead up some pretty difficult terrain.  One of the better hikes close to salt lake valley.,
710,2015-06-29,['trail running'],Beautiful and worth the time and effort.,
711,2015-06-29,[''],Good and moderately hard,
712,2015-06-27,['hiking'],"We did not reach the top or the end. We only got to the lower fall, because of our kids. 

The trails to the lower reservoir are easily accessible and well used. 

It gets more difficult to reach the lower fall. You are mostly near a creek and the temperature is 10-20 degrees cooler than that at the trail head. 

I think that it is progressively harder to reach the top. 

It can be crowded on holidays and weekends. Good for families with older kids.",
713,2015-06-20,['hiking'],Only did lower Bells Canyon Twice and on one ocation around the lake ,
714,2015-06-18,['hiking'],Too crowded!,
715,2015-06-15,['hiking'],Great hike! Mostly rocky trail and a lot of direct sunlight until you get into the forest. Some steep parts especially when you get close to the falls. There is a definite fork in the trail when you are very close to the falls. Take the left in the fork for a short distance to the payoff.,
716,2015-06-14,[''],It was great,
717,2015-06-14,['hiking'],"This is a great hike, but get there early for two reasons: 1) The crowds. 2) The heat. You'll find shade for about half this hike up to the waterfall, but during a hot summer day you better expect to soak up some rays on this one. There are tons of people on this hike, so don't expect to find tranquility in solitude unless you hike past the waterfall. After the falls, the trail continues much like it does the quarter mile before the falls; very steep... We found a nice dome formation about half a mile after the falls to hang out on before turning around for the day. Good luck to you if you make it to the Upper Reservoir. You have more stamina than I.",
718,2015-06-11,[''],It was so fantastic. The last half mile until the waterfall is pretty intense but the waterfall is worth it!,
719,2015-06-06,['hiking'],"The waterfall it's peacefully and refreshing, nice hiking, little steep like 1/2 mile before the waterfall but it's worked, just be careful the ground is little wet by the waterfall.",
720,2015-06-02,[''],"Good, moderately strenuous hike.  Only wanted to go to the lower falls, but the trail wasn't well marked, and we were at least 1/2 mile past it before we realized our mistake and doubled back.  Waterfall was nice reward though :)",
721,2015-06-02,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! Great workout too. The waterfall is beautiful, theres even more water coming down than last week when I hiked it. Please be careful if youre up top of the waterfall.",
722,2015-06-01,['hiking'],Really nice hike with a well groomed trail. The waterfall was totally with it.,
723,2015-05-30,['hiking'],"Took my 9 and 11 year old. They managed it well without struggle. It's a busy trail even past the reservoir. But it's a great hike, with nice views of the valley, cliff walls. The fall is beautiful!",
724,2015-05-26,['hiking'],Really intense once you get past the left hand turn to the lower falls. Upper falls are beautiful. Last 1/4 is still pretty wet.,
725,2015-05-25,[''],It's a great hike!,
726,2015-05-08,['hiking'],"This is a hike I do regularly and it offers something for everyone.  There are two trailheads, one off of Wasatch and the other off of Little Cottonwood Road.  I greatly prefer the trailhead off of Little Cottonwood as the Wasatch trailhead has very large steps, loose gravel and is very steep at times.  Little Cottonwood is easier and has nicer views back of the city.  It's about a .5 mile to the Lower Bell Canyon Reservoir and this is where many people stop.  It's  gorgeous view of both the reservoir and back at the city from here.  It's a great spot for sunset.  If you continue up the trail you'll get to the falls.  The last .5 miles to the falls is the steepest and if you continue past the falls, which most do not, it continues to be steep pretty much until the end.  If you make it to the end of the trail you're rewarded with a great view of mountains and the city below.  From trailhead to the end it is about 6 miles roundtrip.",
727,2015-04-29,[''],Made it to waterfall.  No snow great warm up.  It is flowing good.  What a view.  I prefer the Trailhead from Wasatch not LC C.,
728,2015-04-06,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes. I did it Jan 31, and a little more recently on the March 28th. This is an easy hike with beautiful views of Salt Lake. Once you get to the reservoir, there are several paths you can take. Both times we just circled around the reservoir and it was a perfect little hike. This is a VERY heavily populated trail, especially in the beginning. There are a lot of large groups which can make it difficult to pass if you want to go a little faster. The earlier you go, the better.",
729,2015-04-04,['hiking'],"Great place to hike, the upper reservoir is a great hike and hardly anyone goes beyond the first couple of waterfalls. Snowshoes are needed for some parts this early in the year.
Please note that dogs are not allowed. This is a watershed area and the fines for taking a dog on the trail will cost you.
Also, I'd recommend taking more than just a single water bottle for the hike to the falls, you can (and probably should) drink a good bit as you hike this one. For upper reservoir, I use a water filter and refill in the stream above the falls. Safe hiking!",
730,2015-04-04,['hiking'],"I went with my 4, 7, 9 year old all the way up to the Bell Canyon waterfall. It was a little hard for my 4 year old going up, but he made it, we had to take a lot of breaks. Be prepared if you will be going with your kids, but the trail and the views are worth to try it,",
731,2015-03-26,['hiking'],"Great trail! The first part of the trail (To the reservoir) is easy access and friendly to families and dogs. At the beginning of the trail, there is a river that you cross, by bridge that is really beautiful. The lake has fish, ducks, and a great reflection at night. Definitely recommend!",
732,2015-03-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful, simple hike. Trail is mostly surrounded by trees and is well kept. There are a couple of forks you should study up on before you go. The trail is rather season as well. The trail can get snowed and iced over through the winter. However, it should be clear by mid-April. The falls are gorgeous, shaded, and well worth the trip. Several people enjoy rock climbing off the end of this trail as well.",
733,2015-02-11,['camping'],"We started at 11p.m. that night and hiked till 2a.m. Woke up to a beautiful granite wall and fall colors. We headed to the top and played on the scree fields towards the summit early in the morning. Incredible view and sunrise. I remember strongly how fantastic the wooded areas and streams were. Overall very well kept trail. Clearly marked. There had been a little foot traffic congestion towards the bottom by the reservoir, to be expected at the lower portion. ",
734,2015-01-28,['snowshoeing'],"Jake, the answer is yes. Three of us made it to the upper reservoir on Jan 1st. Took all day and then some, but the scenery was gorgeous.  I don't recommend trying that unless you already know the way.",
735,2014-12-28,['hiking'],"Great hike with beautiful white ""false granite"" cliff faces. At least two waterfalls to see that I know of. The first is the best but easy to miss. Trail is very steep after about a mile past the lake.",
736,2014-10-11,['hiking'],"I hiked this trail for the first time this week. The weather was perfect for hiking; crisp air and blue skies. This hike is quite steep in parts, but very doable if you take your time. We hiked to the first falls and I was grateful that I was with a friend who had been there before, because the trail to the falls is not marked. We had several people ask us for directions. The granite peaks and fall leaves were breathtaking. I look forward to hiking this trail again.",
737,2014-09-28,['hiking'],Nothing quite like it. It's very steep and hiking at times is akin to climbing up a rocky creek bed (spring runoff may have something to do with this characteristic..). But Extraordinarily beautiful up there. In the summer months get an early start. I also found a few mosquito bites on me later that day.,
738,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"Love this hike! Been on it a couple of times. If its your first time, it might be a little difficult but it's definitely beautiful and worth it!!",
739,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"hiked this trail so many times this year alone, probably 50 times. I almost feel like I can close my eyes and walk this trail hahaha. seriously, so beautiful and worth the 10-15 minutes! I LOVE UTAH",
740,2014-08-17,['hiking'],Hiked the trail to the upper reservoir yesterday. It took me 6 hrs but was well worth the hike. It is a pretty tough hike to do if you aren't in shape. One of my favourite trails to hike. Didn't see any one after the first falls.,
741,2014-08-01,[''],"After the first ""falls"", I saw very few people.  I had the reservoir to myself for about a half hour.  It was lush, green, and peaceful with only the sound of fish jumping.  I did lose the trail for a minute coming back down because I wasn't paying attention, but it's pretty well marked if you look around.  Careful if rain is in the forecast, because there are a lot of granite slabs to hike over.",
742,2014-07-28,[''],I think the 9 mile distance is WAY off. Other's list the hike to the first waterfall as 2 miles. This is such a beautiful hike and definitely worth the effort.,
743,2014-07-24,['hiking'],Love this hike it's hard and it's so close I love it.,
744,2014-06-23,['hiking'],"Busy little trail, but like everyone else says, a fairly good amount of solitude past the reservoir. Hike gets prettier and prettier the farther up the canyon. Water is running at very high levels, be careful on the slick rock covered in moss. Multiple people have died, and it's easy to see why. A lot of good camping spots after the first mile or two.
I would never hike this trail on a weekend. Probably the busiest in Utah.",
745,2014-06-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, beautiful falls.  The first mile is VERY crowded with people going up to the reservoir (I came up via little cottonwood road) even on a weekday.  The next 1 mile up is still fairly easy, then the last 1/2 mile or so before the fall was steeper.  All of it in a gorgeous deep mountain valley.  That whole section is still busy, and I'll probably add to the crowd by bringing my kids (avid hikers) up sometime soon.  Above the falls the crowds dramatically thin out and the views continue.  Really most of the canyon above the falls is steep enough that the whole creek is practically a continuous fall, but nothing you can easily see to quite match that first big fall.  The climb gives you a brief break at the meadow at about 7900'.  Make sure you keep to the right here, only crossing one major creek.  It took me a minute to find the trail, but it was clear once I found it.  then you continue the relentless but beautiful climb, through a rock field, and up a ridge angling away from the main creek (and toward the reservoir still pretty far above).  Nearing 9000' the snow made the trailer ever harder to find and finally impassable, but the brush is thin enough at that altitude that it was pretty easy to just pick a route and go.  The top is an austere wilderness which feels very different from the lush canyon far below.  Routes from there go to South Thunder Mountain and Big Horn, but Lone Peak is not accessible from this side.",
746,2014-04-28,['trail running'],"This is one of my favorite trails in Utah that aren't too far away ( right outside of sandy) that offer lots of beauty and a challenging enough trail for some good conditioning with a really good vibe. Usually a little crowded the first mile ( which is the most intense part, make it to the lake and it gets alot easier) but not as many people finish. Enjoy!

747,2014-04-17,['hiking'],"This trail is gorgeous but 2 things: one, I would never take my smaller kids b/c it is a hard trail with slippery and treacherous spots, and two, even if you feel confident about hiking here, you still need to exercise caution and common sense about navigating the falls. Excerpt from KSL,  local news source:

June 28, 2010
Search and rescue teams returned to Bells Canyon in Sandy Monday morning to possibly resume the search for 26-year-old Kimberly Evans, who was swept away in the fast-moving creek over the weekend
Authorities believe her body is pinned underwater by the swift current. They say it could be weeks before they find her body because it may stay submerged in the water until the snowmelt is over in an area where they saw logs fall in and disappear.
It's the second incident in a week, raising safety concerns for hikers in Bells Canyon

So, if you're going to exercise caution and care, it's a great hike and a great workout. But be aware and be safe. My friend also told me she ran into a rattlesnake on this trail. There are warning signs so take heed.",
748,2014-04-11,['hiking'],"Still quite a bit of snow, which impedes time, and creates for a slick, grueling descent. Steep climb at beginning as you climb up the terraced pathway. After that, you'll gain elevation at a moderate rate. Beautiful vistas making it worth the scramble in the snow. Deer and geese at the lower res. didn't quite make it to the upper res. Will def be going back once the snow has melted.",
749,2014-03-16,['hiking'],"We only went up to the first falls, but the views from this trail were awesome. I'm itching to go up again when I have time to go all the way to the top.",
750,2014-03-09,['hiking'],"Torturous fun in the snow. Be prepared with the right equipment for traction. No mater what equipment you have on the way down you will be on your ass sliding on the ice. If you make it to the top you will get an outstanding view of the valley and far into the great salt lake. 

Can't wait to try it again in the summer.

751,2014-01-27,['walking'],"this place is amazing. I like to go just past the lake and go off of the trail to the left up that little peak. it had the BEST view. and I just moved to utah from Atlanta Georgia, so it's pretty impressive to me. this has been my favorite hike so far.",
752,2014-01-15,['hiking'],"Absolutely gorgeous hike that was full of changing scenery & color. I got a bit sidetracked at one point (mountains & colors called me), but I was able to easily get back on track. I would highly recommend this hike.",
753,2013-10-21,['hiking'],"This hike is awesome hands down (my 2nd time), I wouldn't rate it as strenuous as they have it down for though. The hardest part is right when you make the left to goto the waterfall is where it gets a little rocky and steep. You should be able to make it to the waterfall in 2-3hrs if you go at a steady pace. I've even gone beyond that to attempt to get to the reservoir but didn't have enough time to do it so had to turn back. This is one of my favorite hikes and would suggest it to anyone. Remember to go early in the spring when the waterfall is flowing good with all the snow melt. If you wait till June/July its not as impressive as it can be (still pretty through).",
754,2013-09-08,['hiking'],"Hiked the entire trail to Upper Bells Canyon reservoir. Trail is very steep and rocky. I usually average 2+ mph but was only able to manage 1.6 mpg on this one. Stopped at the reservoir and walked around a while and also stopped at the Lower Falls which was part of the reason for the slower mph. Still enjoyed the hike a lot especially at the upper end where we could look clear down the canyon not only to downtown Salt Lake, but looked down on Mount Olympus and could also see Twin Peaks. The granite bells and walls in the Canyon were stunning",
755,2013-08-21,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite trails for a few reasons.. Its not too far away from the city, its great for a workout, even better for sunsets.. You can enjoy fishing at the lake thats about a mile up past the hard part of the trail. It evens out and isn't very rough after that!",
756,2013-08-20,['hiking'],"This hike was fun, and just the right amount of strenuous for myself and those who originally planned to come.   We made it to the second falls before the beleaguered calls from those who had pooped out at the first waterfall forced us to turn around.   I would love to come back (preferably in the spring or early summer) to see the second reservoir.  ",
757,2013-08-19,['hiking'],"When people talk about hiking Bells Canyon, they generally mean one of three destinations: 1) the lower reservoir, 2) the lower falls or 3) the upper falls. If you want a high adventure experience that will totally kick your butt, go for the 4th destination and see the upper reservoir at the end of Bells Canyon! To get an idea of how strenuous it really is, we made it to the lower falls in 1 hour (that's the half-way point at 2.3 miles). The brutal part came with the second 2.3 miles that took us 3 hours!! The upper portion is steep, rocky and very rugged. There are sections that you *must* look for the cairns (small pile of rocks) that mark the trail. As hard as it was, this was an awesome experience (notice the 5 star rating) and one I'd do again.",
758,2013-08-15,['hiking'],"Unfortunately I attempted this hike after a 6 day stretch of 12 hour shifts and it kicked my butt.  I also did not research it very well as I was unaware of the upper and lower waterfalls.  I hiked for up for an hour and half and ran out of steam.  I must have been close to the falls.  It is a pretty strenuous hike and I will go back to get to the falls.  It is beautiful hike and I got my first glimpse of wildlife, since being in Utah, when I came upon a deer.  That was pretty neat.",
759,2013-08-13,['hiking'],beautiful hike! Not difficult to get to the lake. To the waterfall is more strenuous but so worth it.,
760,2013-08-11,['hiking'],I hiked to the first water fall Friday morning. It was a great hike. My track showed 4.77 miles round trip from the parking lot on Wasatch. ,
761,2013-08-08,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike and one of my favorites in the Salt Lake Valley. Steep and rugged in places but it follows a nice stream and is shaded most of the way. Lots of people on this trail, so be social! Enjoy the waterfalls at the trail's end and peak down the valley for a great sunset view. Was able to complete this trail after work and was back to the car before dark. ",
762,2013-08-04,['hiking'],This hike is one of my favorite I've been on. Getting to the lower lake is worth the hike and its super fun to hang out by the lake. There are a lot of little paths to explore and there is a waterfall near by when you reach the lake. I definitely recommend this hike. ,
763,2013-07-30,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail. Adequate shade and water sources available if you have a filter. Be careful around the lower falls, it is damp and slippery. Upper reservoir is spectacular but I would bring crampons to access it if going before July since the snow is still moderately deep and crusty. ",
764,2013-07-24,['hiking'],"I've been doing the quick day hike to the lower reservoir for 15 years now. It has easy access from Salt Lake City and the surrounding areas. The path is heavily used and well worn so knowing where to go is not an issue. Views from the trail above the lower reservoir are great. Fishing is possible here though we have only ever caught one over the years. The falls are good, but I enjoy the views of the lower reservoir more.",

766,2013-07-08,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite hikes! I have hiked Bells Canyon for over 20 years and it is still as fun as it was my first time up. The only con is that there are a ton of people but they are typically friendly so it could be worse. ,
767,2013-07-05,['hiking'],Favorite hike I've been on in Utah so far! Challenging if you want to go to top reservoir. But definitely worth it. ,
768,2013-06-03,['hiking'],This is my 2nd year in Utah and I have not done any trails since Ive been here but am very excited to hike this year. My friends took me on this trail a few weeks ago for my first real hike. It was in my opinion difficult but I loved every second of it. We went to the first waterfall but there is a second which I hear is steeper to get to. Cant wait until we do that one:),
769,2013-06-02,['hiking'],Great hike! First half mile is the hardest part for sure. Scenery is fantastic especially around the lake. Very green! ,
770,2013-03-31,['hiking'],Very good trail. Enjoyed the scenery. The beginning was the toughest part. Nice walk around the oversized pond as well. ,
771,2012-10-03,['hiking'],"The trail to the lower falls is fairly easy and can be busy on the weekends but the trail gets rocky and steeper as you go further into the canyon. This hike was recommended to me by a local hiker and noted if you want to see Utah, this is the hike for you. 

At one point, I was disappointed that I didn't see any wildlife during the whole day until I came upon a rattlesnake that warned me with his rattle.  It didn't take long for him to hide in the bushes. There's quite a few people that run on this trail to the lower falls and it makes me wonder how many people get bit by snakes.  ",
772,2012-09-14,['hiking'],Went all the way to the Upper Reservoir on 9/13. One of my most favorite hikes! Definitely a quad burner though...the trail gets crazy steep before the first waterfall and a few spots past the waterfall.  The Reservoir up top was a little bit of a let down - very small and dirty - but the views on the way up are breathtaking!! Highly recommend this trail to anyone up for a challenge. ,
773,2012-09-03,['hiking'],"My 12 year old son and I completed the hike to the Upper Reservoir in about five and a half hours. With a 40lb pack it was very difficult on the third leg.  It takes about an hour and a half to get the first water fall, and another hour to get to the second water fall. You can miss the second water fall unless you take the left fork after the large round dome shaped rock.  If you go right, at the nearly hidden fork, you will eventually hit a newly built log bridge after about 45 minutes.  If you go to the second waterfall there is a bridge across the stream and a path that will eventually bring you to the new Upper Bridge about an hour later.  Some campers were set up at the Upper Bridge.  From here it is about 1 and a half hours to the reservoir provided you don't get lost.  From the Upper Bridge follow the trail and the kerns.  There are two boulder fields; you can go around one of these. The critical trail change is about hour past the Upper Bridge and after the boulder field, you will enter a wooded area where the trail forks. Go Left and follow the kerns along the rock wall. You will cross back over to the little stream and up to the reservoir.   ",
774,2012-08-30,['hiking'],"Amazing hike i use to look at these falls as a kid from my parents house, finally got around to doing it. It's about  1 1/2 up with short stops. I wore tennis shoes saving on weight from my hiking boots, I'm thinking the boots would have been better there is a lot of rocks on the trail and it is hell on the bottom of the feet. Once you get up there you cross over a small creek that the trail goes through then about 15 feet above that is a large tree on the left follow the trail and you need to traverse down to the falls. Well worth the hike..",
775,2012-08-15,['hiking'],gorgeous lake barely a mile up....perfect hike for families with kids. the falls are 4 miles and the latter half is very difficult bur worth two breathtaking views...the 50 ft waterfall and turn around to see the valley through the canyon!,
776,2012-08-06,['hiking'],"By far the most strenuous hike I've experienced in Utah. I've only been here for a couple of months, so lots of hikes are still brand new to me. I only made it to the waterfall because I ran out of water. Don't drink the water from the fall unless you have some sort of filter that kills bacteria in the water. There is very few parking spaces. There were lots of paths that u can take, but try you best to listen for the creek and follow the water. The most strenuous part was hiking up the steep rocky path for approximately 30 mins and then sliding down the mountain to get to the bottom of the waterfall. Very beautiful and worth every achy pain on my body. Enjoy the hike!",
777,2012-07-31,['hiking'],"This is a great trail, I've been hearing about it for years and finally went. It's a little strenuous but it's short so I wouldn't quite put it in that category. The best part was hiking around the backside of the lake. It was dark by the time we got back there so I'd like to do it again so I can see the waterfalls but it was still very pleasant. I love knowing there's a beautiful hike like that so close to the city. ",
778,2012-07-09,['hiking'],"This trail was beautiful.  I wish I would of done my  research prior to going, we hiked for a total round trip of 8 miles and managed to miss the 2nd waterfall and the upper reservoir.  The first waterfall still had plenty of water and was gorgeous. We actually waited until we came down to see that one.  We did not realize how close the second waterfall was nor that you should cross over near it to hike to the reservoir.  It was funny because about 2 miles into someone told us about 2.5 miles to the upper reservoir then 4 miles into it about to start climbing over some serious boulders a guy told us another 2.5 miles.  Needless to say we were not prepared for that long of a hike and hesitantly turned around.  There were others that were on the same trail that had to make the difficult choice as well.   Overall one of the best hikes I've done in Utah so far, still sore from coming down.  I don't usually do the same hike twice, but I might make an exception to see everything I missed.  ",
779,2012-07-01,['hiking'],"Great trail! Getting to the ""blue skis"" at the first waterfall is not to bad. The rest of the trail beyond gets tough! Beautiful scenery although be prepared for a tough hike over large rocks if you're bound for the second lake. ",
780,2012-06-18,['hiking'],This would have to be one of the better hikes that I have done. I would recommend this to others however be aware that there is a few places that are pretty steep and rocky but not to difficult the falls are simply breathtaking and the views of the valley are worth the hike. There were alot of people on the trail today and not alot of parking at the trail head most people only went to the lake after passing the lake on the way to the falls there is less people.,
781,2012-06-08,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. The falls are amazing and the views are stunning. Very rocky in parts, and quite steep in some places, this is a hike that would be perfect for a family outing or a day in the mountains.

782,2012-06-02,['hiking'],"Hiking to the first lake takes about 30-45 mins and its family friendly. Going past that I would only bring avid hikers. We hiked to the second waterfall and it took us a little over 2hrs (w/2 short water breaks). Its a steep trail and we noticed a lot of people turn around that could not make it to the second falls. I would do this again and recommend it to anyone. Great Views, Wildlife, and a good workout. ",

784,2012-04-07,['hiking'],I have hiked this trail 4 times to the lower waterfall.  Beautiful scenery.  This hike is easy until about one half mile past the reservoir then it gets real rocky and steep.  Be careful at the waterfall because it can be real muddy and slippery.  One of my favorite hikes.,
785,2012-04-01,['hiking'],"just got done with the hike, it was nice.. took me an hour and half to reach the waterfall.  It wasn't terribly difficult, but wasn't easy either. You can almost miss the waterfall if you don't know where it is.  Luckily I ran into people on the trail that knew where is was. The trip down was more tough for me due to my legs legs were tired and it was kind of icy on the upper part of the trail.",
786,2011-09-16,['hiking'],Wonderfully hard canyon,
787,2011-06-19,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. It took much longer than 2.5 hours as suggested- partly bc I started at a different trailhead bc the directions were wrong and I got lost, then when I connected to bells canyon, it was a miracle I found the falls bc the trail forks several times. Luckily I ran into some hikers along the way and they gave me good advice-always stay on the trail that's rockier and has granite. I was able to find it. My advice however is to go with someone who has already done it.",
788,2011-05-12,['hiking'],"Went to Bells Canyon just to stomp around in the snow.  Just beautiful here.  Didn't make it to the falls, but enjoyed walking around the reservoir and through the trees.",
789,2010-08-18,['hiking'],"Didn't have any idea where the first water fall was or even if there was one.
Almost miss it. Turned around heading back at the stream a few feet from falls.
Lucky for us, a young hiker came upon my buddy and I, told us we were there. Turn  left toward the river going up at the stream. Never would of found it. Was our secondy try. Beautiful and worth it.",
790,2010-08-02,['hiking'],"Did this hike twice this summer but only went up to the first falls.  Beautiful in the spring.  Sometimes it's muddy if you're too early.  Sun can be very hot for the first hour or so, but once you get up into the canyon it's pretty shaded and quite comfortable.  Very beautiful canyon.  Can't wait to get a more avid hiker to go to the reservoir with me.  I'm sure it's gorgeous. ",
791,2010-05-16,['hiking'],"Great hike!! The first lake is an easy hike for families and has good views for sunsets. The first 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile aren't bad but after that it gets  steep and stays that way. The first waterfall is about 45 minutes from the trailhead and approximately 35 to 50 feet tall. The second waterfall is about another 30 to 45 minutes past the first falls. It's also about 50 to 75 feet tall but more of a slide than a fall. About another 45 to 60 minutes beyond the second falls is a reservoir. A great hike but bring lot's of water, snacks and start early.",
