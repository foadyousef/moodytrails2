2,2019-08-17,['hiking'],A bit steep for young ones but it was a fun hike!
3,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"We didn’t make it all the way to Dog Lake today, my four year old wasn’t feeling it, but we still enjoyed getting outside and appreciated the spectacular mountain scenery and the many gorgeous and color wildflowers."
4,2019-08-06,['hiking'],"So-so hike. Best hiked in cooler weather. The rating should be Mod-Hard due to higher altitude. The distances are suspect as the signage implies this is a 5.2 mile hike up and back. I found the scenery boring, with the exception of a few views of mountains. And dog lake is named properly. Check out the pictures. "
5,2019-08-06,['hiking'],the hike was beautiful but the lake not so much. its shady in alot of areas and there was a nice stream along the way. pretty flowers on the trail. we saw a deer on the way down.watch out for bikers! 
6,2019-07-31,['hiking'],"This was more like 5 miles round trip, over 1,000 feet elevation. But, it was very nice. Awesome flowers, great trail, nice place to find some solitude. Only passed a few people today (Wednesday). Would recommend! "
7,2019-07-31,['hiking'],"Took us a couple hours to hike the way up. Dog lake and Desolation lake share the same trail for the first 2 miles and then it splits. Dog lake is to the left. 

It was my first time doing the hike. Great beautiful hike. Dog lake itself was ok I wouldn’t wanna picture with it. Everyone said that Desolation was prettier. I’ll have to compare it next time"

9,2019-07-27,['hiking'],Hihihivcv
10,2019-07-27,['hiking'],Beautiful wildflowers! Definitely my favorite hike in Utah so far!
11,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"Lots of bugs during the day and lake wasn’t very impressive. However, the trail itself was beautiful and the hike wasn’t too difficult."
12,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
13,2019-07-21,['hiking'],Great day! Pretty busy on the trail but most everyone was nice. Dog Lake lived up to its name. Easily a dozen or more dogs up from the Millcreek side swimming for sticks. A good training day for this sea level transplant.
14,2019-07-14,['hiking'],Great moderately challenging trail.  Pretty well shaded along the entire way to Dog Lake.  Gets a little steep towards the end but there are a ton of shady spots to take a break if you need to catch your breath.  The trail is also wide enough the entire way to make passing opposing traffic easy. There were some biting flies and mosquitos along the way so bring bug spray if you are susceptible to bites.  Mill D North fork was flowing briskly on July 10th.  Cool and refreshing!
15,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"6 & 9 year old daughters went with, they had no trouble with a few breaks and liked stopping by the creek on the way up.  Lake wasn’t too exciting bit still a nice hike."
16,2019-07-04,['hiking'],"Easy hike without anything steep.  Went to Desolation, walked all the way around and had 100 yds. of snow on the back side of the lake.  No big deal to navigate.  
Took the trail to Dog Lake, went around and then back to the parking lot.  
Trail is in great shape.  If you want to miss the steep section, head past the first turn off and take the upper trail.  Adds about a mile to the hike but you'll do it in the same amount of time without the climb.
Just get out and hike!!!!!"
17,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"Nice quick hike. All of the trail is dry now. Easy hike until the last .5 to the lake 
"
18,2019-06-25,['hiking'],All the snow is melted on the trail and lake is fully melted. Nice relaxing hike with only a short steep part at the end. 
19,2019-06-22,['hiking'],A good short hike 
20,2019-06-15,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Beautiful trail. A little muddy and snowy the last mile
21,2019-06-14,"['hiking', 'snow']",This is always my first Big Cottonwood hike of the season. The brush around the creek isn’t too tall and I really enjoy being near the water. My first experience with snow packed trails. 
22,2019-06-08,['hiking'],"6/7/19–5.35pm: Just came down from this hike and it was beautiful. It started out pretty moderate, but gained a substantial increase as we went along. The trail itself is well maintained with a lot of great look out points. We saw a small snake on the trail, quite a few pot guts, and a couple of squirrels. We heard some cries that could have possibly been from a cat so be alert! We didn’t make it far enough up the trail to get to the lake or even the fork. All in all, pretty great trail! Most important thing: NO SNOW ON THE TRAIL(as far as we went haha)!"
23,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'snow']",6/1/19 9.15-12pm. 50s mostly cloudy. After ~1 mile snow starts and at 1.5miles only packed snow. Made it to frozen Dog Lake without crampons but it's a trudge. Worth it to see the pristine beauty.  Only me and a snowman for a 30min stop.  Gorgeous.  
24,2019-02-23,"['hiking', 'snow']","It was pretty packed most if way, but snowshoes were helpful toward end. Want at least spikes in snow. Saw some cross country skiers on 2nd half of hike, but could be from a trail that merged. It helps to have offline map in snow, if you haven’t done before, as at least one place the trail split, and I referred to alltrails map."
25,2019-02-17,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'snow']",Thought I wouldn’t need snowshoes but a couple of moose decided to lay down on the trail.
26,2019-02-02,['hiking'],"The snow was pretty packed down, but certain areas are a little loose. Snowshoes not required, but they make hiking this trail a lot easier. The are parts where the trail will split, so having a trail tracker is helpful. The lake was completely frozen over, so we could walk across it."
27,2019-01-30,['hiking'],"1/30 Beautiful trail, not much traffic. The lake is covered in snow in the winter so you don’t get great views at the top  but the entire hike itself is beautiful and has amazing views. On our way down we had a mama, baby, and papa moose right on the trail. It was crazy. Definitely will be doing this hike again in the spring/summer. Used yaktrax but they weren’t a necessity."
28,2019-01-03,['snowshoeing'],"Snowshoed on 12/31. I recommend bringing micro spikes, although they aren’t absolutely necessary. Snow shoes no longer needed because the snow is packed down from all the backcountry skiers using the trail to get up onto the upper slopes. Feasible to do in just boots or even sneakers, until the next snow fall."
29,2019-01-02,[''],Great snow shoeing today!
30,2018-11-03,[''],cold today but decent conditions. some muddy spots but not too slippery. packed down snow last half mile. brought spikes but didnt use them.
31,2018-10-12,['hiking'],"Cold and snowy today!  First part very muddy, turning to ice and then near the lake hiked in 2 feet of snow.  We were going to hike to Desolation but didn’t have our snowshoes on!  I like this hike but today was not great.  Slipped and fell a lot on the way down even in good hiking boots."
32,2018-09-30,['hiking'],"This hike was awesome! Not too steep, just the right length of time for me (1 hour 15 m to get up to the lake) and beautiful!  The colors are amazing right now. A lot of shade and tons of aspens. It is a busy trail, especially with bikers but it was fine for me."
33,2018-08-19,['hiking'],A very good trail for almost every skill level.  It gets a little steep for the last 1/2 mile.  The entire trail is very well maintained.
34,2018-08-17,['hiking'],"Steep in some areas and very over grown but a great hike none the less. Don’t expect to swim in the lake, it’s just for the doggos :)"
35,2018-07-25,['hiking'],Dog lake was a really nice hike. It wasn’t too long or too brutal and the lake itself is full of dogs..so how can you not enjoy that?! A little bit of a climb toward the end but nothing too crazy. Would do this again if I wanted a smaller hike.
36,2018-07-08,[''],"There was a lot of stinging nettle and large biting flies on the trail, and hiking on the road wasn’t so great. Dog lake was actually kind of gross and filled with 17 dogs. Other than that it was super nice!"
37,2018-07-01,[''],"Beautiful trail, but it is fairly steep.  At about 1.3 miles, is a nice spot to stop for lunch.  The wildflowers are in bloom and the breeze today was lovely."
38,2018-07-01,['hiking'],"Did this hike on 6/30. We started in the late afternoon. We passed a fair number of people at first that were on their way down, but there weren't too many after that. We were passes by 3 groups of mountain bikers. We had the lake to ourselves for almost an hour. This hike was very peaceful!

The moderate rating and distances seemed accurate. My wife and I were in the mood for a less strenuous hike and this was perfect for taking our time and looking at all the wild flowers, birds, and critters. 

There are amazing views of the mountains near the beginning of the hike. Follows a stream part of the way and features manypine and Aspen trees. The trees provide quite a bit of shade.

The lake was nice, but not the most beautiful I have seen. There were lots of bugs near the lake, but they didn't bother us much."
39,2018-06-25,[''],Really enjoyed this hike! Easy until the fork and then pretty steep the last .5 up to the lake. The weather was perfect and I only needed a long sleeve shirt. A few mountain bikers on the trail to make sure you’re paying attention while hiking.
40,2018-06-20,['hiking'],"We hiked to the lake on a beautiful sunny day. The gate in Mill Creek was still closed, so we didn't see anyone when we arrived. The water level is low for this time of year. The view on the way down was spectacular as the air was completely haze free."
41,2018-06-11,['hiking'],"My husband, 6 y/o son and I did this hike today. It took us less than 4.5 hours to finish and that is with us having lunch at Dog Lake. The views and scenery are just so beautiful. It is a lot of incline heading up but makes for an easy hike down. We loved this hike. Friendly people and a peaceful nature hike. Today, the weather was chilly and in the 40s, no mud on the trail at all."
42,2018-05-27,['hiking'],Perfect weather yesterday for hiking. Wore tank top and only light breeze at the lake that made it a bit cooler. Hardly snow (none on trail) so no mud
43,2018-05-18,['hiking'],"The trail was great! About an hour in we hit snow. It’s melting so it’s just mud. Couple more warm days and it should be gone! I thought the lake was going to be bigger, a little disappointed."
44,2018-01-13,['snowshoeing'],Went this morning! Great views! Lots of snow! (The first half of the trail is a little muddy but the rest is covered)
45,2018-01-11,['hiking'],"Nice trail, I saw a huge animal similar a moose!! Was very nice! The trail is not so steep, a lot of snow, the lake is snow, now... And... That’s it!"
46,2018-01-07,['hiking'],Great hiking trail in the winter. Crampons or spikes highly recommended
47,2018-01-05,['snowshoeing'],Love this hike in the winter. Dog Lake it best seen covered with snow.
48,2017-12-29,['hiking'],"Medium hike with moderate incline. The last quarter mile up to the lake gets steep but it doesn’t last long. Families with children wouldn’t find the trail too difficult. Cute lake at the end. Frozen in the winter but probably a nice place for a picnic in the summer.

There is a trail marker half a mile before the lake that indicates a trail split. You could hike to Desolation Lake at the split."
49,2017-10-16,['hiking'],"Great trail, but a bit of snow and ice the last 1/4 mile or so made it a bit slippery.  

Friendly reminder that no dogs are allowed in BCC!  There is a sign at the trailhead and another when you head back down towards Mill D. We passed several!  :("
50,2017-10-04,[''],"This is such a lovely hike. Some of the fall foliage is already gone, unfortunately, so part of the trail is a little barren-looking, but most of it is beautiful regardless. There was a fair bit of snow once we hit the last half a mile or so, and we -- along with a few other hikers -- all heard what we thought was a Mama bear and her baby, but, other than that, it was a lovely hike. I'd consider this a moderate level: the last mile -- particularly the last half -- gets a little steep (not terribly so, but enough to get your heart rate up)."
51,2017-08-24,['hiking'],Pretty easy group hike with Cotopaxi hiking club. The trail earns its moderate rating from the steep 0.5 mile at the end. Pretty flowers and some deer on the way up.
52,2017-08-09,['hiking'],"Tough going in the snow, you need to really want to see it.  We did see a moose up there."
53,2017-07-24,[''],We went a couple weeks ago and it was a great time!
54,2017-07-16,['hiking'],"The hike itself was beautiful, if a little more than two relatively out of shape students should have attempted - the wildflowers were absolutely gorgeous, and there were tons of quaking aspen that ought to be lovely in the fall as well.  The lake...well, despite the Mill D side saying no dogs, apparently the millcreek canyon trail to the lake DOES allow dogs, meaning that basically everyone at the lake had at least one dog with them.  As a result, the lake surroundings were stunning but the lake itself was totally muddy and kinda gross."
55,2017-06-26,[''],Definitely a bit steep the last .5 mile. It was a peaceful morning at the lake since the Millcreek side isn't open yet. It is really green and saw a lot of butterflies.
56,2017-06-24,[''],Very pretty and green along the entire trail.  Heard a woodpecker and saw a lot of butterflies.  Last half mile was steep.
57,2017-06-18,[''],Last half a mile is a little steep. We hiked in the evening and saw 6 moose. A couple were a little close for comfort. Snow is nearly all gone.
58,2017-06-16,['hiking'],"Shorter hike but nice incline here and there. Nice and green the entire way up.  A little snow here and there up top, but lake is clear of slush."
59,2017-06-05,['hiking'],Fun and easy. Good incline last 1/4 mile.
60,2017-06-04,[''],beautiful in the fall when the leaves are changing.
61,2017-06-04,[''],"Still some snow on the last part of the trail, but the lake is beautiful!"
62,2017-05-30,['backpacking'],Nice shorter hike. The last half mile is a little steeper and still mostly in snow pack. Dog Lake is just beginning to thaw.
63,2017-05-24,['hiking'],"What a beautiful hike! Easy, short and absolutely gorgeous, slushy lake! Snow packed but very doable with just our hiking boots."
64,2017-05-06,['hiking'],Still snow 1.8mi up.
65,2017-04-20,[''],"The last mile was snow packed, but didn't have any problems sinking in the snow."
66,2017-02-23,[''],Love it. Big bang for the buck. Not too crowded except in winter when skiers traverse it.
67,2016-12-04,['snowshoeing'],"THE SNOW IS HERE! Great snowshoeing, the trail is a little packed, but still a great experience, especially for a first timer! Watch out plenty of cross country skiers on the trail!"
68,2016-11-25,['hiking'],"Nothing too difficult at all, lots of deep snow this time of year. It was mostly packed down from others on the way up. Will do it again when it's not frozen over!"
69,2016-10-23,[''],This was a hard one for me as I don't hike much the snow and was difficult and slippery coming down and going up but this hike was worth it and was one amazing view.
70,2016-10-01,['hiking'],"I had planned on doing an easy hike, but accidentally pulled off the road a bit earlier than I should have. This hike was really beautiful, the leaves had changed and the first 2 miles was a steady incline but the last half mile was a little more difficult. It was a great hike even though not the one I originally wanted. I saw 3 deer on the way down."
71,2016-08-14,[''],"One of my favorites, mellow with a little steeper section at the end. Easy and quick pit and back when you don't have much time"
72,2016-08-07,['hiking'],it was a great hike in. came across some moose on the left side of the trail on the hike in. saw signs of bear activity in the area with some skat but other than that decent hike. My 7 year old was able to complete it with a few stops on the way of course
73,2016-08-06,[''],"The place was absolutely beautiful, there was just over populated with flies and they would get on you, we had to stop because it was bothering my partner. People put poop bags on the floor which I'm assuming the cause of flies."
74,2016-07-31,[''],Beautiful hike with a gentle incline most of the way. My hiking partner needed to rest a little throughout the last half mile - it gets steeper. We started the trail around 545am and we could hear the flies but they were not a nuisance that early in the day. Excited to hike the Butler Fork route to this little lake sometime soon.
75,2016-07-17,['hiking'],"This is such a pretty hike. There were wildflowers in bloom all along the trail. The last .5 mile or so after the junction for the Desolation trail is the steepest part of the trail. The lake isn’t very big and the closer I got to it, the more annoying the flies became. But it was nice to sit on a log in the shade overlooking the lake and have a snack before heading back down."
76,2016-07-15,['hiking'],"Such a beautiful trail with a fair amount of wildflowers, aspens, the sound of a stream most of the way...and many, many bugs (none of them biting, fortunately, just TONS of flies). The trail gets quite a bit of sun between about 10:00am and 3:00pm in the summer, but is perfect for early morning and late afternoon and evening. It's a consistent uphill climb, so you will certainly feel like you're getting your exercise!"
77,2016-07-15,['hiking'],"The hike was nice, and got steep towards the top. The lake was underwhelming. I had been there going a different way last year and remember enjoying the lake more. I think since we were the only ones there it made a difference. Last time I went I was with someone who had dogs and there were already dogs in the lake so I think it made it more fun."
78,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Great hike.  We started from the lower portion of Big Water Trail. It is a little further, but moderate grade and wide trail.  Lots of dogs going and coming, so plenty of opportunity for dog socialization.  Nice lake at the end where the dogs can enjoy a cool dip.  It was a good 2 1/2 hour hike for us and we kept moving pretty good.  Depending upon your physical condition and your dog, you might want to plan for 3 hours.  Definitely worth the drive to the top of Mill Creek Canyon!"
79,2016-06-27,['hiking'],Awesome hike. Pretty steep at the end but a good challenge!!
80,2016-06-23,[''],Dog lake is a great trail. There are beautiful wildflowers in the spring and the lake is also great. It only takes about two hours round trip.
81,2016-06-21,['hiking'],"Great hike, beautiful all the way. The last half mile will test your cardio. 
Keep your dog at home unless doing the Millcreek side or you got a grand to spend"
82,2016-06-18,[''],The trail is absolutely beautiful. Not too steep except for the last 1/2 mile. Went on a saturday afternoon and ran into a lot of hikers and bikers.
83,2016-06-17,['hiking'],"When I lived in the area my dog and I would trek up there a couple times each summer. Even if you don't make it to the end it's a gorgeous hike, lots of shade, great over looks. Bring a lunch, bring wading shorts, and have fun!"
84,2016-06-17,['hiking'],"The trail up to the fork between Dog Lake & Desolation Lake is very nice. It offers partial shade, a beautiful creek  and the climb is more gradual than many of the other trails in the area. Once you reach the fork, take the path on the left toward Dog Lake. It's not much further to the lake from here, but the trail does get steeper."
