1,2019-08-05,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! Hiked mid day on a Monday with my dog and didn’t see a single person.

4,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"Nice easy hike up to a peaceful lake. A few people. Not many bugs, but bug spray worked well."
5,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Took my 12 and 9 yr old boys up this. Beautiful hike, nice, small rewarding lake at the end with ample opportunity to view Whiskey creek as it cascades down the mountain."
6,2019-07-05,"['hiking', 'bugs']","This was a fun, relatively easy hike (It is mostly uphill, but at a low grade.) There are plenty of spots to stop and rest, and Whiskey Creek has many small rapids to look at and enjoy. I'd recommend this hike to anybody looking for a short but fun hike with a scenic reward at the end. (For all levels and ages of hikers too, we passed a family with a few young kids who had been backpacking up there all week.)

For the fishermen: Only one of my group packed a rod up, and we caught 2 small brook trout within 30 minutes."

10,2017-08-26,['hiking'],I clocked this as 2.7miles. That was just to the edge of the lake and back. This was a really peaceful hike. I didn't see anyone on the way up. Only one couple was camping at the far side of the lake. On the way down I saw 2 groups and this was by noon. So if you go in the morning I think you will miss most people. Or maybe I just got lucky. The trail is very well maintained and easy to follow. Would totally do this one again.

12,2017-06-23,['hiking'],Just went on 6/23/17. Snow is all cleared out and not much mud at all. It was an awesome little hike for the day. There were more switchbacks and it was steeper than I expected but overall a pretty easy hike. The lake is beautiful especially with the tall cliff right against it. There is also another un-named lake right before you get to Bourbon that is worth exploring.
13,2017-06-17,['hiking'],beautiful hike. still a few patches of snow and large puddles in june.  note that the trail has been reconstructed and moved out of the outlet drainage.  follow the arrows.
14,2016-08-16,['fishing'],Beautiful trail and fun fly fishing for small Brooke trout.
15,2016-08-01,['camping'],Great trail and lake to teach young kids how to hike and camp.  The trail is easy and short.
16,2016-06-28,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail. Even though it was a weekend , there was only one person on the trail.
