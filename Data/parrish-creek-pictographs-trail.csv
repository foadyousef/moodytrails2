1,2019-08-30,['hiking'],Wonderful quick little hike! very well shaded after the first half mile. Just be careful hiking up in these mountains for the next couple days. There is a wildfire up in these mountain just over a mile south from the start of the trail. Be careful and be safe!
2,2019-08-17,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Is shady but I think if you go early very short and beautiful highly recommended 
3,2019-08-13,['hiking'],Couldn't find the pictographs. Someone said they had been painted over. 
4,2019-08-11,['hiking'],The trail should be listed as hard.  We got to this rock outcropping and the trail involves a Little Rock climbing.  We didn’t go on.  I did see a rattle snake under the red bridge.  And the poison ivy should be contained but is not.  Just be mindful as you hike this trail.
5,2019-08-04,['hiking'],easy in easy out waterfall success. 
6,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"hard to figure out what direction to go. I'm sure the trail gets better past the bridge, but there are no markers telling you to turn right after crossing it."

8,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'scramble', 'washed out']","LARGE AMOUNT of POISON IVY growing in the trail. Really, right in the middle of the trail. High water and overgrown plants make finding the trail and finishing the hike very difficult. Get to the first waterfall easily "
9,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'over grown']","It was dusty but beautiful. I made it up with my kids (ages 9, 7, 5, & 9 months in a pack)but the younger kids had to go back down parts of the dusty trail on their bums so they didn't slip. The water felt great though, we played in it a lot. There was some poison ivy along the trail for a second but easily spotted and avoided. Definitely go up the creek along the rocks when you get close to the pictographs. it's easier and feels good to get wet!"
10,2019-07-13,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","This hike is short, but has a couple of pieces you really need to be aware of before going. Once you turn right after the bridge, the trail isn’t super stable. It’s loose dirt the rest of the way, and angled/steep enough that you need to watch your footwork. On the way back I had to crouch and slide at the steeper parts because the dirt will just slide out from under your feet. At the end of the trail to get to the pictographs I saw only two options- scale the rock by the creek, or a scramble across the rocks above. I chose to scramble the rocks, which wasn’t terrible on the way over to the pictographs. On the way back, however, the scramble is VERY sketchy and took me some time to navigate safely. If you know what you’re in for and confident in your skills it’s not a huge deal, but I wouldn’t recommend trying to get small children across. As an experienced hiker who often hikes alone, I figured this would be a no brainer, but it’s more challenging than at first glance. The pictographs are really cool, and unusual for the area, so this is a unique chance to see that piece of history. Know what you’re in for and you’ll love this hike. "

Theres a Quick Video of what the area looks like!
Great hike I always love taking this brisk hike up to enjoy the View and to see some heritage of the Natives in the area!"
12,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'scramble']","Trail okay. Quick hike, but not easy as it is a scramble. I wouldn’t recommend for little kids, unless in a backpack like we had. However, the last scramble to the rock art couldn’t be done safety with the backpack. Creek is full and quick moving. "
13,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'scramble']","I love any trail with a creek, some shade, and a waterfall! That said, a couple of pointers: we were thinking of this as a trail for kids but there are some points where you scramble, some points where the trail falls away or there is loose gravel or rocks sticking up. So keep your eye on kids. Also, if you are not watching, it is easy to accidentally go up the Parrish Zig Zag trail."
14,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'washed out']","I think giving this trail two stars is only generous. The trail starting out has a bit of gain to it and some areas where it mellows out. However, as soon as your cross the red wooden bridge and the trail to the right starts to the petroglyphs. The creek is still flowing decently and there is some areas where it crosses over onto the trail. This trail is also littered with poison ivy. It is very difficult to avoid even touching it. Don't bring your dogs passed this point unless you want them bringing poison ivy home. Also, unusual for it to grow here in such direct sunlight. The trail at this point passed the bridge I think is difficult. One can easily slide off the trail and into the creek bed below, pick up some poison ivy while you fall down too. You need good hiking shoes and take your time. If interested in seeing the petroglyphs go on ahead, otherwise find a different trail to enjoy."
15,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'washed out']",The river is full so we had to precariously climb across rocks to get to the pictographs. The water is right up to the trail.
16,2019-06-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'scramble', 'washed out']","This is a fun, easy, quick hike. I usually really like it, but the stream is just too full right now. It is almost impossible to make the scramble up to the pictographs because that water is too high and the rocks are too mossy to find footing. "
17,2019-06-02,[''],"The trail was good up to the photographs, but at that point, the trail seemed to switch to the other side of the creek, and the creek was too full to cross easily. So we checked out the glyphs and turned around."
18,2019-05-20,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'washed out']",I’d recommend doing this trail in fall. It’s pretty in the spring but the river was overflowing and we weren’t able to do the whole thing as a result. It was very pretty lots of trees 
19,2019-05-11,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Great little trail. Narrow and steep in parts and currently the river/stream is high enough crossing after the pictographs is pretty sketchy.
20,2019-04-26,['hiking'],Well worth the hike it’s pretty steep in some places! Super cool little trail!
21,2019-04-24,['hiking'],"We had a great time on this trail tonight.  High 60’s, trees blooming, a beautiful creek to follow half way in.  The waterfall is really roaring right now.  So pretty!  Like others have said, keep going past the waterfall over some steep, tricky terrain.  Right now the water is running high, so you’ll need to get your feet wet if you want to climb up to see the petroglyphs which are up on the left under an overhang.  This was fine for our 16 and 9 year olds, but our 13 and 10 year olds with autism chose to see them from afar (You can if you know where to look).  If you’re hiking with kids, this is a two-adult trail since there are some narrow and tricky sections.  Didn’t see any poison ivy.  The petroglyphs are awesome!  So fun to think of a group of Fremont teens sitting in this cool spot leaving their mark!"
22,2019-04-07,['hiking'],"Quaint little trail. Did this instead of Adams Canyon trail. It was closed as a search and rescue effort was going on, don’t know the details but be safe out there people! Went up the trail to the south of this one, got up pretty high then turned around, it goes way past where it shows it ends."
23,2018-10-28,['hiking'],"For such a short hike, this was a good workout. Like other hikers have mentioned, the trail is narrow, rocky and steep in places. Also, it has lots of poison ivy, so I recommend wearing long pants. But, the scenery is beautiful, and the pictographs definitely make it worth it."
24,2018-09-22,['hiking'],"THERE IS POISON IVY EVERYWHERE! I'm surprised no one has mentioned this, especially in a hike rated only ""moderate"" and OK for at least older kids. We are experienced hikers, so I'm not giving it the half-hearted rating lightly. Also, I realize going in mid-September gave the trail a chance to really dry out and the poison ivy time to grow into large stands, but really, this warrants a mention. The trail to the bridge is decent with a lot of the elevation gained and then lost before you get to the red Bridge. After that, a lot of it is extremely narrow and steep (like a few degrees away from needing technical climbing gear. It gets very bad as you approach the second waterfall (which is not as picturesque in September as it probably was earlier in the year). Also, are the petroglyph closer to the upper waterfall than the map suggests? We got to the upper waterfall without seeing them, although it's only there that you see a rock face of the sort that you get petroglyphs on. At that point, though, the trail was so narrow and difficult to negotiate, we weren't looking up too much because a fall or slide would have landed us in a lush stand of poison ivy. At least on Bonneville Shoreline someone marks it. Our beef is less with the trail than with the really less-than-adequate description here."
25,2018-09-08,[''],Trail can be slipper. Take the trail on the left of the bridge. Don’t cross the bridge. A lot to see on this hike. Loved it!
26,2018-09-01,[''],Easy walk and some neat pictographs.  There seems to be some churn with understanding where to go.  Follow the AllTrails path and once you get to the first small water fall keep going.  The trail runs to the right of the creek and will eventually lead you right to the pictographs.  Just keep swimming!
27,2018-07-25,[''],"Beautiful hike but the path is very unclear at many points and is not good for kids, especially in a baby carrier as you need to balance and use your arms multiple times. Otherwise the hike is the perfect distance and mostly in the shade :)"
28,2018-07-16,[''],"This is a great hike. Just remember you are following a creek up the canyon, not going straight up the mountain. There is a sign that points to the trail going up the mountain but this trail turns left at that point and starts going down into the canyon to the red bridge. Our kids loved it. There are some steep places, not dangerous but have to slide down a little bit. The water is cold and refreshing."
29,2018-07-05,[''],"My husband and I completed this hike on July 1. 

The AllTrails map is accurate in terms of getting you to the trailhead and starting you on the trail. 

However, there must have been some error, because it led us way too far past the petroglyphs. We had never done this trail, and we walked past the glyphs without noticing them, just going off the app's guidance.  We hiked way deeper into the canyon and through some very sketchy obstacles.  We finally decided to turn around because it was getting too dangerous, even though we hadn't found the glyphs. On the way back, we finally found them.

For those doing this trail.... the glyphs are on the left side as you're hiking up the waterfall area. They are at at a slightly higher elevation than the trail. 

Not sure why the app didn't work for us. I think we would have had a better time if we hadn't exhausted ourselves going so far past the glyphs. Be careful, everyone!"
30,2018-07-02,[''],"This is a nice little trail, but not a kid friendly trail. I never want to take a toddler here again. Up to the bridge, it's okay for 5 and up. Past the bridge, no one younger than 12 or so."
31,2018-07-02,[''],The trail was great but the directions weren’t. Make sure to head left once you meet up with the main trail. At the end of the red bridge turn right and head up the mountain. It took me a couple attempts to actually find it.
32,2018-06-23,['hiking'],"The pictographs were interesting, Didn't know there were some so close to home"
33,2018-06-09,[''],"Not well marked
We climbed for almost an hour and followed a few different sets of directions and we're disappointed to still never find the site, but it was a beautiful hike nonetheless."
34,2018-05-19,['hiking'],Easy hike along the creek. A couple of small waterfalls and the pictographs are cool. Some areas are steep and to get to the pictographs is a little bit of climbing over rocks. Walking down back to the parking area was a little tough cause of sliding on the trail but still an easy hike.
35,2018-05-19,[''],Nice moderate hike as described
36,2018-04-16,[''],"Nice hike along a waterfall, be careful it’s easy to fall in! Wish there were more pictographs."
37,2017-08-21,['hiking'],I might say this is easy but there are enough steep and narrow sections to say moderate. Is short so it doesn't take much but wouldn't be easy for little kids. I am always amazed anytime I am in the presence of pictographs.
38,2017-07-27,['hiking'],"This was a fun little hike. The app took me to the wrong starting place though. I looked at the map and found the real starting spot over 2 streets. This is a nice quick hike that is great for an afternoon hike. Once you get in the canyon, is pretty shaded. I will do this hike again. My 4 year old liked the Petroglyphs!"
39,2017-07-14,['hiking'],"Please, don't touch the petroglyphs. DO NOT TOUCH THE PETROGLYPHS. They have faded tremendously since i was last up there they are irreplaceable and spectacular. Thank You,"
40,2017-06-28,['hiking'],"Hike with my kids a few times a week and they do pretty well on most moderate hikes. They are ages 6,4 and 1(rides in the pack).  We tried this hike due to the kid friendly review we found on all trails.  I did not find it kid friendly whatsoever.  Trail is narrow, slick and we almost lost a few kids in the river.  Fine for adults, but I wouldn't do it again."
41,2017-06-28,[''],"The trail isn't well marked. Another hiker guided us at the start. Much of the trail is full sun. Take PLENTY of water. We saw lots of lizards and a snake. The waterfall is pretty and shaded, but the trail is super narrow and steep. Kids could easily slide off, and it would be a rocky, dangerous fall. I took my teen. So glad I didn't bring my 4-year-old. Once was enough for this hike. We've enjoyed other hikes more. We never did see the petroglyphs. Maybe they were at the very top? We were afraid of sliding off the trail, so we stopped. Maybe there's another trail? Our trail was on the north side of the falls, and we were probably 3/4 of the way to the top."
42,2017-06-21,[''],"Requires so careful foot work, but the petroglyphs are way cool at the end!!! The waterfall is gorgeous"
43,2017-06-12,['hiking'],Went with all the kids and a newbie hiker. Scared the newbie with the fast water. Good to do with other adults if bringing kids. Cool petroglyphs and fun scramble at the end!
44,2017-06-01,[''],"fun hike,  went wrong way first.  Snake, fox and squirls on this hike."
45,2017-05-29,[''],"Trail was beautiful! Pretty flowers and waterfalls. Water level was high though, so if you want to see the Petroglyphs up close you will get wet."
46,2017-03-18,[''],Took the wrong trail. Ended up on the top of the mountain instead of seeing a waterfall. It was a little steep but overall a nice hike.
47,2016-10-19,['hiking'],"This is a fun and scenic trail with a big payoff at the end. Also not very busy, which I like!

It branches off from the Shoreline Trail in Davis county, so there's a couple different ways into the canyon. I usually drive all the way up Parrish Lane and park in a small dirt lot close to the reservoir. From the lot you can reach this trail by heading directly up the hill above parking (choosing left forks as you continue, which will get you in the canyon), or go north on Shoreline Trail (also following it into the canyon). You'll begin loosely following Parrish Creek, eventually reaching a red bridge that connects trails on either side of the canyon. There's a small trail connecting to the north side of the bridge that continues deeper into the canyon (shown in picture). This closely follows the creek, gets very narrow in spots but is overall easy to follow. You'll eventually reach a rock scramble—easy to do if you take the right side—and on top are the Petroglyphs, marked with a sign.

The trial continues further past the Petroglyphs, but does get increasingly difficult and dangerous as you go (slippery rocks, multiple creek bed crossings, rock scrambles required) but is an awesome trail if you want to explore further."
