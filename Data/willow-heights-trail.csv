0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],"What a great hike! The aspen trees kept the majority of the hike in shade, which was cool and refreshing. The loop around the lake was slightly overgrown, but still easy to follow. The view from the meadow was by far the best part of the hike! I would definitely recommend it.",
1,2019-09-07,['hiking'],Perfect if you love aspens. Saw 2 Moosen.,
2,2019-09-07,['hiking'],"WARNING!!!!   Today (7 Sep. 2019) I saw a mountain lion coming from the willows on the northeast corner of the lake at 4:45 pm,  not the time you would normally expect to see one. I was about 50 yards away. He may have been hunting deer in the willows, and/or have a kill in there, in which case he will be back.  There were also 3 moose. Two cows in the trees by the northeast corner backside, and a bull drinking from the stream right below the lake going down the west trail.",

4,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, some parts a little more moderate difficulty and just as you think of going back with the two toddlers you carried you keep going and the view is so worth it! Cute little ducks! Loved it! ",
5,2019-08-31,['hiking'],"Great short hike. Took my husband and kids (13,11,5) The best part of the trail is around the northeast side of the lake when it opens up into an enclosed meadow. Really beautiful. Didn’t see any wildlife other than a snake. ",
6,2019-08-31,['hiking'],Great hike! We enjoyed the flowers and crossing the babbling streams. The lake may be smaller but it is beautiful to look at and fun to watch the ducks diving for food. The aspens on either side of you stand as majestic sentinels providing you protection from the sun rays throughout the hike. The left is less steep for those who want to take it a little easier.,
7,2019-08-31,['hiking'],"Ok hike. A small, moderate uphill, pretty wildflowers and Aspens on the way, occasional shade, but the lake was more of a pond. Our 5 year old made the whole trip no problem.",
8,2019-08-28,['hiking'],"Beautiful, quiet trail. Go left when the trail forks for an easier ascent. Had a baby and a toddler with me and definitely found the climb harder than expected - but worth it!! The lake is small but stunning. Such a peaceful hike. Definitely coming back.",
9,2019-08-26,['hiking'],"Great hike! I think rating it as ""Easy"" is not entirely accurate. It wasn't a really long hike, but it DID have a decent uphill slope in some places. Still, absolutely worth it.",
10,2019-08-26,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Parking is on the road either side. Pretty trail with plenty of shade for a hot afternoon. The first bit is pretty steep but you hit the lake before you know it. It’s a rocky way down so be careful on your ankles and take it slow. Took about 60 minutes going leisurely. ,
11,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Beautiful place to go hiking, it is moderate not easy. My family and I enjoyed the peace while it lasted until we witnessed a woman and three children playing in Willow Lake. Huge bummer that they violated the biggest rule, no swimming. 
Please protect our watershed, do not swim in any body of water at Big or Small Cottonwood Canyon. Thank you!",
12,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Great trail. But be warned, it’s more moderate than easy as the first leg of the trail is all uphill. It’s not bad. I took my kids and had a good trip. I would take the fork to the left going up because the one to the right is steeper and rockier",
13,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"This was a beautiful place to backpack into for the night. The trail is a very consistent upward climb, and it definitely got me sucking wind, so keep that in mind if you’re not in the best shape. I’d rate it as moderate-difficult. You’ll be crossing water a few times and going over rocks or fallen logs There are lots of places to set up camp when you get there. It’s a beautiful meadow and it was breathtaking to wake up to. We saw a whole family of moose when we woke up playing in the water! (Bull, cow, and two calves). ",

15,2019-08-24,['hiking'],Great hike. Followed a slightly overgrown spur trail off the northwest apex of the lake loop. Took me steeply up to the top of a grassy knob with great views.,
16,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"Lovely hike with amazing wildflowers and wildlife, including deer, birds, moose, and even a badger. I also hiked a spur trail that extended northwest off the apex of the Willow Heights Trail. It was a steep scramble up to the top of a grassy knob with excellent views of the surrounding mountains. Worth it but a pole would have been helpful.",
17,2019-08-21,['hiking'],"This was pretty! Definitely go left when it forks on the way up then we came down the rocky way. The right way is really steep and rocks all on the trail. It was a beautiful hike! Right when I thought I had enough, the lake was suddenly there! Perfect timing! There were ducks and baby ducklings - morning light shining on the lake- really gorgeous!",
18,2019-08-21,['hiking'],"It was a little harder then I anticipated, but I’m also out of shape. It was a beautiful hike. It’s worth it getting to the top. ",
19,2019-08-18,['hiking'],Had to stop and breathe a few times. Lots if wild flowers. small lake/pond this time of year. Saw two moose on the way back down. Fun morning!,
20,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Pretty good hike. Had to stop a few times to catch our breath from it being steep on the way up. Not really a ""lake"" at the top but more like a small pond with ducks swimming all around. Enjoyed it though and would do it again.",
21,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'bugs']","parts are a bit washed out, and a out 60/40 shade sun. great little lake as a reward. shore is packed with bugs though.",
22,2019-08-18,['hiking'],The trail forks at the beginning. The right trail is super rocky and steep. The left trail is flat and steep. It’s a good trail for kids though. We saw a coyote and some ducks. The lake is more like a large pond. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. ,
23,2019-08-17,['backpacking'],Great trail for beginner hikers. The first 1/3 of the trail is a little steep for the little ones but then it flattens out. The river crossings in August were easy as most of the water has dried up. Up above the lake was all dry stream beds. Way less water than when I did it in June. Saw 2 moose on the trail and so we went the other way around the lake.,
24,2019-08-14,['hiking'],Short but sweet! Great for a quick after work hike. Love the views of Honeycomb Cliffs from the meadow. Saw a moose right on the trail tonight. Glad he snorted or else I would have totally bumped into him.,
25,2019-08-12,['hiking'],This is a good hike with kids! We saw two moose. It was shaded about 60% of the time! I would do it again. ,
26,2019-08-12,"['hiking', 'rocky']",From the reviews I was expecting more shade. It was decently shady on the way up but not entirely shady. Still very pretty walk though we missed out on the wildflowers which were mostly dying out this weekend. We did see the ducks and baby ducklings which were cute. my 3 year old hiked the whole way carrying his own water but he did get tired on the way down and slipped a few times on the out though that may be due to his needing shoes with more grip. All in all a very nice hike for a Sunday afternoon. ,
27,2019-08-08,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! Did this one with my 6, 8,11, and 15 year old. it is an incline most of the whole way, but mostly shaded. lots of wildflowers. you do cross the little river a few different times! Once you get closer to the top, it opens up into a beautiful field just before the lake. Turn around and you can see the so much. We saw a huge moose that didnt seem to care we were there. Besides the incline, I loved everything about this hike! breathtaking views! ",
28,2019-08-06,['hiking'],"1 adult and 6 kids ages 4-10 did it in under 2 hours (and a 3 year old who walked part of the time). It was beautiful,  mostly shady and a good amount of incline so you get a workout,  but not too terrible for little ones. had a few bites or stings,  but still worth the beautiful hike. ",
29,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs']","My wife, 2 year old and I did this trail today. Our two year hiked maybe halfway up on her own and probably would of been able to hike the entire trail if she wasn’t grumpy from hunger and if she didn’t trip on a rock.  The trail is mostly through dense trees with a few small creeks that you have to cross. Near the top there is a large open field where you lose the shade right before you get to the lake. At the lake there is little to no shade around the lake so you are completely exposed to the heat. We found a little shaded area probably 200 yards away the lake that we enjoyed. Overall the hike was pretty easy except for when we had to carry our daughter and the views at the top near the lake were great. This is a hike I’d recommend you wear lots of bug spray and reapply once your at the top. We saw a badger and several squirrels, not too many birds. ",
30,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs']",did this trail carrying my 1 year old and my 4 year old did it completely on his own. it is consistently inclined so I felt the burn in my not so fit calves but this hike was one of the favorites! the whole hike was shaded until you get to the open meadow right before the lake. views that will make you want to run through the meadow singing the sound of music. wildflowers are in bloom and gorgeous. we will. e coming back in fall to see all the colors it's going to have!,

34,2019-08-03,['hiking'],Excellent hike through Aspens and wildflowers. Getting to the lake is mostly up hill but not too bad. Once you get to the “y” it is flat all the way around the lake and through another grove of aspens. Spotted a young bull mouse on this past Thursday ,
35,2019-08-03,['hiking'],Beautiful hike through aspens.  Lots of wildflowers.  Many cute ducklings.,
36,2019-08-03,['hiking'],Great trail! Quite a bit of shade. Pretty lake and lots of nice trees and flowers. A bit steep on one portion of the loop but otherwise not too bad. Definitely would do again.,
37,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Beautiful area. Lots of wildflowers. Be sure to complete the entire loop. Lots of mosquitoes and deer fly. Wear long pants and long sleeves.,
38,2019-08-01,"['hiking', 'bugs']",,
39,2019-07-30,['hiking'],"Wow so fun. Easy trail with some upticks. So many wildflowers right now. Oh, we saw a momma moose and her valve on the trail so we waited a few minutes while they headed off into the forest. We also saw her on the way back down from the creek. What a great hike",
40,2019-07-30,"['hiking', 'bugs']","7/23/19– Beautiful trail, perfect mid point weather. Some cloud cover but mostly sunny, wasn’t too hot around 12pm. I would rate this more moderate seeing as it is steeper than expected in some parts. We weren’t lucky enough to see a moose, but we saw plenty of butterflies and pot guts! Got a few horse fly/deer fly bites. There were a lot of pesky bugs that wouldn’t leave us alone. 

The lake loop itself was serene and beautiful! Wildflowers are abundant in many varieties and colors this time of year! Definitely would do it again!",

42,2019-07-29,['hiking'],Beautiful hike this morning but giant moose about 10 feet off trail right as we started. Wanted to give some space. May head up in a little. Beautiful weather ,
43,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Went up today. Lots of wildflowers and butterflies. Really pretty. We missed the moose, but heard from other hikers that there was a mom and calf near the lake. ",
44,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",Awesome hike. We saw two bull moose today and millions of butterflies. The flowers are great and most the hike is well shaded. Ten ducklings and there mama also owned the lake today. They swam right up to my seven year old totally fearless.,
45,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"This trail was amazing. Wild flowers the entire way up and down and a gorgeous meadow with amazing views. It rained on us a little bit at the lake but no downpour. We saw two moose off the trail. Gorgeous aspens and the trail is so lush and the flowers and weeds are very tall. Very fun, even for my 5 and 2 year old. Highly recommend! ",
46,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"My new favorite hike. Absolutely beautiful, not too hot, wildflowers are out. Lots of annoying biting flies but the breathtaking views are worth it. We took a group of kiddos and they did great. We saw a snake, some friendly ground squirrels(?), ducks, and butterflies. No moose. but other hikers we passed saw a momma and baby, and another hiker saw a bull today. The kids got tired, dirty, and out in nature. We all loved it!",
47,2019-07-25,['hiking'],Great loop hike that’s short & steep. The wildflowers are stellar right now!,
48,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'bugs']","A little buggy, but such a beautiful trail. Short, but a little steep.",
49,2019-07-24,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful hike. Wildflowers in bloom and the whole hike was lush green. We came across 3 moose - two cows and a baby. We kept our distance and they didn’t seem too bothered by us. We actually ended up doing both sides of the trail because the moose was blocking our way up on the first one we took. The right fork is steeper with rocks along the trail and the canopy of trees protects you from the sun. The left fork is a little bit longer, not nearly as steep and it seemed like there were less bugs. Either way, the view is phenomenal, you can’t go wrong!",

51,2019-07-24,['hiking'],"The other day my brother and I went on a hike on the Willow Heights Trail. On the way up we went on the path to the right, it turned out to be rocky and a little challenging, but it wasn’t too bad. We got to the lake and took a short rest. We took the other path on the way down, it was a lot easier and it was kind of nice to cross the stream a couple times. We saw a moose a ways off the trail, it didn’t seem to pay any attention to us as we passed by. We also saw a few chipmunks or squirrels and lots of flowers. There were lots of flies which were annoying, but they were only really bad in a couple spots. It was nice to get out and away from the city. It felt refreshing to get out in nature and to be in the forest. I hope to go up again later in the year when the leaves are changing color. I had a good time and really enjoyed our hike. ",
52,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Great trail, beautiful wildflowers, saw a cow moose!",
53,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']",,
54,2019-07-18,['hiking'],"Please, if you go here, be moose aware. Don't let your small children wander around, and yes, it's nice to look at the lake, but be aware of what is behind you. 

I uploaded a picture of a bull  moose I saw yesterday. Yes, I look right next to the moose, but that's what zoom is for on cameras.  I've photographed hundreds of moose, all safely from a distance, and all from cover. Yesterday I also saw a couple examples of what NOT to do around a moose, that I see all too often when people see one.

When I got there I looked over to the opposite side of the lake, but the bull must have been just out of view behind the bushes to the northeast corner of the lake. I went around clockwise, and when I got around to the duck standing rock on the north side (which had a mother and her babies on it) I was going to take a picture and then noticed the bull browsing down the trail, just having come into view, as I went over the small rise in the middle of the north side of the lake.

I watched, photographed, and did video of him for about 20 minutes, hoping he would go down for a swim. The first bad example was two people who came around from the other direction. They kept slowly creeping closer, until I yelled they were probably getting too close. They then tried going up in the trees above the trail, but that spooked him and he ran off to the willows.

They were too close and totally exposed. They may not have known it, but from where the bull was eating, one normal place he would try to escape would be the corner of the willows, which were only feet from they were standing. With them standing there, he might go somewhere different (up into the trees) but he might be intent on getting to the willows. I yelled at them they were getting too close, which is when they went up to the trees (at least they had protection) but their noise of breaking brush and sticks in walking through there also spooked him.

The second bad example is that there was a family with small children at the northwest corner of the lake watching ducks, unaware that the bull was just over the small rise from them on north side of the lake. The mother and two children (probably about 3 and 5) came over to investigate when I yelled at the other couple they were too close. The kids were at least 60 feet in front of the mother, standing in the middle of the trail, also exposed. The mother seemed unconcerned and apparently told the kids to come back, and then she turned her back and walked away, leaving the kids standing there staring at the moose for at least another 10-15 seconds before they followed her. For all she knew, they could have walked on toward the moose.

This was while the other couple were in the trees trying to go around the moose, and making noise. I thought if he was spooked (which he was) that he would head to the willows, but you never know. He could just have easily have decided to run down the trail, where the small kids were (not seeing them as a threat), and the mother had turned her back on the moose (and her kids) and was walking away.

PLEASE, if you see a moose, the first thing is to find cover. They can run 35 mph. If you are exposed, they could be on top of you before you got a couple steps. Find a group of trees that they can't get between, and that you could maneuver around if necessary. Bulls are *normally* docile this time of year, just interested in eating, but by early September the rut will start, and may charge any random thing. This time of year a cow with a calf is more dangerous. If they look at you and stare, you are too close. If they continue what they were doing then you are probably a safe distance (behind cover).

Remember, you are in THEIR house. Don't get too close that you cause them to change what they were doing (eating or resting). If they change what they were doing, YOU ARE TOO CLOSE. Don't yell and wave your arms (as I have seen some people do) to get them to move off the trail so you can continue walking around the lake. Turn around and go back if you can't wait for them to move. The options for couple #1: (1) move safely up into the trees a distance from the moose, and quietly wait for the moose to finish eating and go which ever way he wants. Don't try to walk through all the brush and sticks to go around, as the noise will spook the moose (as they did). (#2) Turn around and walk 3/4 of the back around the lake they had just walked, if they couldn't wait for the moose to move. As for the mother with the small children, they should never have been 60 feet in front of her, and she should never have turned her back on the moose, especially leaving her kids just standing there staring.

If you see a moose, don't disturb them, or make them change what they were doing. Remain quiet, and photograph them safely from cover and a distance. ",
55,2019-07-17,['hiking'],"This was a gorgeous trail!  It was definitely steep at the beginning and the end for this flatlander family. Kid friendly for sure, our 11 & 7 year olds rocked it. There were a couple of awesome camping spots for anyone that wants to pack it in. It was absolutely beautiful all the way around, not just at the lake. We would do it again and even camp overnight there, or bring a couple of hammocks, a good book and have a picnic. ",
56,2019-07-17,['hiking'],"This hike is very pretty but the first part is steep! Even though it is fairly short in distance, I find the ascension to be pretty difficult. This is a great place for backpacking and camping or even just hammocking for a few hours. ",

58,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Great hike, especially for the younger kids. We took the trail to the right, and my 4 and 7 year old could climb the small boulders that were on the trail. It was a great trail to hike! ",
59,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Beautiful. Was easy for experienced hikers, a little steep grades and rocky terrain. So ones with health issues may not be able to go. Worth the hike for the views. ",
60,2019-07-12,['hiking'],"Was a good hike! Took a 5,10 and 12 year old. The right of the trail is quite steep and the 5 year old had some moments!! I would suggest going up and down the left side with kids. There are 2 fun river crossing points. Beautiful lake and great picnic view at the top! ",
61,2019-07-12,['hiking'],Easy doable hike. Saw moose,
62,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"Easy hike to do with a toddler in a backpack. When heading up the trail, stay to the left for a more gradual incline. Also, be careful of stinging nettle around the lake.",

64,2019-07-05,['hiking'],Great for toddlers and family time :),
65,2019-07-04,['hiking'],Go Left! Awesome trail and beautiful lake view.,
66,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"Took my three kids (4, 2.5, 7 months) by myself. It was doable but highly recommend staying right to start the hike. Going up the steep way is much easier than coming down (especially for the youngsters).

We took a break in the shade on the way up and then ate lunch up by the lake. There is a grove of trees with a campsite in them and a short trail leading up to them. Great lunch spot to overlook the lake and the rest of the scenery. 

We stayed right on the way down and came down the less steep route. It had two stream crossings that the kids loved. If your kids are as into throwing rocks into lakes/creeks as mine are I would say this isn’t the perfect hike. But it was definitely beautiful. ",

68,2019-07-03,['hiking'],Nice quick hike. Saw a squirrel. He kept to himself.,
69,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"Took the kids (16,13,11,9) yesterday, 7/1, on this beautiful hike.  We stumbled across a geocache near the trail sign that has a great poem about the history of the place.  Then there was a song strapped the big tree near where the trail splits also about “the Willow Patch.”  We opted to take the trail on the right and go up the steep way.  The scenery is SO GORGEOUS!  Aspen groves are heavenly, especially with a carpet of wildflowers underneath.  The view of Solitude before you get to the lake is amazing.  The lake itself is so-so with zero shade around it, but it does have some rocks for sitting on while you eat a snack.  We went down the less steep trail, and the kids liked the stream crossings.  I think the other side of the trail is prettier, but going down this way is easier on the knees.",
70,2019-07-02,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! It was fairly easy and pretty short will be coming here more! Ran into so much wild life and enjoyed every second of it.,
71,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, especially on a hot day (lots of shade). Fairly easy, except for the smallest of hikers. We had a 4-year-old in our group who we didn’t carry.

That trail I would say is a moderate hike. The ""lake"" is more like a larger pond. It was very serene and there was no one else there when I went on 6/25. ",
77,2019-06-26,['hiking'],beautiful hike. Aspen trees were beautiful. Lake kind of small. great views. I would call this moderate not easy. ,
78,2019-06-25,['hiking'],It is a beautiful hike but one of the trails is definitely not easy. There is a trail fork shortly after the start and the trail to the left is a lot easier but you have to cross the creek twice.

80,2019-06-24,['hiking'],Quite steep for an “easy hike”. Some stream crossings were tricky with the amount of water right now. But worth it for the views! ,
81,2019-06-24,['hiking'],We parked at the entrance to the neighborhood and cut through there to skip that first rocky part. Still kind of muddy but people have made some great log bridges to get off the little rivers and streams.,

If you're not use to high elevation, the 600 elevation gain from about 8,000 feet can be challenging. The trail forks and it isn't clearly marked how to loop around to the lake so I had to do some back tracking. Overall a pleasant trail that gives you a decent workout for a quick hike. ",
94,2019-06-01,"['muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']",This was a pretty nice trail. the left branch from the sheet music is very rocky and a pretty steep climb at first. Still a lot of snow in the forest near the top. We were post holing pretty much every three or four steps and the trail is you best guess at that point. The snow isn't quite as bad on the way back down the other side and ends shortly after the second stream crossing. Lake was pretty. Overall a nice hike but I would love to see it once the snow melts. It is one of the only lake trails we could find to do with so much snow at the higher elevations.,

The steep part of the trail (first quarter mile) was nicely packed, and I only used my crampons for one short steep section on the way down. that said, the flatter portions, particularly near the lake, were doable, but tough going with quite a bit of sinking in a few spots. If you have lightweight snowshoes, I recommend packing them up the hill and putting them on once things level out.",

I hiked without snowshoes because the trail was packed enough, but the incline did get slippery. Spikes or crampons probably would have been ideal. In the snow, the incline might be a little tricky for young kids. The mountain was beautiful and the hike was in the sun the entire time. No need for snow pants or snow jackets—just a few warm layers! The lake is completely covered in snow, so the real showstopper was the view of the resorts on the other side of the road! No wildlife (this time) but a few bunny tracks.",

Although it’s a quick hike up, it’s really steep. Basically no switch backs and just straight up. Even so, only takes around 20 minutes. Once you get to the lake (which is small), the view is beautiful. Lots of aspens and a good view of Solitude. The ducks here are friendly, they swam right over to me, I assume because they expected food. I also saw 2 huge moose, and I went around 1. Good hike if you’re looking for something quick and scenic.",

We went at about 5pm and came back down with very little light so we caught all the animals coming down for water. It was amazing!",

Somehow the alltrails gpx map (we did download it into gaia before going as the cell signal is weak here) doesn't show the last switchback on the left side of the trail (alltrails map doesn't show a true loop), and shows going over the river and going back down a part of the steep part. I'm a little surprised the alltrails map is not accurate as this trail is very well traveled. We got here at about 7am on a Sunday. There were several cars parked on the roadside, and several campers/hammock campers in the trail already. We rested at the top and enjoyed the scenery, so came down by 10am. The trail definitely got busy by this time.",

Trailhead is about 200 meters east of AJ Motion Sports, on the left (marked by an engraved rock). We parked next to the road on the gravel. When you reach the first fork in the trail, the trail on the right is pretty steep and continues on a steep incline for about 10-15 minutes. It eventually levels out, but it was definitely a workout. On the way back, you've got to pay attention to the GPS or you will most definitely miss the trail back (which is an off-shoot of the main trail).",

145,2018-07-21,[''],"The first 1/2 mile of the trail is very steep. I carry a couple of hiking poles and it helps me up these obstacles! You start with beautiful green bushes and wild flowers. You slowly immerse yourself in you aspen trees and it feels like you’re in a scary movie! Once you find yourself out of the woods, you get a breath of fresh air of just hills, mountains, and a gorgeous view! It’s so green! You’d think you’re in England seeing all of this! Walk a little further, cross a little stream, and BOOM! The lake just catches you by surprise! We were lucky enough to find ducks and their ducklings in their home. Of course these pictures don’t do any justice Ryan actually seeing this live. It’s a pretty easy hike if you go slow. It’s just the first part of the trail is pretty killer. There are people who camp at this area with their families so don’t expect peace and quiet at the lake.",

We did have some trouble finding the trailhead as the directions I received were slightly different on my phone than my friend's phone. We decided to park near a couple other cars parked off to the side of the road and after walking down the road a bit, we found a rock trail marker about 20 feet up from the trail. We found this trailhead to be about 200 meters from AJ Motion Sports and its partner shops. Once on the trail we were grateful to have plenty of shade to block out the blazing 2 p.m. sun. We only saw one family coming down the trail when we were heading up and besides that we were the only ones there. There were many trails that forked off from each other but I think they all lead you to the lake. I would only suggest to always take the trail that leads up!",

156,2018-07-09,['hiking'],This easy to follow trail is good for the kids and a quick get away when time doesn’t allow for something longer.  The flowers are in full bloom and the trees offer plenty of shade no matter what time of day you go.  Be sure to carry plenty of bug spray as the flies are no respecter of sweaty flesh.,
157,2018-07-06,[''],Nice hike...initial portion of trail requires some vertical climbing but levels out near the lake. Trust the app/GPS on some of the parts that are not well marked.,

We did not see any wildlife but it might have been the wrong time of day for them (late afternoon). We came down a different way than we went up to get the full experience, but we ended up going to the wrong trailhead and had to walk back up the canyon road to get to our car, so that sucked. Apparently we missed the last creek crossing, which you'd think would have been obviously, but oh well. Still a beautiful hike.",
160,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"This is a new favorite! Has everything you’d want on a short easy hike: lush underbrush, tons of wildflowers (at their peak right now), aspens, shaded, ends at a beautiful lake.

162,2018-06-30,['walking'],Perfect hike with kids. We ran into a few moose along the way and some were a little too close for comfort but beautiful nonetheless. This was our first time and I think we would have missed the trail at the end had someone not warned us on our way down. Great to be in these amazing mountains!,
163,2018-06-30,['hiking'],"I was there 28 June, and saw 7 moose (6 in the lake area, and one on the trail)- see under photos.  The wild flowers on the north side are to be seen right now.  For those getting lost, there are three ways to the lake.  If you start at the labeled trailhead, then just past the sign and barely into the trail, there is a fork.  (1) If you take the left fork, it will tie into the old trail that goes through the residential area. It will come into the area below the lake from the west side. (2) If you take the right fork, it is steeper and will come into the area below the lake from the south.  (3) The third way is to go up Moose Track Lane (right at the rental recreation store), go up about 200 yards (heading west) and then do a 180 degree turn to back east. Just follow it to the end of the pavement is where the trail starts.  A little ways up that trail, method 1 above will tie into this trail.  If you take method 1 up, and want to take it down (rather than method 2)  then  on your way up carefully note where it ties into 3, as it is not marked, and easy to miss going down. As I recall, it will be right after a leaning tree as you go down. If you miss it and find yourself on the paved road in the residential area, you can just continue a couple hundreds yards down it, then do the U turn that will go back east and take you to Big Cottonwood Road. You will have a short walk back up to your car.",
164,2018-06-28,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful trail! The wildflowers were in full bloom, and we even saw a pair of moose by the lake. The first 0.25 mile is steeper than I anticipated, but it leveled out to a gentle incline. Kid friendly. I’d love to camp up by the lake. There were a couple fire pits already built.",
165,2018-06-26,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! Went around 8pm and the sunset through the trees is breathtaking. I loved how shaded the trail was and seeing the wildflowers bloom. We did see a mama and a baby moose, as well as a deer. Really neat, but be careful.",
166,2018-06-25,['hiking'],"This is a little gem of a hike, short and lush with lots of wildflowers. We also ran into a moose peacefully grazing by the lake. However, on our way back we took the West site of the loop and yes, like quite a few others, we ended up at some one’s cabin asking for directions. That’s the reason I am not giving five stars, because there is no indication as how to come down back to the trailhead. Instead, if you follow the most obvious, traveled path, by the time you reach the canyon’s road, you will have to walk back to the trailhead. Yet, in my opinion, the hike’s charm easily overrides the lack of directions in the way back.",

The first mile is steep and rocky, then it levels out a bit before opening into a huge, gorgeous meadow just prior to the lake. I missed the turn off coming back down and ended up in the cabins. I had to walk back up BCC road to get to the trail head. The turnoff is not marked and it's very small so look for it! There were a few deer and a skunk.

We went back on a different trail than we started on, as I heard it was less steep.  You do end up crossing some logs over a small stream, and it drops you down into a cabin area, taking that route we did need to walk back up the main road a bit to get back to our car. It was a great night!",

Still don’t know what was making the noise so often, but we now think it was rabbits or some other animal. Anyways prepare for is because you’ll hear it all night long.",

Snow was hard enough to walk on in some places, but if you don't have snowshoes plan on wearing water resistant boots for post-holing, with good grip for the icy sections.  Taking the right hand path upwards, the first half mile or so is pretty steep for out of shape students with backpacking stuff.  View across mountains just before lake was gorgeous.",

If you don't have snowshoes, you'll do a few snow lunges, particularly near the lake. Snowshoes will get in the way at the start, but would help the lake area be more enjoyable.",
189,2018-04-01,['hiking'],Went up it two days ago. Great views for such a short hike. Probably around 3 feet of snow but at the time that we went it was really solid so we we’re able to hike on the top of it though occasionally we would fall through a bit but we had good boots so it wasn’t too bad. Definitely would come back despite the snow.,

It was our first moderate hike, and it was really only bad because it was pretty icy, which made it a little more difficult than we expected, but once we got to the lake, it was amazing.  3 feet of snow that we were able to enjoy, ate a nice sandwich and watched the sun go down. was an awesome hike. definitely recommend.",

For those that don't like the steep part or have bad knees (especially going down), take the west trail. Go up Moose Track Lane by the rental store, right before the ""regular"" trail head. It will head west a short distance, and then do a 180 back east. The trail head is at the end of the pavement. A little longer than the ""regular"" way, but much easier.",

There is something so beautiful about leafless aspens against a light dusting of snow on the surrounding peaks.  We had the trail to ourselves but saw quite a few moose prints.  The lake was half frozen, and it was hilarious seeing the kids throw rock after rock trying in vain to break the ice.  We want to try this one every season of the year.  It's just that pretty.",

Some people were lounging in hammocks up near the water.  Great idea!  Many friendly faces along the trail.  There was a bit of snow along the shady sections of the hillsides.  We made a snowman!  Trail is easy to follow.  There is a section near the start of the trail that forks off and isn't marked.  Luckily other hikers told us to go right up towards the steep section rather than go left.",

It is NOT a beginner trail, and folks who said little kids hiked it easily must be a family of hikers. It is steep, but not dangerous-climb up rocks steep. Once to the prairie and the lake it's pretty, but not that special when compared to magnificent vistas we see everywhere. We saw moose tracks along the way, and a moose with big antlers sunning by the lake (included in pics). For us, seeing the moose was worth it! We went at 10am on a weekday.",

209,2017-09-05,['hiking'],"I feel like I have kind of become a trail snob because I have gone on so many hikes this year that I am more picky than I normally would be, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. This trail is very steep. Pretty much straight up the hill side. You gain most of the elevation in the first 1/2 mile and it's also really rocky in places. That being said, since the steepness is a short distance it's not that bad. I saw a family with really little ones and they made it to the top. Although I wouldn't recommend taking really little ones as they could trip over the rocks and hurt themselves. I also think coming down is a bit dangerous in spots. I personally had to take fairly small steps and almost slid at one point because of the loose rocks and steep decent. The trail should have been made as switchbacks up the hill so that it was safer. The lake was nice and I bet the wildflowers would have been amazing a few weeks ago. When I got up there (labor day morning at about 9am) there were quite a few people...including yelling and screaming children, so I would recommend going early if you want to avoid the loud family crowds. I did the whole loop around the lake, which gets fairly overgrown. It was about 2.1 miles with that loop. Took me just over an hour.",

Skeeters are present but not in Alaska proportions- wear deet anyway. Always a fun place. Only wish is that Utah Open Lands would sponsor some volunteer trail builders to put in some switchbacks going up the hill, it's a tough one for little kids. A gem so close to town.",

1. The aspens are beautiful and I'm sure they'll look even better in the fall.
2. Flowers were in full bloom. Seriously, so many varities!!
3. Surprisingly remote! May be in part becuase it was mid week, but we saw only a half dozen or so people the whole trip.
4. We saw a moose! Two actually. They came out to the clearing right by our camp in the evening and stayed there most of the night. Needless to say we kept our distance.",

250,2016-09-16,['hiking'],Beautiful quick easy hike in and out in an hour.  I didn't have an issue with flies although many have reported that they do.  Hike is steep but short.  Ducks up at the pond will eat out of your hand.  Be sure to follow the trail all the way around the lake for a great chance to see moose.

There are not any signs.There is a fork toward the end and you go to the left to get to the lake. 

Maybe bring some food for the ducks because they will walk up to you and even eat out of your hands, if you don't mind the risk of a bite. The aspen tree's were beautiful and there were some nice flowers, but the fields were not full of them.  We got up there around 8 or 8:30 and it was great weather and great view with the sun on the lake. It's kind of steep in that the 600 plus feet is done in just one mile, but definitely manageable and well worth the short hike. The meadow is beautiful and to is the lake.",

Once off the ridge we spent quite a bit of time checking out this area and then took the normal trail out.

NOTE the track shows is not the trail, that track is from the road through cabins, most hikers stop 1/4 mile east of Silver Fork lodge, there's a large rock with trail name etched in it. Look at the satellite layer of this map and ""Willow Lake Trail"" is clearly marked. If you took the trail from the private cabin it probably would not be so steep, perhaps that explains the discrepancy.

And the wild flowers are beginning to bloom too! The Lake at the top is so calm and peaceful and perfect. Seriously, it looks unreal. I saw only three other people on the hike (major win). 

Most of the elevation gain is right at the beginning. It seems ""moderately"" strenuous. After the first half mile or so it levels out and is an easy stroll to the lake. There isn't much coverage, so wear sunscreen if you burn easy. 

Lastly, I saw a baby moose up off of the east loop. I didn't see the mama but I assume she was close. Keep your eyes peeled and be safe, the mamas can be protective/aggressive this time of year.",

I took my 5 and 7 year old, they did amazingly. The temp. once we got up there was probably only 50-55 degrees, but it felt ok as long as you were hiking. We were the only ones on the trail as it was a little overcast. The colors were absolutely breathtaking!! We paused so many times on the way up to gaze at all the fall colors. Once we got to the lake the views only got more beautiful and we were able to feed some very friendly ducks and see 2 moose! This one is definitely going on our re-do list. :)

DIRECTIONS: Barbara Munoz's directions on her review were perfect and took us right to the trailhead. Just make sure that you park on the main road and walk up Moose Track Road.

Do not let the beginning climb detour you, it is steep but then levels out to an aspen grove, then on to a lovely open meadow that precedes the lake. Moose like this area. We saw four moose ( 3 bulls and a female) munching at the lake. We continued to hike from the lake to dry lake; about another 1/2 mile. That trail is steep but not rocky and I would rate it at moderate. The trail is a little overgrown toward the overlook. The overlook of Willow Heights lake and into Big Cottonwood is worth the trek up. Dry lake is another pretty meadow.

285,2015-06-19,[''],"First, FYI, there are two trails that converge just before the lake. While the elevation gain is about the same on both trails, one is more gradual and would be better for small children. The more gradual one starts in the cabins just to the west of the small set of stores on the north side of the road just up the road from Silver Fork Lodge. You walk up Moose Track Road and take a hard right when the road comes to an intersection. That road will soon dead end and that is where the more gradual trail starts. There is no trail head sign, just a sign that says ""Conservation Area, Stay on Trail."" The other Willow Heights trail head that is actually marked (although still not very visible from the road) is just a bit further up the main road and that trail is considerably steeper and more rocky. When my friend and I hiked it today, we took the more gradual up and the steeper trail down. We were thankful to have trekking poles to steady us. All that said, it really is a lovely hike. The ""lake"" is more of a pond, but the entire hike you have mostly shade, groves of aspens, and wildflowers.",
286,2015-06-09,[''],Beautiful views !!!,
287,2015-05-31,[''],"Beautiful area. My first hike of the season. I had been stock for two weeks, so the steepness killed me. But it was worth the agony. We'll do this one a couple more times this year.",
288,2015-05-31,['hiking'],"Nice, relatively easy hike. Hardest part is finding the trailhead from the road. My hiking guidebook lists the distance as 2 miles and about 1 hour. We did it in about an hour, including a few stops for pictures. Lots of beautiful scenery. Would be a nice place to pack a picnic. We even saw a deer!",
289,2015-05-25,['hiking'],Pretty simple trail easily accessible.,
290,2015-05-01,['hiking'],"We did this little hike in early March when the snow was still fairly deep. It was gorgeous and we have a great view of the slopes from there. The lake was completely covered in snow so we had a harder time finding it but the view was not bad. We are curious to see it in the summer now too. This is a perfect hike for young children or those who are looking for a quick but effective workout. We saw a few back country skiers, boarders and people snow-shoeing.",
291,2015-02-15,['hiking'],This isn't the prettiest lake in the summer. It's best seen in fall and winter. Took a snowy hike up to the lake on February 14th and it was gorgeous! The lake was completely cover over in snow. You'd think it was just another snow-covered meadow if you didn't know it was there. So pretty and peaceful. I'll be saving this hike for winter from now on.,
292,2014-10-02,['hiking'],It was a beautiful time to visit this lake as it was frosted with snow on the top of the mountains and the leaves were still changing colors. Absolutely beautiful.,
293,2014-09-01,['hiking'],Easy short hike to a small lake. Most of the elevation change (~500ft) is within the first quarter mile. The best part of the hike is the groves of Quaking Aspen trees - likely golden in the fall.  Saw ducks and moose on the hike.,
294,2014-08-18,[''],"The lake was pretty until you got close, then it was ugly. Stay on the trail, I didn't and my legs are covered with hives",
295,2014-08-17,[''],"I probably wouldn't do this trail again. The steep incline was a nice workout and there was some shade and lots of pretty Aspen. But once you reach the end of the trail, the view just wasn't that great. Not a very pretty lake, which I didn't even know was a thing.",
296,2014-06-06,['hiking'],"This hike is georgeous. Slightly steep in a few spots where I slid a bit, but overall not hard at all, lots of beauty and wildlife if there aren't too many people and not too loud. Saw two deer. Just a very lovely hike not too long. Great evening hike.",
297,2014-05-28,['hiking'],"Great little hike with fabulous views once you reach the lake. 
Completed with my 7 & 9 year old children and they loved it as well. It was a bit steep at the outset, but easy going thereafter.",
298,2013-09-22,['hiking'],Loved this hike! It's short but uphill pretty much the whole way to the lake. If you're at all out of shape like me it'll be a decent work out... however the steep climb through the aspen forest takes you to a lovely meadow view and quiet lake! I went on a sunny fall Saturday afternoon and still only passed a few other groups and had the lake to myself. I recommend also going in fall when the aspens are changing colors. ,
299,2013-08-19,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! Just make sure to bring bug spray. ,
300,2013-07-30,['hiking'],This trail is gorgeous. I love the aspens and there are almost always moose by the lake. ,
301,2012-09-21,['hiking'],There are resident moose that are often seen on this trail. The pin marking the trailhead on Googlemaps is on the wrong side of Big Cottonwood rd. ,
302,2010-05-16,['hiking'],Easy hike through aspens and meadows. The pond is a peaceful place to sit and relax. ,
