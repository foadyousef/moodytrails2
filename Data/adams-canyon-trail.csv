1,2019-09-06,['hiking'],Hiked this today with our 4 and 6 year old. A couple tricky spots but overall not to bad with the kids and the waterfall was so worth it 
2,2019-09-04,"['trail running', 'closed']",Currently closed because of the Snoqualmie fire.
3,2019-09-03,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'scramble']","I did this trail on August 15th, 2019. It was described to be much more difficult than it actually was for me. I hit the trail at 0730 with a temperature of 59 degree F. I made my way up the few switchbacks, which are entirely exposed. Leaving early, I was never in direct sunlight for the ascent. Once you get to the top of the switchbacks, veer to the right to get to the falls. As I entered the brush into the canyon it was cool. Although every stop for photo ops meant getting attacked by mosquitoes, so do bring bug spray. A creek runs adjacent to the trail the whole way, so bringing a dog would be ok. As you get closer to the falls, a bit of scrambling is necessary, but not very difficult. Good boots are helpful, but I honestly could have done this trail in Chaco’s. I got to the falls right at 0830, took a few photos and cooled off. Once I got out of the canyon, the sun was up and direct. I was glad I brought water. Returned to my vehicle at 0930 with a temperature of 72 degrees F. Overall, this is a great and convenient hike. The falls are worth the work and a great place to cool off, although they are surrounded by rock walls, so go early when not many people are there yet. Had the falls to myself."
4,2019-09-02,['hiking'],The Sandy switch backs kinda kicks your butt in the beginning and right before the waterfall you are hugging the rocks and that’s a little bit sketchy for a newbie. It’s all about foot placement. If I can do it anyone can do it! 
5,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Was a good trail!  Took our dog and made it up and back in about 2 and a half hours.  There’s some spots with some bees over the water that are a little intimidating but made it by them without a problem :).  I would recommend coming around 5 to make it down by 8 at latest for the best weather.  We came at 12 and it was hot for the first part of the trail but there was acid shade throughout the rest.  Our dog loved it :)

7,2019-08-29,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Little hard for beginners but nice hike for a nature lovers 
8,2019-08-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']",The trail is not well marked and difficult to follow in some places.. especially at the top. The trail also becomes fairly technical and rocky. I wouldn’t recommend hiking it by yourself.. too many risks for injury with the rocks and in veering off trail. 
9,2019-08-27,['hiking'],I’ve hiked this more times than I can count and it never gets easier. Shout out to the dude who cut his leg up on the way up

12,2019-08-21,['hiking'],This is a great hike although very populated. I would suggest going very early on a weekday. 
13,2019-08-20,['hiking'],"Great trail!  It was way too hot when we started, so I would say start about 5:30 pm giving yourself plenty of time to come back down during daylight."
14,2019-08-20,['hiking'],"Nice trail, steep from the start. Or at least I thought it was, but I am a novice hiker. Wasn’t able to finish because there was a swarm in wasp along the path that I didn’t feel comfortable passing. Overall nice waterfall and hike."
15,2019-08-18,['hiking'],What an amazing hike.
16,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"love this trail. I lost my keys though, so if anyone finds a key ring on a purple carabiner, please contact me at 310-867-0808. thanks!"
17,2019-08-15,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
18,2019-08-13,['hiking'],"this trail was a beautiful, short hike. the first part up the hill on the initial trailhead is quite the leg workout, but once you get up there is an easy hike with great views all around. I highly recommend making it a sunset hike if you can :)"
19,2019-08-13,['hiking'],"My first hike with this app! The hike was not nearly as easy as I thought it would be, but I enjoyed it. There was climbing of rocks and even a little bit of getting your feet wet in order to get to the final waterfall. It was nice though. Only complaint is that I wish it was marked better... I was by myself and kept getting “lost” (nothing serious... but I veered off the path a few times). "
20,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
21,2019-08-10,['hiking'],This is a great little trail! The first .5 miles are dusty switchbacks but after that it’s a shaded hike in the trees next to a cooling stream. The bridge over the stream is at 1.5 and then it’s a good climb to the to waterfall at 1.9 miles. I prefer to do this hike in the evening where you can watch an amazing sunset on your way down. Great hike!
22,2019-08-06,"['hiking', 'no shade']",Love doing this hike with my dog. The beginning is definitely the hardest part because of switch backs worth minimal shade. Once that part is over the rest is fun and basically all shaded. There is one more part that is rocky at the end to reach the waterfall but overall gorgeous trail.
23,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"The waterfall at the end is the BEST. I hiked this trail in 100 degree weather. TAKE WATER. The switchbacks during the first part of the trail are not shaded at all. But... think this is my favorite trail so far. It’s not easy at all, but well worth it."
24,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']","The end result... beautiful!!! Switchbacks with no shade in the beginning... and moderate my ass lol this had us climbing rocks, using tree roots and luckily people could show us where the trail was because it is not easily marked.... but the end, BEAUTIFUL!!"
25,2019-08-05,['hiking'],Biked not hiked. Had a blast
26,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'rocky']","It is a beautiful hike. The waterfall at the end is definitely worth seeing! of note I would not classify this hike as just moderate. The first half of the hike is moderate, but the last half is at least moderate-hard."
27,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Dogs poop everywhere, bugs... not for beginners."
28,2019-07-29,['hiking'],Love the waterfall
29,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'rocky']",
30,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
31,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Pretty hike once you get past the switch backs and into the trees. It feels like the hard side of moderate. There is a lot of scrambling over rocks and the trail is washed out in some spots. This hike would be so much better if people picked up after their dog's! 
32,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Such a great hike..
33,2019-07-27,['hiking'],Definitely one of the best hikes in Utah. Lots of shade after about the first half mile. I did hike with 3 year old daughter and for the most part it wasn't to bad. it rained and made all the rocks super slippery and I had to carry my daughter the last part before the waterfall.  There is like 3 or 4 really steep parts that make it scary if it's wet. 
34,2019-07-24,['hiking'],"Crowded and lots of people with dogs. Climbed the first several switchbacks with my young kids. I hear further up would have been difficult for young kids. Beautiful view, just short on time. "
35,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'scramble']","I was a bit skeptical at first - went about 3pm (which I'd never do again). Not really for beginners! I loved how the river wound to keep you motivated to see the source! The trail would drift away and just when you think you somehow ended up on the wrong trail a gorgeous spot of water pops into the picture to give you a little boost! It is mostly uphill and not much flat relief - bring lots of water!! Go slow if needed!
Downfall - Really other than the heat which was an error on my part, the only downfall was the amount of wasps near the standing/slower moving water! I am actually shocked I didn't get stung! Otherwise keep going to the end it was well worth it!"
36,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Went about 7 am on Pioneer Day.  Not too busy when we got there.  Getting busy when we headed back down.  Shaded after you enter the canyon.  Beginning switchbacks and approach are exposed.  I liked the fact that there were some pretty steep parts followed by relatively flat grade sections that seemed to alternate occasionally.  Gave the legs a needed break a couple of times.  Waterfall is awesome. Different than most waterfalls in the area  in that it's kinda wide and doesn't just flow out of a narrow crevice like most around here.  Good change of pace.  There are a few sections where you choose between rock hopping in the creek or scrambling a steep bank.  Maybe I just didn't look around enough for other options?  Personally I prefer it to Waterfall Canyon in Ogden. I will definitely do it again. I think it was about 1 hour 30 minutes round trip with about 10 minutes spent at the waterfall.
37,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",Great trail but not easy for beginners or out of shape people. Switchbacks don't have shade and are Sandy and sometimes washed out. At the trailhead with two arrows go to the right to head toward the falls. Walking sticks would also come in handy as it gets steep. Coming down can sometimes be more difficult than going up but the reward was worth it. 
38,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",If you’re tip top shape hiker junkie this hike is moderate but if you’re an average joe just wanting to see a waterfall the hike is pretty hard. Lots of steep rocky parts that get you out of breathe but very shaded and lovely on a hot day. Waterfall is beautiful and a nice refreshment after the tiring hike. Also there and back is 5 miles so just be aware of that. But 10/10 would recommend. 
39,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Great hike. Try to go early, the switchbacks don’t have shade. Once in the canyon and under the bushes and trees it’s really nice.  Lots of wasps near the standing water along the trail.  Coming down the switchbacks the sand was too hot for my dogs feet. Ended up having to run down to get him in shade.  "
40,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"My sister and I hiked this trail this past Saturday. We started around 8:00 a.m., and completed it at approximately 10:30 a.m. The weather was absolutely perfect. We did encounter plenty of people and dogs on the trail, but everyone was very friendly. The scenery is utterly amazing from start-to-finish. Thankfully we did not encounter hordes of bugs or dog crap on the trail. Overall, a terrific experience. "
41,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade']",
42,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"The perfect moderate trail, just get through those first few switch backs and you’ll be in the nature you know and love. I did this in the afternoon, so after making it to the waterfall the mist and breeze were a nice treat Ü"
43,2019-07-13,['hiking'],Decent trail. Lots of traffic though. Lots of families with little kids and dogs. I usually have to add at least 30 minutes to my time because of all the traffic. Early in the morning (6am) or later evening is best. Encounter several snakes about two days ago so keep an eye and ear out for them. Also be careful with all the horse and dog poop. 
44,2019-07-12,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble']",first part is exposed switchbacks.  but then it's covered and follows river
45,2019-07-11,['hiking'],"Great trail, unfortunately there is dog crap all over the first part with the switchbacks and it stinks horribly.  
The upper and lower falls are both great, but people leave trash EVERYWHERE.  My wife and I always take a bag and pick up everyone else's trash because we live close and like to hike here!  Please always pack it out!  If you take children, watch them and pick up after them, this is here to be enjoyed by everyone."
46,2019-07-09,['hiking'],Beautiful hike.  We went on a Monday night and there was very little traffic.  
47,2019-07-08,['hiking'],"The switchbacks are dusty and can be hot in the afternoon. 

Bring water shoes during the runoff. This will  get you across the water at the end. 

Don't try to wear water shoes the whole way unless you can run through a Japanese game show with them. the sporadic bouldering and sidehilling on this hike is no joke at times.

My Daughter (17) did it with a  broken collar bone no splint fell and tweaked her into bawling only once.

Also as stated previous, bring a trash bag and pack out more than you bring. The ""entitled lot"" have been here in force."
48,2019-07-08,['hiking'],"The first portion is sandy trails which are more recently washed out.  I have passed many people going up and back who inquire if it lasts the whole way.  It doesn't.  Once past the steep sandy first portion the trail grows more and more enjoyable with icy water to play in further up, and shade.  Love this trail.  The trail has gotten more and more crowded on weekends, and recently there are vendors setting up and selling snowcones/food at the entrance so more commercial, but it is still really enjoyable.  "
49,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'washed out']","The waterfall was beautiful. BUT Seriously people, CLEAN up your dog sh*t. It was honestly disgusting this whole hike smelled nasty... Clean it up and take out or put a ban on the dogs in my opinion. "
50,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"Unbelievable in so many ways -

The trail is really cool after the initial sandy switchbacks. 

The falls are unbelievably beautiful.  

So is the amount of dog sh** on the trail and the hikers who can’t pick it up. 

And the people who blast their music on the trail.  Most of us get out and hike to get away from that.  

And the people who have their headphones in and can’t hear you when asking permission to pass.  

And all the garbage at the falls - the apples tucked in the bushes, the gummy bears all over the trail, the crackers and the sandwich bags - WTH????  How hard is it to pick up after yourself?

Mother Nature would be ashamed of y’all. 

Glad I did it but won’t be back.  Good luck to the rest of you who choose to hike here.  If it’s serenity and escape from the daily grind, look elsewhere. 

"
51,2019-07-04,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Nice trail with a little scrambling. Great falls. 
52,2019-07-04,['hiking'],A lot of traffic. Go early or late evening to avoid the traffic.
53,2019-07-03,['hiking'],We loved this trail!! It was beautiful and very fun to hike!
54,2019-07-03,['hiking'],Did this hike Sunday with friends and two 6 year old boys. The boys did great and loved the rock climbing. Some steeper areas and had to walk through the river at the top as the water level is high. Waterfall at the end is totally worth it. Was crowded at the top but to be expected on a nice Sunday afternoon. Took us nearly 3 hours total. 
55,2019-06-30,['hiking'],Awesome for kids. A couple of steep areas
56,2019-06-30,['hiking'],Definitely a favorite.
57,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'washed out']",
58,2019-06-30,[''],"Shady and gorgeous views, love the stream that runs along the trail"
59,2019-06-29,['hiking'],Pretty stern test.  If you have real small children or are not in pretty good physical condition I would not recommend.  Some dicey spots that require your undivided attention.  I would take a minimum of 32 oz of water.  
60,2019-06-29,['hiking'],Great trail... had some difficult parts but the waterfall at the end made it worth it...
61,2019-06-27,['hiking'],Did a family day trip up with 5 kids (9-15) and made it to the falls.  Nice easy hike with beautiful view at the falls. The bottom has really been groomed up from years back.
62,2019-06-26,"['hiking', 'rocky']",super fun trail
63,2019-06-25,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'no shade', 'scramble', 'washed out']",This was my very first hike in Utah so I was still acclimating to the elevation and getting in shape. The first part of the trail was brutal because it consists of very steep switchbacks and no shade. It gets much better once you reach the shaded forest. I took off one star for the dangerous scrambling over the eroded steep bank towards the end to get to the falls because the water was raging and you can't climb up the river bed (you could probably do so during a dry year). I honestly did not feel safe doing it and my partner had to talk me through a couple scary spots. Be prepared to get your feet wet since you need to do the river crossing to actually see the falls. 
64,2019-06-25,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'washed out']","Beautiful hike, went at 5:30pm, took our time then hiked back out watching the sun set over Salt Lake. Stunning all around. However if you’re planning to get to the top, this should be considered a “hard” hike currently with how washed out it is. In a couple areas you have to go through the water and in a couple cases you have to climb over an eroded steep bank. Once at the top you have to cross a powerful current of at least a foot deep to get to the other side to see the waterfall. This trail made me realize how worn the tread is on my boots and how they are no longer waterproof!"
65,2019-06-24,['hiking'],Adventurous hike!  The trail starts out on soft sandy ground as you do several switchbacks with a continual incline to the top.  The trail is really rocky with some fun gnarly  sections.  Unfortunately the falls can't be seen right now unless you're prepared to cross the river.  If we had  known we would have brought water shoes.  There are still other awesome things to see along the way though!
66,2019-06-24,['hiking'],"This trail was awesome!! It was about 4.25 miles and was washed out in multiple spots, so the terrain was rather rocky! I took my dog along with me, and he loved it! At the mouth of the waterfall, there are strong currents. If you bring small children, or dogs, make sure you’re able to carry them through said currents where you can view the falls (many people were seen doing this, as well as myself), so bring water shoes!!! "
67,2019-06-23,['hiking'],"Great trail! Mostly shady with a large stream for a majority of the hike. Beautiful waterfall at the end. Very crowded though, but worth it. Will definitely go again."
68,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'washed out']","A gorgeous hike, but not currently safe for toddlers and little kids. the trail is so washed out in places that you have to go through the water or scramble over eroded banks--not something you want to do with a three year old. And it's too popular."
69,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'washed out']",Very crowded. Lots of kids and dogs. Too much scrambling for young kids. Can’t see the falls without getting wet. 
70,2019-06-19,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Always an enjoyable hike. Above the bridge crossing the hill side has washed out in couple of places and eliminated the trail. Still accessible with scrambling across rocks. 
71,2019-06-18,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'washed out']",The beginning and ending of the trail are the steepest. there are several washed out spots which require travelling the stream. 
72,2019-06-18,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes. Unfortunately, it has become extremely popular and weekends and holidays are a joke.  "
73,2019-06-17,['hiking'],"I absolutely love this trail. Been on it a few times. The waterfall at the end is gorgeous! But ..... when we hiked this a few days ago, we did encounter an angry rattlesnake. So that wasnt very fun (actually pretty freaky). But still a great hike."
74,2019-06-17,['hiking'],The hike was good! I wouldn’t say it’s moderate. Especially how the trail is washed out. There is quite a lot of dog poop in the beginning during the steep switchbacks. But other than that. The hike has such beautiful views! You do have to cross the freezing cold water in order to see the waterfall!
75,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","Lots of traffic, especially on weekends and holidays.  Some of it is in the sun, so start early. I’m a little surprised this is ‘moderate’. This is pretty steep with some scrambles and rocky climbs; and you cross a wide, rocky stream at the top to view the waterfall. late fall through early spring you should have yaktrax or spikes because it gets icy. The waterfall is pretty nice! Also, as of early June 2019 the stream is running high and fast and there are Point where it is very difficult to avoid walking in the water."
76,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'scramble']",The trail is washed out some but that made if fun for us! I would recommend bringing water shoes or a change of shoes or walk to the falls themselves barefoot. 
77,2019-06-15,['hiking'],After the switchbacks everything is just beautiful. Great hike for a beginning hiker who wants a challenge.
78,2019-06-15,"['hiking', 'washed out']",
79,2019-06-14,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","May 27, 2019.  Snow still on trail the last 1/4 of the trail to the waterfall but worth it. "
80,2019-06-14,['hiking'],"fun, good workout. didnt make it all the way to the waterfall. little ones got tired. dog owners, please clean after your dogs. there is a lot of dog poop along the trail. we saw a baby rattlesnake. "
81,2019-06-14,[''],"only bad part is crossing the freezing river at the end but the view was worth it
"
82,2019-06-12,['hiking'],"Overall a good trail, but it is heavily trafficked. Went on a weekday night and the trail was especially crowded on the way down. There are some sketchy areas with slick rock and also near the top where, if you're not in the water, you're holding onto the side of the mountain. Bring water shoes if you don't want to soak your shoes to see the actual falls. "
83,2019-06-11,[''],"Great trail, just like everyone has said it's very popular so some parts of the trail can get backed up and a bottleneck happens. We hiked this trail last year in May and it was definitely washed out in places this year. (typically where the bottlenecks where happening.) I'd say it's pretty safe for kids but definitely due to the washed out areas might not be appropriate for younger kids. There is a lot more water running down and over the trail than last year. The falls though is about the same from last year. Overall I'd say that this is a moderate to hard trail depending on fitness level. It's pretty shaded too once you get back into the canyon and passed the switch backs. "
84,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'washed out']","beautiful trail, some parts are washed out this year. very heavily trafficked, with people causing bottlenecks where the trail is washed out. our 6 year old did okay, it was too much for the 3 year old. I did love the part through the woods next to the creek."
85,2019-06-06,['hiking'],I think it’s actually closer to 5 miles round trip.  The water was too fast to get to the final waterfall.  Still a fun and hard trail!
86,2019-06-06,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
87,2019-06-06,[''],"Fun trail! 
"
88,2019-06-05,['hiking'],"I’ve hiked this several times but today there was no way to hike it without getting wet. The trail is washed out in several places with the creek running right over where the regular trail is. This makes for more rock scrambling than usually. And to see the waterfall at the top, I waded through icy cold water up to my knees. (Usually you can just walk across rocks without getting wet.)  Just be prepared if you hike it in a high water spring. I wished I had brought poles to steady myself on the wet rocks too. On a side note, I love this hike in the winter when the waterfall is frozen. Just be sure to wear spikes. "
89,2019-06-04,['hiking'],This trail is a favorite of mine only for the fact that it is close. The switch backs are rough but once you get through that part it is absolutely beautiful. 
90,2019-06-04,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'washed out']","beautiful trail the entire way. i just hiked to the falls today and there were quite a few spots where the trail was washed out. the falls itself right now is crazy, not like pictured here. there's a lot of water flowing right now. the bridge was partially under water on the way back but still passable. "
91,2019-06-03,[''],"Fun hike. Beautiful trail!  Very crowded though!  Due to some creek crossings - one was pretty deep in swift water, as well at the sloping and slick terrain, it's probably not the best hike for small children. "
92,2019-06-03,[''],"Beautiful hike. Because I'm a novice it took me two hours to get to the big waterfall and 1.5 hrs back down but well worth it. You will get wet since you have to go in the river a couple of times and at the top you have to completely cross the river to get to see the waterfall. Temperature just right with lots of shade. There are a lot of rocky hills, slippery in some spots.  At the Y in the path before you get to trees keep to the left to continue to the big waterfall. 
"
93,2019-06-02,['hiking'],We only went to the lower falls. We had it all to ourselves for 20 minutes. Kids loved walking through the cold water. It’s and easy 1 mile each way to the lower fall
94,2019-06-02,['rocky'],"was way fun, took us about 2 1/2 hours, prepare to get wet feet"
95,2019-06-01,['hiking'],As beautiful as ever! With it being such a wet spring the river is really high right now making the current pretty strong and you do have to cross it at the very end of the hike to see the waterfall so that’s something to remember before you start out. I wouldn’t have younger children cross this time of year. Such a fun hike!
96,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"I really enjoyed this hike, there are a lot of flat spots between the incline so it’s definitely not steep all the way up. Make sure to check out the lower Falls too. "
97,2019-05-31,['hiking'],"Water is high in spring, but still manageable if you don't mind getting wet.  "
98,2019-05-30,['hiking'],Lot of water at the top today.
99,2019-05-28,"['bugs', 'muddy', 'washed out']","Great trail, beautiful waterfalls. The water is high and some dogs and small children were having a difficult time crossing the river. Be careful. "
100,2019-05-26,['hiking'],Little bit washed out in places so get ready to get your feet wet but other then that I️t was great and the waterfalls were raging
101,2019-05-21,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Couldn’t see the waterfall at first because the water level was so high. If you are feeling adventurous, you can climb the rocks without getting your feet too wet and get a great view. Loved the varying terrain! "
102,2019-05-20,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'washed out']",It is a nice trail for about 3/4ths of the way. You will get to a point where you have to climb or go up and around. I highly reccomend going later in the season if you want to see the waterfall.
103,2019-05-17,[''],Hard to do with children but doable. I just want to encourage people to go all the way and not just to the lower falls because I've encountered so many people who gave up at the lower falls yet they're maybe a couple minutes at most away from the grand spout. 
104,2019-05-15,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'washed out']",super busy. people. dogs. bikes. horses. full parking almost all the time. very easy hike. 
105,2019-05-14,['hiking'],Very dynamic hike. Lots of rocks and intertwining with a stream. Super fun took my dogs. At points need to use hands and it feels like bouldering!
106,2019-05-13,['hiking'],"What a great hike. A lot of people but everyone was very friendly. Warning, if you don’t want wet feet don’t do this hike. The water felt great after a quick hike up. There are some tricky spots along the way and I highly recommend hiking shoes for the grip alone. A lot of dogs and families along the way and everyone seems to make it no problem to the top. "
107,2019-05-12,['hiking'],"This is our second time hiking this trail, first time though was in July of last year so it was much different. This fine area there were some harder areas and areas where you had no choice but to trek through the water. My 5 year old and two dogs were able to make it to the falls though. Still a great hike"

111,2019-05-09,['hiking'],"Awesome cascading water falls and large 25' tall falls at very top of trail. Moderate inclines with switchbacks first 1/2 mile until entering forest canopy. Follows creek the entire route. Moderately difficult through last 1/4 mile, especially with high water. Beautiful trail. Worth the effort. Heavily used. Passed 25-30 people on a Thursday early afternoon."
112,2019-05-04,['hiking'],Very beautiful hike. I’d say it’s moderate- moderate/hard. People went all the way to the waterfall but we didn’t because there way a slushy snow spot that looked a little slippery.. we were carrying our one year old so we just turned back. The whole hike follows a beautiful river! It’s an incline almost the whole way. Watch your footing on some parts!
113,2019-05-03,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","I’ve hiked this trail many times. It’s a great hike close to town. The trail is easy to follow and surprisingly dry most of the way. There is a little snow slide about 3/4 of the way up that you will have to navigate. It can be a little sketchy as it is slippery. Other than that, you can make it almost all the way to the waterfall with dry shoes. The last 50 feet you will probably get wet. There was a few older couples that made it up today. I don’t know how they navigated that slippery section, but I would say give it a few more weeks before you bring kids under 10."
114,2019-05-03,['hiking'],Pretty much incline from the time you step on the trail. Steep and rocky in some spots. Nice to get into the trees and close to the creek. I wouldn’t recommend for small children. I’d do this one again!
115,2019-05-01,[''],"I hiked it and it was incredible, however I saw several mountain bikers.  I have hiked this trail a dozen times and never seen a biker.  There were lots of pups on the trail.  The water was rushing water from the snow melt.  Amazing but scary in a few spots."
116,2019-04-29,['hiking'],"Adams canyon trail report:
Trail is dry at lower elevations trail washes out in a few places with large amounts of runoff water! A few difficult sections of snow and wet muddy trails at upper elevations. Use extreme caution and be responsible if your taking family and friends."
117,2019-04-27,['hiking'],This trail has great views and is really well kept.  I saw a lot of mountain bikers riding this trail as well.
118,2019-04-27,['hiking'],"I’m new to the area and found the trail by complete accident so I wasn’t prepared for such a hike. The trail starts out very well groomed but it eventually becomes more rugged and slippery. That said, this was a fantastic little hike. Absolutely gorgeous views."
119,2019-04-24,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Small patch of slippery snow/ice near the top, but path is otherwise clear.

Recommend wearing Chacos/Tevas or some other water shoes as the river level is high enough to require walking in the water in several spots."
120,2019-04-20,"['hiking', 'snow']",Awesome trail! Overall very easily maneuverable. Lots of snow up near the top of the trail along with the need to walk through the water to see the top of the falls. My suggestion: wear some merrels or chacos and be ready for some cold feet!! Totally worth it though. Our dogs LOVED it!! ❤️
121,2019-04-20,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']",Fun trail lots of shade gorgeous scenery went with seven kids and for adults was a fairly moderate trail some of the water was on the trail but still able to get around just fine
122,2019-04-20,[''],Nice moderate level trail. took 1.5 hours up and 45 minutes down. Still snow packed in the middle half- I had microspiked which I recommend. Other people were doing it without but pretty risky. You have to walk through the creek in parts and to see the final water fall.
123,2019-04-08,[''],very awsome! icy at the top.

128,2019-03-17,[''],"The hike up is a series of switchbacks and steep enough that these Florida hikers were out of breath pretty quickly. how about we took our time and enjoy the view. There is a lot of traffic noise as you go up.

at the top there is a marker but it mentions nothing about Adams Falls. we went to the right and it appears we made the right choice. went down into a canyon and it became peaceful and quiet with the sound of rushing water.

There was still quite a bit of ice and so we were unable to make it to the waterfall. we stopped at the bridge and enjoyed the water and then hiked back.

At the marker we tried the other side and that basically took us along a ridge that overlooks the city. We didn't take that very far before we turned back.

Overall it was a nice outing and would be a good place to try again when the ice melts."
129,2019-03-17,['hiking'],There was quite a bit of snow on the ground when I did this hike and it was snowing as we went. The snow made the hike even more beautiful! The trail was already packed down from hikers before us! There were some steep parts which the snow made challenging but the waterfall at the top was totally worth it! By far my favorite hike in the area so far!
130,2019-03-16,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",I would like to rate this somewhere between easy to moderate.I recommend to bring poles or crampons as there are many icy spots as we go up in the mountains. I saw many people sliding down. Overall it was great experience for me and would like to do this again in spring or summer.
131,2019-03-04,['hiking'],A beautiful canyon. Highly recommend this hike. I would rate this hike closer to hard. Maybe I was just having a hard day but it is pretty steep.
132,2019-02-16,"['hiking', 'snow']",One of my favorite trails when I visit Hill AFB. Mainly because it's an excellent after work hike in the Sping. Today was great with 3 inches of fresh snow (trail was already packed down from other hikers by noon) and icicles on the waterfall. Crampons a must.
133,2019-02-15,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite hiking destinations.. the view is absolutely amazing. Great family adventure!!
134,2019-02-15,"['hiking', 'snow']",Took about 2 hours. Microspikes are a must right now! Some of it is even a bit slippery/difficult with spikes on. Keep an eye out of the way up for other frozen waterfalls.
135,2019-01-27,[''],"Great hike today. MicroSpikes absolutely necessary,  snowshoes not needed. Trail was packed down nicely.  Took 1 hr to reach waterfall which was running pretty well. Overall great hike today, not too many people."
136,2019-01-19,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'snow']","Great day hike trail in the winter. Lots of cute pups along the way and a great payoff at the end. A bit slippery coming back - Would rec bringing spikes, yak trax, poles or snow shoes if you have them. Still doable if you don’t!"
137,2019-01-15,[''],Nothing short of amazing. I have done this hike four times this year but the winter brings a whole new beauty to this hike. Waterfall is mostly frozen. Beautiful take your camera.
138,2019-01-09,[''],One of my favorite trails I’ve ever hiked!! Love the river that’s right next to you and the scenery is amazing!! Definitely a must do!!
139,2018-12-01,['hiking'],Beautiful hike at the end of November (11/30/18). Heavy snow kept us from attempting the last quarter mile but I was playing it safe with my girlfriend. It's doable but slick. Really enjoyed the canopied hiking and rushing creek.
140,2018-11-10,['hiking'],"absolutely gorgeous. after a set of switch backs, you follow a stream all the way up to the falls which offers a nice tranquil sound for the entire hike.  You also see some amazing views of the mountains throughout. The hike is fairly challenging in a few places! younger children probably wouldn't be the best to bring here, but older kids would be okay. One of the best hikes I've done!"
141,2018-11-09,['hiking'],Amazing views all the way up. Missed peak fall by a week. Trail wasn’t marked very well but it looked like all variations lead to the same point. Phone was at 1% couldn’t record down.
142,2018-10-30,['hiking'],"My favorite trail so far for Autumn colors, I went with my friend on Sunday. Very friendly trail as well enjoyed seeing everyone out with their dogs and children. Everyone greeted one another and said good morning. "
143,2018-10-26,['hiking'],Beautiful creekside trail especially in the fall. It is moderately challenging if you are not in shape. I personally love this hike and repeat it quite often.
144,2018-10-07,['hiking'],Amazing views and the fall colors were breathtaking. We had an amazing day.
145,2018-10-06,[''],"We went to perfect timing with fall leaves and weather. At the top (waterfall) , it can get cold so we were glad we had a good jacket (next time I will bring gloves for my kids hand). Good thing we had a friend who knew exactly where to find the location, it can get little tricky off HWY 89.  We started to hike around 3:30pm and were able to catch the sunset by 7pm. It is dog friendly but little kids may need help to go all the way. Even if you don’t go all the way, it is fun to bring family there. I was told every season this hike is different. Probably not in mid summer where it can get really hot (unless hiking in the early morning). Can’t wait to return back again."
146,2018-09-29,['hiking'],Beautiful Fall hike. Loved the parts along the creek.
147,2018-09-25,['hiking'],Bring a change of socks if you don't want squish foot. This is worth the climb.
148,2018-09-24,[''],Wonderful hike. A little technical in some places.
149,2018-09-23,['hiking'],"amazing trail if you need something to kick your butt. the first little section is a bit awful just because of the dust and switchbacks but once you're past those, it's all beautiful and shady! dogs are free to roam off the leash and mine loves all the water along the way."
150,2018-09-21,[''],its uphill the whole way good times beautiful waterfall. beginners were at that are we there yet about 3/4 way. lolz. so worth it. well worn trail.
151,2018-09-16,['hiking'],Lovely hike to a beautiful waterfall. i enjoyed hiking by the stream and seeing all the beautiful little cascades of water and mini waterfalls.  We started early but I can imagine when it is hot the first part would be a beast! The information we read said dogs were welcome if on a leash...I saw lots of dogs and none of them were on a leash!  The dog poop along the trail left by inconsiderate dog owners was a real distraction to this beautiful trail!  Come on dog owners pick up after your dogs or don't use this trail!
152,2018-09-12,[''],Great hike to a beautiful waterfall.
153,2018-09-11,['trail running'],"Great hike / trail run. 3.9 miles from the Parking lot, 1.5 hours. Good workout"
154,2018-09-10,['hiking'],"There are three parts to this hike.
Part 1: Walking up switchbacks on sand (!) with a city view behind you (also Bonneville Shoreline Trail)
Part 2: Very nice hike along Adams Creek in shade on dirt-and-rock path
Part 3: Do-able scramble up large rocks

It is about 2 miles from the parking lot to the falls and took 1 hour. (We are average 20-something Utah transplants and it was a lovely fall morning.) So in total, about 4 miles or 2-2.5 hours. It is incline the whole way in and decline the whole way out.

The reviews here that say 3.4 miles total I believe stopped at the first little waterfall that kind of runs through a couple large boulders. When we got to that, my watch said exactly 1.7 mi. — The others that include pictures at the base of an actual waterfall did the 1/2 mile or so large rock scramble that comes after that initial falls.

Our dog loved this trail. Going in the morning was awesome because it was the perfect temperature before it started getting hot, and the trail was noticeably busier on the way back. Everyone on the trail was super courteous and friendly.

The parking lot is really uneven and rocky, but was very nice to have and more than enough space for the 8am to 10am crowd."
155,2018-09-07,['hiking'],Pretty steep the way up.  Gets to a tree line and then all shade walking by the river.  Keep winding up to a horseshoe turn right eventually and you’ll find the waterfall.
156,2018-09-03,[''],Great out and back hike. Falls at top are beautiful.
157,2018-09-03,[''],This is one of THE best hikes I have been on. The scenery is amazing. A beautiful running creek flows alongside most of the trail. The reward of this hike only gets better as you reach the breath taking waterfall at the top.
158,2018-08-31,['hiking'],My first hike in Utah! Definitely was a little bummed at first with the dust and switchbacks but after that it's beautiful! Shady and nice scenery. Get diversity of rocks and dirt trails and the waterfall at the end was pretty. Plenty of places to stop for a sip of water for both me and my pup!
159,2018-08-27,[''],Great trail. Some steep parts but very scenic and full of nice people.
160,2018-08-26,[''],This was a fun trail. I would recommend shoes with plenty of grip. There are plenty sections of the trail where it's loose dirt and it's easy to lose your footing. Moderate is a good rating. The trail has plenty of areas that will elevate your heartrate!
161,2018-08-25,[''],This was a very enjoyable hike. Not the best for the first half a mile but after that you follow the river most of the way and there are 4 water falls on this trail with the last one being the best. I'm ready to do this one again. one of my favorites.
162,2018-08-22,[''],great place to hike. many dogs off leash and very cool people. river runs along with trail for a lot of the hike and some great shade once you get into the trees. Beautiful and a lot of fun. My dog Shenzi had a wonderful time and I got a great work out. I would recommend it to anyone!!!
163,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"This trail is really pretty; the first 1/2 mile is hot, but once you hit the shade, it is rather pleasant.  The hike along the creek is cool with plenty of opportunities to cool off if you choose.  The final 1/2 mile to the waterfall is a little steep, but it is completely worth it in the end.  The trail is heavily trafficked, so if you are looking for seclusion, this is not the place."
164,2018-08-17,[''],Had a great hike. Gets a little step and rocky before the waterfall.  It's quite refreshing once you get there. My 6 year old was able to make it.
165,2018-08-10,[''],First part of trail .5 miles is all sun and you feel like your in the desert.  Then it turns along the river and all shade.  Nice to follow river up to waterfalls.   Waterfall is nice and you can splash around before heading down.
166,2018-08-10,[''],Oldie but goodie. Not too difficult for the most part. The last half mile or so may be a little challenging for kids.
167,2018-08-09,['hiking'],This is my son's favorite trail.  We have to do it every year.  I have to admit with the heat I was not looking forward to it.  Leaving later in the day was really pretty nice.  The creek kept the heat down and the traffic was not too bad.  Watched a great sunset on the way down.
168,2018-08-08,[''],"This a beautiful hike but I am 60 and in pretty good condition and I would call this hike hard.  There were lots of young people but not a lot of older adults (senior).  As you get to the top you are climbing through the rocks at a fairly steep incline.  That being said the payoff at the end, the falls, are amazing.  It was worth the climb definitely."
169,2018-08-08,[''],Beautiful
170,2018-08-08,['hiking'],"Great hike, shady most of the way. Really fun waterfall at the end that makes it all worth it!"
171,2018-08-05,[''],"I absolutely love this trail! It is a beautiful scenic hike with some challenging parts. The switchbacks are rough in the beginning since it is a steep incline. After that, make sure to go right when the trail splits, and then stick left close to the mountain all the way up to the waterfalls. There is a small waterfall before the large one. It is only about an extra ten minutes to the large waterfall once you hit the small waterfall. There are steep parts on the trail and toward the waterfall, I was almost rock climbing. The hike was challenging but very fun! There is always a place to stop and rest, too. I love hiking up along the side of the stream. Getting to the final waterfall was definitely worth it!"
172,2018-08-01,[''],love this trail.  tried it as a beginner and made it to the top.  now I come a few times a year.  my kids love splashing in the water up at the waterfall
173,2018-07-29,['hiking'],"This trail is rated moderate but there are parts that are hard! The switchbacks at the beginning of the trail are tough because it is a steady incline and sandy. Once you get closer to the waterfall, there are some very steep parts that are borderline rock climbing/bouldering. With that being said, it was a fun and challenging trail."
174,2018-07-29,['hiking'],
175,2018-07-27,[''],Worth it to make it to the top! I’m an “older” hiker so I had to rest quite a bit but there was always a beautiful spot to sit.
176,2018-07-24,['hiking'],Me and my wife finally made it to the top waterfall.  The last few times we’ve tried she was 7 1/2 months prego and the next was with a 7 month old or so.  We left the kids home this time and got to the top. Awesome hike. I just wish people would pick up dog poop!!!!  If you have a dog pick up after it.....at least get the crap off the trail.
177,2018-07-23,[''],Awesome
178,2018-07-22,[''],"Great hike! Took my 12 year old and was very glad my 4 year old  wasn’t  with me. Is such a great hike along the river up to the waterfall. Some tough incline spots, but very well worth it!!"
179,2018-07-20,[''],The valleys and wildflowers are spectacular in spring. The uphill was in sections so not too much to take on.
180,2018-07-19,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. I went on my own in the morning. I saw a few people on the trail, it was a Tuesday morning. Coming up I came upon people trail running down. Go in the morning because the first part of the trail is completely exposed."
181,2018-07-17,['hiking'],"This was a great hike! I have done lower falls about 25 times with my kids, but never without them. I finally had a chance without kids to do this.  We started on the trailhead around 7:25 ish, and finished at 10pm.  It was 1.97 Miles to the waterfall, and ended up being a little less than 4 Miles total.  The 3.4 Miles is deceiving, and once you hit 1.7 Miles the rest of the way to the waterfall is difficult and the path isn’t clear.  It got dark before we got out of the canyon and n d d the help of a flashlight to see the rocks and path.

If you haven’t done it, do it! The waterfall is stunning and worth it.  This hike is equivalent to waterfall canyon trail in my opinion.  My kids (4 & 1) did waterfall canyon last year and it took 6 hours, I don’t think I will take them on this hike for another year."
182,2018-07-09,['hiking'],"We hiked this trail all the way up to the waterfall last Sunday with our two dogs and 4 year old son. The first part with the switchbacks is just sand and not covered at all so our dogs definitely struggled through that on the way up and back. Once you drop into the canyon it is covered for the most part with fairly easy access to the water where our dogs cooled off. There are some areas that made us a little nervous with tow dogs and a child but everyone did great. We clocked it at right around 6 miles up and back, but we also took a wrong turn on the way back down. The waterfall was beautiful and our son had a blast playing in the water at the top. I would definitely say take snacks or a lunch and enjoy the waterfall while you rest. Also take water! We thought we had enough and definitely could have used more. We did encounter areas that had a substantial amount of wasps but walking right through them was no problem and they didn’t bother us. Also saw one rattle snake on the way up but he was off to the side and moving away from us with no issues."
183,2018-07-08,[''],"I’ve done this hike several times and love it. Went today and there were quite a bit of wasps throughout the trail. Thought I’d leave a review for people who may have kids that are easily spooked. However, from my experience this is not the norm."
184,2018-07-08,[''],nice hike not to long not to short.
185,2018-07-06,[''],"First part is straight up a sandy path, which has little cover on a hot sunny day. Once you enter the trees, majority of hike is covered minus a few spots. Fairly difficult second half with rocks and incline, depending on your fitness level. We went late in day and other reviews are accurate, fairly crowded. Top is a nice waterfall with some areas to sit. Also areas throughout trail to sit and rest. Saw quite a few families with young children doing the hike, as well as dogs."
186,2018-07-05,[''],Very nice hike to a beautiful waterfall but too many people
187,2018-07-04,[''],"I love this hike with my whole heart! It’s kinda hard but absolutely WORTH IT! The waterfall is beautiful and the views are spectacular all along the way (once you get past the sandy switchbacks, of course) hIGHLY recommend. I went on a Tuesday afternoon and there was not that many people to pass, and no bikes passing either which is nice :)"
188,2018-07-03,['hiking'],"Steep and Sandy switchbacks at the start of the trail, but once you're back into the trees this hike has some great sights."
189,2018-07-02,[''],awesome hike! plenty of shade and Beautiful scenery!!
190,2018-07-02,[''],"I did this hike on Saturday (06/30). I was the hot guy I the blue shirt that said, ""Virginia is for Lovers"".

Great vibes on this trail. There's a good amount of ups and downs on this trail. Never give up, never surrender."
191,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"Pretty hike once you get passed the switch backs, downside is it’s always pretty crowded!"
192,2018-07-01,['hiking'],"The first 1/2 mile or so of the hike is just switchbacks in the direct sunlight, with sand under your feet. Once you hit the canyon, the hike is gorgeous! Lots of shade. Small elevation gain, so most people should be comfortable with this trail, if you’ve been on a few hikes already. There were plenty of families and kids on this trail, but it wasn’t overly busy. The waterfall at the end is very rewarding. I climbed all the way up and around, so I could stand at the top of the waterfall, right at the edge and look directly down it. So cool! It was a slight technical climb, so I doubt most people will do this. However, if you have any rock climbing experience, or are somewhat athletic, I recommend it. At the edge of the waterfall there are straps anchored into the rock, so you could rappel down if you brought a rope. Unfortunately I didn’t know it was there, so didn’t have my rope with me. We tried throwing a small one up to me, but it failed. So I climbed back down without rappelling down the waterfall. Though, I will be back later this summer to rappel down. Anyway, highly recommend this hike to anyone!"
193,2018-06-30,['hiking'],A lot of climbing but plenty of shade. It was a fun trail.
194,2018-06-30,['hiking'],"fun trail and shaded, pretty waterfall"
195,2018-06-27,[''],Its a great trail. The end is very rewarding and nice to see.
196,2018-06-25,['hiking'],Went on 6-23-18 at 6:30am and there was hardly anyone there. It is a moderate to hard hike with all the inclines. Waterfall and hike are absolutely gorgeous with lots of shade. Brought my dog and she loved it. We passed about 30-45 people on the way back. I’d highly recommend going as early as possible to miss the rush.
197,2018-06-18,['hiking'],"I love this trail, it was very fun and adventures throughout. me and my partner made it to the end where there is a very beautiful waterfall at the end much rewarding.  my first this year 2018."
198,2018-06-18,[''],"Great little hicking trail. very rocky by my 4 kids made it just fine ages 8, 6, 4 and 2 in a baby backpack."
199,2018-06-17,['hiking'],"This is a great hike if you want a quick escape.  However, there are a lot of people, so be prepared for that. I've gone in the early spring before and that was kind of fun... made it a little more exciting with the ice and mud :)"
200,2018-06-17,[''],"Beautiful hike, totally worth it. I got 4.5 miles total though on my Apple Watch and on the recording from this app so it’s more than what it says. It’s wasn’t bad at all after you got past the first part. There is dog poop because apparently people can’t pickup after their dogs, but it was still worth it!"
201,2018-06-17,[''],"I tripped down this hike about 8 times, but other than that beautiful hike!"
202,2018-06-15,['hiking'],"great hike and waterfall is nice at the end, lots of cool spots to climb rocks and get better views of the waterfall or scenic forest tops if you like to free climb. Annoying part is people leave there dog poop everywhere, and when they do use a doggie poop bag, they just leave the poop there on the ground in the bag. Some pretty inconsiderate people thats for sure."
203,2018-06-13,['hiking'],Great hike nothing to complain about on the trail. Always nice to get to the shaded area and the waterfall is still awesome
204,2018-06-13,[''],I have not made it to the waterfall yet but love this trail.  If you’re new to hiking at this altitude I would take it easy at the beginning during the switchbacks.
205,2018-06-11,[''],"This trail was awesome!! It was also 3.0+ mi up and 3.0+ miles back. This trail is 6 miles long to reach the big waterfall with ~1,700 elevation gain (according to strava). The trail is not well shaded for the first 1 mi, and it’s all uphill. Once you hit the stream it’s mostly shaded. Bring an extra jacket, water proof/resistant once you reach the top. The trail is also more moderate/hard once you hit the bigger stream/falls (~last 1.5 mi up), so no strollers. It is a difficult climb up for the last 1 mi, and not great for people who are clumsy, not paying attention, or those who are used to lower elevations. Overall- dog friendly, moderate/hard, wear good hiking shoes that you can get wet. We brought a 9 and 6 year old and they were struggling to hike uphill so much, on uneven terrain. Remember *yield to uphill traffic *. Thanks for reading!!"
206,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"Love this trail! It’s a popular one, and really beautiful. I would recommend hiking it in the morning, because even on a cool day you’ll break a pretty good sweat. My only complaint is that because it’s well populated, there is a decent amount of litter along the trail (as well as dog poop). Come on people, how hard is it to clean up after yourself?"
207,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"The trail is very rocky and steep in places. There are lots of shaded places to take a break. Give yourself plenty of time, the waterfall at the end is amazing."
208,2018-06-09,['hiking'],"Wow those switchbacks at the beginning are rough. I don’t usually have my asthma triggered from hiking, but I had to use my inhaler 3 times before getting to the top. Once we were on the trail it was pretty clear where to go. Kids and dogs did okay, but there are a lot of steep spots and rocks to climb. Didn’t make it all the way to the waterfall, but it was still fun."
209,2018-06-06,['hiking'],Nice pretty hike real rocky at top pretty water fall watch out for rattlesnake I all most ran into one
210,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"Great hike!  Was able to easily do with my 9 year old.  Exposed to the sun in the switchbacks but shaded once you reach the canyon.  Several spots to cool down in the creek too.

The only complaint was a minority of dog owners who were irresponsible in not picking up after their pets.  This is a very busy trail, requiring everybody to do their part in keeping it clean for those that follow."

213,2018-06-03,['hiking'],Fun trail! it does get steep and kind hard at the top. Bring good shoes because you will need to climb rocks and boulders. I brought my dog and he had a great time.
214,2018-06-03,[''],"Took dog, very much moderate but plenty of break spots along the way to a nice waterfall. Lots of rocky spots, wear good shoes and take it slow (some were loose)."
215,2018-06-03,['trail running'],"One of my favorites because it gives you a huge varieties of challenges.  Towards the waterfall you will encounter a little rock scaling but nothing to severe.  
Weekends tend to be a little crowded but most hikers are courteous and will give way.  Lots of puppies including mine will be out on the trail.  

Happy Trails..."
216,2018-06-01,['hiking'],"Our family of five really enjoyed our first hike in Northern Utah today! We took the trail to the right to check out the Lower Canyon waterfall and really enjoyed playing around the falls. It took us about an hour round trip, and was the perfect way to spend a morning!"
217,2018-06-01,['hiking'],"We loved this trail! For a family with young children, it was perfect. A great length and challenge. The switchbacks were steep, but not too difficult. Above the switchbacks, we took the trail to the right and went to the lower falls. There was one area where it was tricky getting our four- and two-year-old down, but our five-year-old was  a champ. It was really pretty along the whole trail, great views of the city, horizon, and mountains."
218,2018-05-30,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike, but not as pretty as it used to be. The popularity of this trail shows in the amount of litter up this canyon. Graffiti in the form of carving trees, logs and scrawling on rock faces also seems on the rise. I hike this canyon weekly so perhaps I notice it more than others.

Aside from the litter and graffiti, this canyon is beautiful! The trail is well maintained although rocky and runs right next to the river for the majority of the hike. It is also fairly shaded making late morning and early afternoon hikes fairly comfortable. Plan on 45-120 minute hike times up to the falls depending on your personal level of fitness. You will encounter other people and many dogs on this trail so not a place of solitude if that is what you seek. If you do take this hike, please take an extra bag and pack some litter out with you on your way down the trail!"
219,2018-05-29,[''],"Went up about 7pm yesterday (end of May) even after the rain was damp but not so muddy that we slid around or anything. After you get into the shady trees it is quite a bit darker so if you are planning on an evening hike keep in mind it will get dark earlier. Lots of climbing up boulders as part of the trail and once you reach the waterfall, just plan on feet getting wet in the shallow water that you’ll want to walk through. Beautiful views at sunset."
220,2018-05-29,['hiking'],First time going up there today. Very intense! The view is beautiful and the waterfall is worth the ruff terrain. Wear hiking shoes and take snacks.
221,2018-05-28,[''],"50 years old and not in shape, but steady persistence makes for a great day with the family!!"
222,2018-05-27,['hiking'],Whoa this hike was difficult. Being new to the area and still getting used to the elevation this hike kicked our butt. We made it though! The waterfall was absolutely worth it. Little purple butterflies everywhere it was picturesque. The way there was exhausting a lot of uphill and a couple areas where you climbed over rocks but nothing drastic. The way back was easy we flew back to the parking lot. Just a couple areas on the way down were steep and you had to be careful not to slip which I nearly landed on my back a few times if it weren’t for my skillz. Also when you see the bridge about a quarter of the way on the trail don’t go that way. We did for a while and had to backtrack. Which was dumb cause it should have been common sense to stay near the creek so we ended up on Bonneville which was a nice trail and cacti everywhere.. but yes if you see the bridge don’t continue on that trail. Good spot to take a break though! Bring lots of water!! And a snack/meal to reward yourself when you make it to the falls 
223,2018-05-25,['hiking'],Great hike.
224,2018-05-23,['hiking'],Great trail to take the kids and dogs. Get there early!
225,2018-05-21,[''],Beautiful!
226,2018-05-19,[''],"The first part of this hike is difficult due to the steep switch backs, then you get into the green and it is beautiful at every turn! It is steep in some areas with lose rocks, so go slow, and coming down was a bit scary. However I was doing this packing my 6 month old, so it’s possible. I’m a moderately in-shape person. Would not recommend this for young kids. It took my friend and I about 2.5 hours out and back while staying at the falls for a while."
227,2018-05-19,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail! Lots of trees to shade the trail. The creek runs along the trail the whole way. Great for dogs. The waterfall was the perfect end to this trail. If you want to go to the shoreline trail from there it is not accessible for dogs, it’s a steep rock climb up from the waterfall."
228,2018-05-17,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery! Great hike!
229,2018-05-16,['hiking'],"Great hike. Decently difficult, so come prepared. Really pretty views of the valley. Busier than I expected, but not too bad. I'll definitely be going again!"

231,2018-05-14,[''],Love this hike.
232,2018-05-14,['walking'],"Great hike, amazing waterfall at the end but my shoes did get wet to see it."
233,2018-05-13,[''],Amazing hike! Beautiful the whole way to the water fall. I would definitely rate it as hard though. A lot of uphill scrambling over rocks and cliff like areas.
234,2018-05-13,[''],So pretty! Go early in the morning on weekday and you’ll have no problems with too many people.
235,2018-05-12,[''],This is a great hike with a gorgeous waterfall! Very popular with hikers.
236,2018-05-09,['hiking'],Great hike.  We got to see an awesome sunset on the way back down.
237,2018-05-07,['hiking'],"This trail is amazing- but SO heavily trafficked. There were so many people on the trail- we had to walk single file for so much of it just because we were passing people constantly. There were many dogs off-leash and dog poop everywhere!! In addition there were many mountain bikers tearing around like crazy. I’d go again, but very early on a weekday and without any children."
238,2018-05-07,['hiking'],One of my very favorite hikes!  It was perfect!
239,2018-05-07,[''],grew up hiking this trail it is heavily trafficked now but I still love it !
240,2018-05-06,['hiking'],Loved every minute! Thought I had hiking shoes but slippery going down. Getting hiking shoes and doing it again!! This Texas girl doesn’t have anything like this!! I’ll be back soon!
241,2018-05-06,['hiking'],"GO EARLY! 

This trail is absolutely AMAZING...but everyone else thinks so too. We got there on a Saturday morning around 8:30 and there were maybe 30 cars. By the time we left a few hours later there were probably 150! 

This trail starts of with tons of sandy switchbacks and it is challenging. I probably wouldn’t take my 6yo, but it quickly gets shaded and is a real treat the entire way."
242,2018-05-06,[''],Great hike and beautiful waterfall! Only downside was how many people were on the trail.. it was quite crowded.
243,2018-05-06,['hiking'],Convenient hike for Davis County residents. Pretty. Good workout but lots of traffic - go early in the am.
244,2018-05-05,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite hikes. The beginning where the switchbacks are is the hardest part. The hike gets easier after that. I would not recommend bringing upping children. I need one water bottle up and down. It takes about 2-2 1/2 hours to hike. Depending on how long you stay at the waterfall.
245,2018-05-02,[''],"One of the best hikes in the Uintah/Weber County area. It's gorgeous once you're past the beginning switchbacks. If you're in good shape, it can be completed in about an hour + or - 30mins. This should not be rated hard. Malans Peak is rated moderate and it is much more strenuous. Great reward at the top. Water proof Hiking shoes to cross the creek is recommended."
246,2018-04-30,['hiking'],Once you get past the sandy switchbacks - it doesn’t get much better than this.
247,2018-04-29,[''],Love this trail pretty heavily trafficked but still beautiful and worth the hike
248,2018-04-28,['hiking'],The switchbacks at the beginning are rough but once you get past them it’s such an amazing hike. There is little to no littering and the streams are nice to cool off and enjoy. Everyone on the trail is always super nice and there are lots of dogs. It’s a really nice hike.
249,2018-04-27,[''],"I love this hike. It’s a nice distance for a quick hike and good workout. It’s shaded most of the way which makes this hike enjoyable for any time of day hiking. Hiking in the winter time is super enjoyable as well...climbing poles can be especially useful then can we helpful for occasional icy patches... Still, I go without them usually."
250,2018-04-27,['trail running'],"This is my go-to trail for running. Easily accessible and just the right amount of mileage and ascent for an hour run.

The first mile is exposed, don't forget protection and water. Kid and dog friendly so bring the whole family.

The switchbacks are tough, but once they are behind you beautiful canyon scenery with a waterfall at the end are your reward.

After you cross the bridge it's about another half mile climb over a rock field to get to the waterfall. Keep the river on your left and you'll be fine.

Saturday's are incredibly busy, so start early and be ready to face crowds of people. I usually run it on Sunday mornings and there are only a handful of other people."
251,2018-04-21,[''],Used Adam's Canyon Trail to get to Adam's Cabin Trail. Very difficult to get to Cabin Trail from Waterfall (Canyon) Trail. We enjoyed the challenge of it as we found ourselves in the middle of nowhere. Near the cabin the trail is covered by snow but we were able to use a previous hiker's footprints. Definitely will do it again but will use Adam's Cabin Trail. Missed the waterfall due to high water.
252,2018-04-19,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! Some bouldering at the end. Mostly dry. 

Not well marked. Kept getting lost/confused. My advice: follow the stream the entire way. You’ll be on the left for most of it then there’ll be a bridge taking you to the right side somewhere along the way. AllTrails thinks this trail is longer than it actually is. If you keep looking for a trail by the big waterfall, you’re probably not going to find it xD"
253,2018-04-19,['hiking'],love this hike! it's never too crowded but expect a few people around between 10-2. it's a nice work out all the way through.

Beautiful hike and will be returning."
257,2018-04-09,['hiking'],My husband and I loved this hike!  Took our two Chocolate Labradors and they had a blast! Tired dogs for sure!
258,2018-04-07,['hiking'],Awesome hike. My 5yo and 7yo were able to make it all the way to the waterfall. it's a tough hike but worth it. the trail is pretty busy. I think the hardest part of the hike is the very beginning.
259,2018-04-06,['hiking'],"It’s a very steady hike at the beginning but by the end it does get a little steeper. The hike is almost completely dry except for a minute at the end where you have to cross water to be able to see the waterfall.
For me the hike was about 5 hours total, with nice areas along the way to take breaks or eat lunch."
260,2018-04-05,['hiking'],"Canyon is beautiful. Very little snow, river is easily crossable - great time to be out!"
261,2018-04-05,['hiking'],"Nice hike. It was crowded for a weekday. Good for families, passed by a lot of kids. Lots of dogs and dog waste along the trail. Couldn’t find a trash to throw away my dogs waste."

269,2017-12-20,[''],"It's not as hard as they make it out to be once you ascend into the canyon. The waterfall is beautiful and the trail is nice, the only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is for the crowds that are common. Still a favorite"

274,2017-11-03,['hiking'],Loved it! It’s not as far as it’s posted it’s about 1.6 miles to the waterfall you can go further but it’s rock climbing. So worth it!
275,2017-10-23,['hiking'],"Awesome hike, hard at the beginning with the switchbacks but other than that pretty easy. "
276,2017-10-23,['hiking'],My dog and I do this trail frequently and I would recommend it to anyone. There are several different ways to get up if you are willing to explore. The sandy switchbacks in the beginning are the roughest part in my opinion. Great Waterfall if you complete the hike.
277,2017-10-22,[''],"We're visitors from CA and some friends turned us on to this beautiful river hike. Would have given five stars but found a lot of rubbish, a few carved up trees and the trails were poorly marked if even existent. Pretty sweet waterfall at the top. Fun little hike & will definitely do this hike again next time we visit."
278,2017-10-21,[''],amazing and spectacular right now with fall colors
279,2017-10-20,['trail running'],Pretty easy hike. The worst part is at the beginning with the switchback after switchback but other than that it was a breeze. It some very pretty views as well. It took my friend and me about 1 and a half hours to do round trip
280,2017-10-12,[''],Great trail
281,2017-10-04,['hiking'],"Grew up hiking this trail. Love love love it. Not sure why it has a hard rating though. I feel a moderate rating would be appropriate. Plenty of flat spots and moderate inclines. The steepest part is the switchbacks at the beginning (don't attempt in the heat. the sun will beat down on you and you will want to die).
The waterfall is a great reward at the end. There are some stream crossings so depending on the water level your feet might get wet.
Heavily trafficked. Great for families (the first part might tough on really little ones)."
282,2017-09-12,['hiking'],"We actually just hiked to the lower falls.  After the first set of switchbacks, just take a right after the bench, and follow it down to a gorgeous waterfall.  Great hike for kids!"
283,2017-09-09,[''],"It is better to hike this trail early in the morning.  It is a difficult hike but well worth it.  There is plenty of shade once you get past the steep switchbacks.  Bring plenty of water and be ready to sweat.  This hike is strenuous at best.  Watch your footing because it's easy to roll an ankle.  If you're looking for amazing scenery and want a great workout, then this trail is for you."
284,2017-09-05,[''],Love this trail
285,2017-09-04,[''],"This hike is fun and varied, but takes much longer with small children or older adults. We had a three year old and a 57 year old grandma. It took us 5 hours round trip. Take lots of water and good shoes!"
286,2017-09-04,['hiking'],my 2.5 yr old did fantastic on this trail. very beautiful and lots of great views.
287,2017-09-04,['hiking'],Nice hike you think you're physically doing good until you head back down and then you realize how steep this trail really yes but definitely worth the hike absolutely beautiful
288,2017-09-04,[''],"Once you get past the switchbacks there is a lot more shade, but I will definitely bring more water next time or start earlier.  We started at 4 and it was way too hot but that was all that worked with all the family."
289,2017-09-03,['trail running'],Great trail!  The sandy switchbacks at the beginning and the steep climbs toward the end make this a challenging trail run.  Watch out for rattlesnakes in the sunny areas in the evenings.  I've seen two this summer.
290,2017-08-31,[''],This is one of my favorite hikes! I love hearing the water flowing in the river throughout the hike and the Beautiful waterfall is fun to get wet in after getting hot and sweaty! Great trail... be sure to wear shoes you can get wet. There are also so great sitting places to eat a snack or lunch. 
291,2017-08-28,['hiking'],"This is an incredible hike and has huge payoff. If you are doing this in the summer, I would suggest going in the early morning. There is some shade once you are in the canyon, but it can still get toasty."
292,2017-08-24,[''],this hike is a little hard it's got some switchbacks and some rocks you need to climb but if you take it slow the large fall at the top is worth it. there are two Little Falls and a creek that you see on the way up to the top.  it's a busy Trail so if it looks like you're going to get lost lots of people to help you get on the right track
293,2017-08-24,[''],Tough beautiful hike
294,2017-08-19,[''],Excellent trail with diverse conditions. It was good for my family to hike up on clear paths and then get into scrambling over rocks the last .5 mikes to the falls. The falls are amazing. Coming back is perfect for a trail run on the downhill. The stream offers a constant and natural AC.
295,2017-08-14,[''],"Great hike, Saturday's are for the boys.!!"
296,2017-08-14,['hiking'],I didn't think it was too difficult.  Took a 7 year old and he did great!
297,2017-08-12,['hiking'],"A good waterfall to look at or to cool off in the summer if you like the cold water. I like running up the trail, but be careful there are a few narrow and steep spots. My youngest boy has done this hike at 5 years old."
298,2017-08-08,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite hikes in the area. At the beginning of the hike there are a few steep switchbacks. However, after getting passed those it becomes fairly even the rest of the way. 

There are a lot of trees along the trail so they provide some nice shade when hiking through it. The canyon walls help keep you in the shade as well. There are a couple of parts towards the last stretch of the hike that can be slick and do get a little steep so stay cautious. 

At the end of the trail you're greeted to a beautiful waterfall. Be prepared to get your feet wet and cross the creek. Be careful when doing so because wet rock can be very slippery. Once across take a break and enjoy the view. 

If you're hiking later in the day I recommend bringing a light jacket, even if it's warm out. It can be pretty cool near the waterfall and there's always a mist of water that will cool you down."
299,2017-08-07,['hiking'],"This trail is great for a short hike! Started at 6pm, spent 30 minutes at the waterfall, and got back to the trailhead at sunset (9pm in mid-July). I rated four stars because (a) there were a few unmarked forks in the trail and (b) I slipped on a rock and slid down a rocky slope into the creek. It was more humorous than anything else, but it was inconvenient. Overall tho, this was a really fun hike with a great reward at the end. Also, coming back down, the view of the sunset was spectacular! I would divide this trail into four parts:
1) The trailhead parking lot, a short walk along a chain link fence, and then a lot of sharp switchbacks. This section climbs up the side of the Wasatch Range foothills and provides a nice warmup that mades the rest of the hike seem easier. There's some good views of the Salt Lake Valley along the climb.
2) After reaching the top of the foothills, the trail levels out into a fairly level and grassy stretch. This is were the view of the sunset was. It provides a great vantage point across most of the Salt Lake Valley, as well as a nice rest after the steep switchbacks. This is where the trail merges with the Bonneville Shoreline Trail.
3) The bulk of the hike, after turning off of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail, climbs up thru Adams Canyon. There's not really any views worth mentioning until reaching the waterfall, but the end is worthwhile. As long as you watch your step, you'll be fine. I only slipped because I wasn't paying attention at the moment.
4) The waterfall. It was probably in the best little cove to view it that I could have asked for. The trail comes up from the southwest, you walk across the creek on rocks, and then see the waterfall. It's on the southeast side and falls into a pool that fills most of the cove. Unless you have rockclimbing equipment, the trail ends here; cliffs surround everything. There's a large sandy bar on the north side that you can stand on, and a 10-foot rocky perch on the northwest side, across the creek from where you come up and opposite the waterfall. Climbed it, great view of the waterfall, romantic spot; do it!"
300,2017-08-06,[''],"Fairly steep hike, but beautiful scenery. Waterfall is fun at the end."
301,2017-08-05,[''],"My wife and I just tackled this trail and it was beautiful! The hard rating is accurate, but still a rewarding hike. We hiked the 3/4 of the trail to the water fall but did not continue up to the top of the falls due to time constraints."

304,2017-08-01,['hiking'],"Second time I've done it.  First time was on a holiday and it was so crowded, almost like an asset line. Did it again last Sunday.  A few people but not many at all, multiple dogs (mostly off leash) but good hike.  We took lunch and took our time and just enjoyed the area.  18 month old lab was worn out by the end of the day which is awesome!"
305,2017-08-01,['hiking'],One of the best hikes we've taken.  We like it better in the spring when the water is a little higher.  This one is the kind you do over and over again.

307,2017-07-25,['hiking'],"I LOVE this trail. Great destination and beautiful hike. It's not a walk in the park, but definitely not too difficult for kids or dogs. Can get extremely busy during the summer. Go as early as possible or on a semi-rainy day. You can climb to the top of the waterfall if you're really ambitious."

312,2017-07-04,[''],Great hike. Beautiful scenery.
313,2017-07-04,['hiking'],Loved letting the fall water cool me off at the end up hiking up and following the river!
314,2017-07-03,[''],"Really enjoyed this one. Great with the kids . I'd try to get there earlier in the morning next time. We headed up around noon, and the sun really beats on you as you go up the switch backs. Once you get into the canyon it's covered and really enjoyable!"
315,2017-06-30,['hiking'],awesome trail.  Ran up and down this all the time.
316,2017-06-28,[''],This is a fun trail once you get past the sandy switchbacks. This trail is usually packed with people and parking can be a struggle on the weekends. Really nice once you get up into the canyon. Definitely worth the hike!
317,2017-06-25,[''],"Awesome hike! We went all the way to the top with our 2 year old. There were some pretty scary areas and areas our son couldn't do so his dad carried him on his shoulders. I was quite surprised to realize you could only see the fall by going through the water and around a giant rock! It was totally worth it though, we'll be back with our visiting family soon!"
318,2017-06-24,['hiking'],"Great, fun trail!  Something to take into account is the first portion is a sandy path in direct sunlight. If you're bringing a dog(s) make sure you're going early in the morning or in the evening or they have booties, because the path will burn their paws. 

Once you get to the river it gets nice and shady and the rest of the way is very nice. There's lots of great areas to dip your feet in an cool off for a rest.

There were some portions that having traction on my shoes would have come in handy, so make sure you're wearing something that can handle steep, dusty parts of the trail.

We don't hike often (okay, almost never) but still found this hike easier than we were expecting. Lots of friendly people along the way as well. If you're not as experienced like us then just make sure to plan ahead with good shoes and water.

If you plan on bringing your dog to this trail I highly suggest hiking it alone first so you can plan accordingly. There is absolutely no shade on the way up and lots of foxtails."
319,2017-06-22,['hiking'],"Pretty nice trail with the exception of Dog ish everywhere, the first 1/4 of the hike basically smelled like crap the entire way, kind of annoying to go on a hike out in nature and have to smell that for so long, I guess that's what you get when you go on a dog friendly hike, lesson learned, won't be doing it again."
320,2017-06-21,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike, I go once almost every week for exercise.  I love this hike, my only complaint are the inconsiderate people who refuse to take responsibility for their animal and the graffiti. Along the first part there are constantly bags of dog poo littered throughout it. I don't understand why some people will pick it up, but then toss the bag.  Besides that I love this hike."
321,2017-06-19,['hiking'],"we loved this hike. It was more difficult than we expected, but all of us made it, including the 7 year old. Parts of it were a scramble and some of it was nerve wracking for this mama. I would not have categorized it as a noderate hike, but would absolutley do it again."
322,2017-06-19,['hiking'],"This is definitely a scenic hike however the trail is extremely dangerous past the bridge up to the waterfall. The intensity of this trail, I think, should be re-categorized as hard. I could easily see severe injury or death as a reality on this hike. especially if you bring the littles. There are sharp rocks, steep falls, and narrow pathways that require you to grasp and hold on for dear life. It is not kid friendly past the bridge but up until then it's safe enough. if I hadn't brought my 10 yr old son then I wouldn't have been so paranoid but it's pretty hard"
323,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"absolutely fantastic hike, but I would probably would rate it hard instead of moderate"
324,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Great, tough hike. So many dogs on the trail though. Wish people would clean up after their pets "
325,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Fully sun exposed for the first 1/4 of the trail, leading into shaded woods once in the canyon. Best to start early and avoid midday sun when ascending the exposed section. It's a moderate family-friendly hike until the bridge at around 2/3 of the way to the falls. After the bridge I would call it a moderate-hard with minor rock scrambling. Although there were many children and carried babies on the trail, I would not call it family-friendly after the bridge. There are numerous steep sections where slips can lead to falls over small cliffs with serious injury. Before bringing children or infants, please hike the trail yourself and make an informed assessment of whether to bring them. It can get dicey at times for children. That said, reaching the waterfall is completely worth it. Recommend waterproof boots or bringing water shoes as you will be stream hiking around the waterfall. Trekking poles are very helpful."
326,2017-06-18,[''],enjoyable
327,2017-06-16,['hiking'],"this is a hard trail wjere you will be climbing rocks and traversing through rapids, but its totally worth it. it took us about 3 hours round trip with several breaks."
328,2017-06-13,[''],"the beginning is brutal, but you're hiking along the creek most of the way up so it's nice and cool and scenic."
329,2017-06-12,['hiking'],Beautiful like! 2 year old did it with some help on the scramble parts. Loved the falls at the end and the natural coolness by the river!
330,2017-06-12,['hiking'],"First time I went hiking was at Adams Canyon and it was great. It's rough in the beginning, mainly because you have to get up a hill to get to the trees and all the nice nature."
331,2017-06-11,['hiking'],Pretty busy trail on the weekends. Recommend trek poles and waterproof shoes/boots.
332,2017-06-06,[''],Really beautiful hike with low temperatures compared to the valley. Today the water was high and the final 50 feet has a rope to swing across or you can go through ankle deep water. It's only about 1.5 miles to the waterfall and is difficult to tell where the trail goes after that.
333,2017-06-05,['hiking'],"Water level at the falls was high.  When you see the rope, walk through the ankle deep water and you are there. Very nice this morning, fewer hikers."
334,2017-06-04,[''],I don't recommend taking dogs when it's really out out the trail is sand and it's really hot on their feet
335,2017-06-03,[''],"Great hike, little crowded but overall worth the wait for the waterfall at the top. Best time I find to go is early morning."
336,2017-06-02,['hiking'],This was a great hike! First half mile is a steady up hill with switchbacks over dirt/sand. After you cross the little bridge it's a nice climb to the falls. Very doable. My GPS clocked out and back at 4.2 miles.
337,2017-06-02,[''],The creek is really full in the spring. We had to get wet to see the waterfall. Many beautiful views of water along the way. Busy trail.
338,2017-06-01,['hiking'],"It was very fun trying to follow the trail, you can scramble up the waterfall rock face for a higher view."
339,2017-05-31,[''],"Wouldn't take my little kids on this for a couple weeks. The trail is washed out in several places. Otherwise, awesome hike and beautiful waterfall."
340,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"Truly great trail with beautiful sights. 
Only thing is there is quite a bit of uphill sand before you reach anything really worth seeing. 
It's uphill on the way to the waterfall and downhill back, not much variation that way. (idk how much that really matters except if you're considering skill level.) 
People take their dogs all the time and I've even seen someone bring a horse up there. 
Overall it's a great hike and I would recommend it. :)"
341,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"I've done his hike a few times with my four year old. It's perfect for tough little guys but bring lots of water and a snack. Gorgeous views, great shade, and multiple water falls."
342,2017-05-30,['hiking'],Good hike...even with a 3 & 5 year old.
343,2017-05-27,['hiking'],Great views and terrain. Feels like a few states in one hike
344,2017-05-23,['hiking'],"While this hike gets way too busy, it's definitely worth it!  The beginning and end are both steep, but the middle part of the hike isn't too bad."
345,2017-05-23,['hiking'],Beautiful Hike but busy trail.
346,2017-05-23,[''],Beautiful hike
347,2017-05-17,['hiking'],"went with a small group yesterday. the water was very high. if you want to go all the way to the falls, you will get wet a few times. the water wasn't really that cold. i hike in vibram five fingers and don't get cold easy. it snowed last nigh after we left. great time of the year to go as it wasn't really as dusty as it sometimes is. we went pretty slow and it took about 2.5 hours up and back."
348,2017-05-15,[''],"We were not prepared to walk through the freezing water, but worth it."
349,2017-05-15,[''],Love!
350,2017-05-14,[''],A great hike yesterday. There were a lot of hikers and the water was as high as I have ever seen it. We had a great time.
351,2017-05-14,[''],"the moderate rating on this trail is wrong, the first 1/3 of this trail is a series of steep Sandy switchbacks, then you break into the canyon and the trail comes right next to the stream (sometimes in the stream if water is high enough like my venture) until you begin climbing through rocky steep areas and tight wooded areas..

 The scenery here is awesome, every time the trees break it's another photo op/ good moment to break & take it in, I wish I had taken my stuff for a more serious hike, bring a second pair of water shoes, you likely will wade through water in the spring, it was a great hike, just definitely not rated correctly."
352,2017-05-12,[''],fun trail..very diverse terrain
353,2017-05-12,['hiking'],"I'm a beginner, I made it all the way to the waterfall. Great trail for all."
354,2017-05-11,[''],Maybe a little harder than moderate. You will get wet feet if you want to see the falls so take your shoes off for the last few yards.
355,2017-05-09,[''],Great time.  Good for most ages.
356,2017-05-08,[''],"I do this trail quite a bit! May be a little difficult when you first try, but becomes very easy and one is one of the ones I go to most. Very popular in Layton area."
357,2017-05-08,['hiking'],this hike is long and hard. it was an amazing but exhausting hike. I had my 6 year old son with me so it took us few hours to complete the entire hike to the waterfall and back. I wouldn't recommend taking children under 6. this hike should be rated hard and not moderate.
358,2017-05-01,['hiking'],very very fun hike. you may get a little wet..
359,2017-04-30,['hiking'],fun trail....great scenery
360,2017-04-27,[''],Loved this trail. Very beautiful.
361,2017-04-24,['hiking'],"The hike was great. It was mostly hiking up the hill. It's very steep in the beginning and at the end. But, it's worth to go till the end. Water was too cold as we went there before noon. Moderate traffic. Didn't see any restrooms at the start of the trail. Be hydrated and carry energy bars as beginners may get tired."
362,2017-04-22,[''],So incredible to have such a beautiful trail nearby.
363,2017-04-21,['hiking'],"The trail starts out with some sandy switchbacks that can be grueling.  They are exposed to the sun and relatively steep.  The sandiness gets worse toward the end of the year with wear.  But it is nice be rewarded with views of your immediate progress rising from the valley.  
After the switchbacks, the trail becomes very pleasant.  It is mostly shaded by foliage and runs along a creek.  The trail is well maintained with only a couple sections that could prove difficult to younger children to navigate.  My 9 year olds did not have any problems.
The waterfall payoff at the end is very nice.  Early in the melt-off  the water is higher and can result in wet feet at the final crossing to the waterfall.
My kids and I usually complete this hike in 2 hours.  I love that it is dog-friendly, though I wish people were more considerate about picking up after their dogs.  The biggest downside to the trail is how heavily the traffic is."
364,2017-04-20,[''],Best trail for exercise in the area.
365,2017-04-20,[''],great hike- at the end you have to do some boulder climbing.
366,2017-04-19,[''],"Done this trail twice now, once in July and once in April. In April the water at the top can be pretty high, so plan on getting your feet wet even with waterproof boots on. It's a great trail for dogs and our 1 year old Belgian Malinois loves it, but be prepared to encounter many, many dogs off leash. Definitely the best trail in the local area, but it's very crowded"
367,2017-04-18,[''],I think this should be consider a hard trail as it is all uphill definitely works out your calves and butt. It is definitely a good hike and you are by the river quiet often. Also be aware there is a lot of rocks to climb and when you get to the top you have to cross the river to see the waterfall. It gets busier the later you go.
368,2017-04-17,[''],Great trail so worth checking out. Go early if you want to avoid crowd. Just wish dog owners would pick up after they're dogs.
369,2017-04-16,[''],Love doing this trail. Beautiful and scenic.
370,2017-04-16,[''],Is my favorite 
371,2017-04-10,['trail running'],"love this trail, especially in the winter."
372,2017-04-04,[''],My favorite hike in Utah by far!
373,2017-04-02,[''],"Beautiful! There a couple forks in the trail, so make sure you know where you're supposed to go for sure. There are so many waterfalls along the way to make the entire trail gorgeous. You have to cross the water at the top to see the falls. You'll get soaked to mid calf, but it's worth it."
374,2017-03-30,[''],"Sweet trail! You do have to cross water at the top to see the waterfall (unless the rocks are in good placement), so wear shoes that you don't mind getting wet (also helpful to bring another pair for the hike down if you can. Soggy feet the whole way down was reeeeeaaalll fun). Don't get discouraged once you start hitting more and more rocks; you're almost there!"
375,2017-03-28,['hiking'],"It's hard, But definitely worth it! The waterfall is beautiful. Not too packed but a moderate amount of people!"
376,2017-03-22,[''],I really enjoyed this hike.
377,2017-03-21,['hiking'],Good hike.  Taking a southeast turn immediately after the first set of switchbacks leads to a network of small trails.  Continuing towards the creek leads to a small waterfall that requires backtracking or scrambling to return to the trail.
378,2017-03-19,['hiking'],Great trail. weather was good for early March.
379,2017-03-18,[''],"My absolute favorite Trail so far. Make sure you wear shoes that are waterproof, you have to cross the creek to get to the waterfall. It's so beautiful."
380,2017-03-16,['hiking'],"I was a fun hike! Got some good exercise, wasn't too hot the whole time, and it was beautiful. I went all the way to the top of the waterfall and near the top it was super icy and there was still snow, i also walked through the creek to get to the big waterfall but it was worth it! Just be careful coming down from the falls. I fell on my butt a few times!"
381,2017-03-11,['hiking'],Nice wide trail at the beginning with a number of switchbacks on a steep climb. When you start hiking in the canyon it's a constant climb until you get closer to the falls. Some packed snow on the trail today be chains helped a lot the last 1/2 when the trail really got steep. Climbed above the Falls on the left and went up the ridge to the Adams Cabin trail and returned back to the trailhead making it a loop. It was all bushwhacking between both trails but snow wasn't deep and it was hard packed because we hiked early morning. The climb up to the ridge was worth the views.
382,2017-03-11,['hiking'],Looking to possibly hike this one Sunday. I am curious what the current conditions are like being that we have had a significant rise in temperature. How much snow/ice is remaining at this point. I apologize this is not a review but before making the trip it would be helpful to know. Thank you.
383,2017-03-03,[''],Too crowded for my liking but a cool waterfall at the end
384,2017-03-03,[''],I went up today. With the snow it was super slick and the trail stopped before the waterfall. I can't wait to try it again though when the snow melts!
385,2017-02-14,['hiking'],one of my favorite hikes
386,2017-02-07,['hiking'],very icey but do able just use caution on the descent
387,2017-01-01,['hiking'],The waterfall at the end of this trail was breathtaking! Hiked it in late December and the snow added a bit of a challenge. Can't wait to hike this again I'm the warmer seasons.
388,2016-12-03,['hiking'],This was an amazing trail and the waterfall was beautiful. Hiked it during the winter so the snow was a great touch and made it a bit more challenging.
389,2016-11-16,['hiking'],"you would need good shoes for this there is A LOT of rocks! mostly uphill (of course) wouldnt recommend fpr children under 6, its dangerous. easy to slip and hurt yourself."
390,2016-11-14,['hiking'],"I really enjoyed this hike minus the fact I went up early on a Saturday and it was so busy. I definitely prefer this on a weekday. It was a little harder for my puppy since the end is fairly rocky and it was slippery for him trying to get up. I would say a easy hike, lots of little kids."
391,2016-11-14,[''],"Tons of off-leash dogs. All friendly but kind of annoying cause you never know if their dog is friendly.  
SUPER BUSY for a Sunday in November. 
The trail itself. Amazing."
392,2016-11-12,[''],Beautiful trail up to the waterfall. I took my 5 and 3 year olds and they made it all the way up and back down with little assistance. The switchbacks at the start are the worst part
393,2016-11-09,[''],it was ok
394,2016-11-07,[''],beautiful trail but heavily trafficked.
395,2016-11-06,[''],great trail!
396,2016-10-31,[''],"It's silly how many people use this trail,  avoid at all costs!"
397,2016-10-14,[''],Fun to hike in winter and summer!
398,2016-10-13,[''],Went with a group of friends and family on October 10th.  Loved it.  Only main concern several unleashed dogs.
399,2016-10-12,['hiking'],"Kind of new at this so just echo most of the last few posts. Hiked on 10 Oct, less than a dozen or so folks on the trail. Very nice mid morning hike. Nothing special needed here this time of year other than water. Saw what seemed to be regulars fast pacing and jogging some sections without anything at all. 

The falls is worth the trip to see. The very first part on the switchback from the trail head is a bit misleading, it gets better quickly after you enter the canyon.  

Can't wait to bring family back here and will do it again just to show them."
400,2016-10-09,[''],Just hiked this for the first time today. Decent hike and not too difficult- my 4 year old made the whole trip. Very crowded trail but room to pass so it's not obnoxious. Too many irresponsible dog owners though (poop).
401,2016-10-05,['hiking'],Beautiful views and has such a nice forest atmosphere with lots of water along the trail. The waterfall is worth the hike up 
402,2016-10-04,[''],Always love this hike!
403,2016-09-30,['hiking'],"great hike. waterfall is beautiful. 
did see a rattlesnake on the trail, so be aware.
i'm a dog owner and as there are limited trails in SLC where dogs are allowed, i was excited to take my pup along. however, i was extremely disappointed with the amount of dog poop on the trail. fellow down owners, pick up your dogs poop! don't ruin it for the rest of us."
404,2016-09-29,['hiking'],"First part of the hike is the sunniest as there's not much shady. The hike also doesn't get very exciting until later on in the trail. We went earlier in the morning and it wasn't that busy. The waterfall is gorgeous with lots of shaded areas and there's certain places you can find to picnic. However, by the time we came down (around noon), the heat was at its peak and my dog's paws started to burn so we put on his shoes to help with the hot pavement."
405,2016-09-21,['hiking'],"The beginning of the trail isn't exciting- once you hear the water and see the first waterfall (diverting) off the trail you know it's going to be good. 
Took my 2 wiener dogs and they did amazingly well! The waterfall and different colors of fall was so pretty! Some sharp rocks going up and down, just watch your step... "
406,2016-09-20,['hiking'],Definitely more difficult but incredibly beautiful. The first part of the trail was the most difficult because of the lack of shade. Definitely beat to get an earlier start.
407,2016-09-18,['hiking'],This is my favorite hike it is also the hardest because of the first part of the hike I don't think I'm strong enough to bring my son
408,2016-09-15,[''],I sprained my ankle on this trail and still give it 5 stars lol love it
409,2016-09-14,[''],aweeeeeeeesome!!!!   do it do it do it!
410,2016-09-08,[''],So fun! kind of a poular hike (lots of people) And has some great views along the whole trail. I would suggest hiking up and running down!
411,2016-09-06,[''],Extremely busy hike. Steep rock climbs towards the end. But really cool overall
412,2016-09-06,[''],"Great trail great hike ,lots of people on the trail both day and nigh .. 
I'v hiked this 4 times it my #2 on my best of 3 favorite hikes .
#1-Ben Lomond 
#2 -Adams Canyon 
#3- Wind Cave trail Logan canyon 
Awesome water fall at the end . It's a scramble in places .. But worth the hike"
413,2016-09-06,['hiking'],"This is a fun trail, but be cautious with small kids. There are parts of the trail that are difficult. I made it up and back with a 16, 15, 11, 5 and 1 year old. (The baby was in a back pack.) The 5 year old made it, but required some help on the steeper parts. The kids were good and tired when we finished. We did have a good time but this hike should be rated as moderate to difficult. Oh, and there's always lots of people on the trail. Overall, it's worth the climb and the waterfall is gorgeous."
414,2016-09-06,[''],Absolutely loved this trail! Shaded most of the way and beautiful views. A little crowded but definitely a hike I will be doing again.
415,2016-09-05,[''],"Crowded, kinda scrambly, but really pretty."
416,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, lots of shade. Path is along the creek the entire way. Switchbacks at the beginning can be tough, but pretty easy after that. Heavy traffic even earlier in the morning. Lots of runners on the trail. Went in August and didn't see any rattle snakes, but have heard many people do. Beautiful waterfalls."
417,2016-09-04,[''],"beautiful shaded trail, moderately rocky at the end, creek runs along trail. beautiful waterfall
*did see a rattlesnake on a rock ledge near the end*"
418,2016-08-30,['hiking'],"Worth hiking. Fun to run back down. Walking next to river makes it cool, with shade. Several falls along the way, one big one at the end probably 20 ft"
419,2016-08-30,['hiking'],Switchbacks at the beginning are rough. Not a bad trail after that. Dog friendly and well travelled.
420,2016-08-29,['hiking'],Excellent
421,2016-08-28,[''],"We are amateur hikers but we did this with my 6 and 11 year old daughters! The switchbacks were hot but once we got thru that, we were met with shade and running water. Its pretty easy going the first half and then the terrain gets a little rough. Maybe 20 minutes out from the Big waterfall, my 6 year old needed a lot of support to not slip on the rocks. The waterfall is GORGEOUS. If you can make it, dont turn around, Its worth making it to the end. We will definitely do this hike again but i wouldnt take inexperienced small children the full distance without an adult partner for assistance."
422,2016-08-24,['hiking'],My favorite hike.  Beautiful scenery all around as you make your way to the waterfall
423,2016-08-21,['hiking'],"My new local favorite! First 1.5 miles is pretty easy to a little moderate. Mostly shaded and right along the river. Last .25 miles is moderate to difficult, with a steep climb up rocks. I personally enjoyed it and my 8 and 10 year old did great. Probably wouldnt recommend that last stretch for elderly though. We hike a lot and got done in just over 2 hours (not counting lunch break at the top). You will probably need to carry your dog down the switch backs, its sandy and hot, but the rest they will be just fine. These were the easiest switchbacks we have done so dont let that scare ya!  Very fun will do again soon!"
424,2016-08-20,[''],"The waterfalls are beautiful along the way, don't turn around before you see the one at the end! Great workout, steep in some areas."
425,2016-08-20,[''],"This is rated as moderate, but it really depends on your skill level. I am a 63-year-old female who hikes once a week with a hiking group and it was definitely a challenge for me! I would rate it strenuous and would not take young children! There are many steep parts and lots of rocks to climb over! There are actually three waterfalls on the way... one small one, one that is more of a cascading waterfall. And the magnificent one at the end! At the end you must walk through the creek to get around where you can see the big waterfall! We hiked this trail on the 19th of August and it still had plenty of water in the creek!"
426,2016-08-18,['hiking'],beautiful place to be and a lot of people you see.
427,2016-08-17,['hiking'],Starts with unshaded switchbacks but once you get into the canyon it's beautiful and very easy going. Well used trail and good for the family.
428,2016-08-16,['hiking'],"The view is breathless, the sound of the river is very relaxing all the way to the Huge waterfall.  Some areas are a bit challenging but I would definitely do it again. The waterfall is gorgeous.  It took us awhile to reach there.  The hikers we met on our way were very helpful in guiding us. Love It!!"
429,2016-08-15,['hiking'],Pretty easy trail with a nice waterfall at the end.
430,2016-08-15,['hiking'],"Adams Canyon is a great hiking trail for most ability levels. It can be completed from start to finish in about 3 hours tops. Once you get closer to the top though, there are a few climbing obstacles that can get kindof challenging, but not too bad. I have seen quite a few little children on this trail (ages 3-5ish) with their parents, although I would not advise taking your younguns unless they are able to climb fairly well on their own. What's nice about this trail is it's nice no matter what time of day you decide to go. The switchbacks in the beginning can be uncomfortable if it's a hot day, but they only take about 20-30 minutes to get through before you reach the canyon where it's nice and cool, and shaded throughout the remainder of much of the trail. A beautiful waterfall is your reward for reaching the top! Be advised that you WILL need to cross the river in order to actually see the waterfall, so be prepared to get wet. Take a pair of water shoes if you have them so you don't have to take off your shoes, or hike back down in wet socks and boots. Also, I would recommend taking a bottle or two of water as well."
431,2016-08-14,['hiking'],Once your passed the switch backs and into the mountains and shade that hike was awesome. Very pretty the whole way up.
432,2016-08-13,['hiking'],"Fun and exhausting, lots of sun and sand for the first bit but once you're in the mountains it's gorgeous."
433,2016-08-12,['hiking'],We only got to the small waterfall but it was beautiful! :-)
434,2016-08-11,[''],Love it!
435,2016-08-09,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, hot the first part, but once you get to the trees and river it is just beautiful. A note to dog owners: we cleaned up approximately 12 BAGS left along the trail and thrown in the trees, dog poo will decompose, the plastic bags used to pick up dog poo does not. PLEASE be responsible with your dog. If your dog poops on the trail, bag it and take it home to throw away, (hook it to your dogs collar if you don't want to carry it yourself.) If you didn't remember to bring a bag, kick it to the side, bury it. PLEASE DON'T bag it and leave it as litter. Places we can take our pets is very limited, more trails are becoming ""no dogs allowed"" due to places becoming trashed. Be respectful to other hikers. Sincerely,  those of us who would like our dogs to be welcome to go places with us."
436,2016-08-04,['hiking'],Awesome diverse trail with beautiful scenery and spots of challenging climbs.
437,2016-08-04,['hiking'],Absolutely gorgeous canyon with so many evergreens!  Switchbacks are dry and hot/windy at times but once you get up into the canyon its just amazing.  It has a good amount of foot traffic and is a bit too crowded for my liking however.  This makes it pretty slick in the winter as the trail gets packed down and freezes over........but it makes for a fun time sliding down.  I love to try to do this trail when it won't be crowded.......... Saturdays are a lil nuts.  But the waterfalls are definitely worth the hike!
438,2016-08-01,[''],This trail is pretty amazing and beautiful. Its kind of hard with little ones in some areas. But the waterfall made it all worth it :)
439,2016-07-30,['hiking'],"Nice hike. To me this is an easy trail. Some difficult spots, but overall short trail."
440,2016-07-28,['hiking'],"I absolutely love this hike! It has beautiful views and is nicely shaded for the majority of the trail and It's challenging enough to make it fun! Keep an eye out for snakes though, this season alone I've seen five rattlesnakes directly on the trail."
441,2016-07-27,[''],"Good hike! Quite intense though, with a nice waterfall at the end."
442,2016-07-23,['hiking'],"Love this trail.  Lots of spots to cool off in the river along the way. Lots of shade along the last 3/4 of the hike,  first part is open and can be very hot. Great for dogs. VERY BUSY!!!"
443,2016-07-23,[''],"Fun trail, but really crowded on the weekend..."
444,2016-07-23,['hiking'],Great hike and beautiful. Keep an eye out for rattlesnakes though. Saw one sunning himself on a fallen tree near the stream on 7/17/2016 at about 11am. My mom is a nurse and said that every rattlesnake bite that she had seen except for one was from Adams.
445,2016-07-21,['hiking'],"Excellent place to go on a hike. The end id very rewarding. This hike in my opinion is more difficult than moderate but I am a novice hiker. Bring lots of water with you. Get ready for some steep slopes and a lot of climbing near the conclusion of the hike. Don't turn back, get to the waterfall at the end. It is very rewarding."
446,2016-07-17,[''],Great family trail. The beginning is a little tough for beginners but it gets easier
447,2016-07-17,['hiking'],Great trail. Strenuous switchbacks in sand for the first 1/4 mile. Then you enter the canyon and it is a moderate beautiful hike. Falls along the way with the largest falls at the end of the trail. Just keep going it is worth the result.
448,2016-07-17,[''],"A little bit harder on the moderate side, the sandy switchbacks at the start are rough, but once you really hit the trail it's a lot better. Great views going in to the canyon the waterfalls are totally worth it."
449,2016-07-16,[''],Awesome
450,2016-07-16,['walking'],It was a nice trail just supper dusty all in all worth the hike for sure 
451,2016-07-15,[''],"We took our kids ages 8, 6, 3 & 4 months.  Most of the hike is moderate, but becomes more moderately strenuous towards the end, especially with kids.  We had a great time!"
452,2016-07-14,[''],Not to busy in an early Saturday afternoon. Made it up and back in an hour and a half. Did not stop and was going at a fast pace.
453,2016-07-13,[''],Fun trail but it's always way too crowded on the weekends.
454,2016-07-13,['hiking'],"Hiked with my four kids, ages 11, 10, 5, and 3. Pretty intense for my three year old but she did it all! Shady and by the river most of the way. Beautiful. Could just do a portion if time/ability don't allow to go all the way to the fall. Took us 3 hours and 45 minutes at a slow three year old pace. Will definitely do again!"
455,2016-07-11,['hiking'],It was good. I like any trail with water. Very steep climb all 2 miles up. I would like to hike along the water the whole length next time. Looking forward to winter to snow shoe this one.
456,2016-07-11,['hiking'],This is always a good out and back hike. It is a well traveled trail and there are a lot of dogs. It is very rewarding to play in the waterfall at the end on a hot day.
457,2016-07-11,['hiking'],"amazing hiking,with a beautiful view and beautiful water fall."
458,2016-07-11,['hiking'],"It was a quick, semi-difficult trail with varying features. The fall was unexpectedly refreshing."
459,2016-07-09,['hiking'],Hike early in the morning. Beautiful waterfall at the top!
460,2016-07-08,[''],"great hike, the first 30 minutes is no shade,  so it gets hot really fast, but then you get in the forest and you can refresh yourself by the river while you make it to the waterfall,  it's a 2 hour hike total"
461,2016-07-07,['hiking'],"It's pretty steep I took an 8 y/o, two 7 y/o, and 1 11 month old child. It was definitely a good workout and the kids loved it. Had some rocky parts so if you take kids just beware of that. Also it  gets confusing when you get to the top and the trail seems to just disappear. You'll cross a bridge in the river and see a big rock wall and you can go up and around it to see the waterfall...or go down and climb up around the rock wall. you'll find a small waterfall once you're around that rock. If you want to see the bigger waterfall then keep hiking for about 10 more minutes."
462,2016-07-07,['hiking'],Switch backs in the beginning are hard but after you are pass that it gets better. Enjoyed the hike!!
463,2016-07-07,['hiking'],"This trail is way too over hiked. Very dusty and trampled by hundreds of people each day. It is the most popular hiking trail in all of Davis County. It is extremely convenient and the trail head is easy to find. It offers an awesome workout with a pretty sweet waterfall, but just too congested for me."
464,2016-07-06,['walking'],Steep in the beginning but overall nice trail. Beautiful at the top. Hiked with my 7 year old.
465,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"The switch backs in the beginning are exhausting, but once you get past that, it's a good trail. Unfortunately having my 3 yr old in the backpack carrier, we couldn't get to the waterfall. We will be back!!"
466,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"I was very impressed by this short trail. Great scenery for a two mile hike. Some switchbacks at the beginning but then you enter the trees shortly after that. We went on July fourth and there were around 150 people on the trail. It really wasn't too crowded, though, but certainly busy. There are several small waterfalls the way up and the one at the top was quite large. There were people repelling just to the right of the falls which was cool. We climbed from the falls up to the peak and that was a somewhat difficult hike/easy climb but the view of the valley was well worth it."
467,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"I just went yesterday with some of my boys (11-15) and it was great.  It has a very nice variety. A  little strenuous, a steep climb or two, a few places where you have to be careful., some time in the sun, a few places, where you get your feet wet but mostly shaded.  The water and waterfall were beautiful.  it took us just about three hours (at a good, average pace). I highly recommend it.  Trails is pretty easy to follow, it does intersect with the Bonnevile Shorleline Trail, so don't get diverted."
468,2016-06-27,[''],"""Lightly trafficked"" is a pretty misleading statement. We hiked this trail during the week and there was still at least 100 people, which is no problem! But when you're looking for a little seclusion...that many people on one trail can be overwhelming. I was very disappointed with the amount of dog feces on the trail as well. The unpleasant smell takes away from the beauty and natural smell of the wild flowers. Aside from that, the scenery was beautiful and the reward of the falls was great."
469,2016-06-25,['hiking'],"Fun, challenging trail, some steep switchbacks to begin and then some other steep spots along the way with rocks and boulders to maneuver around. The waterfall is real pretty. Worth the effort to get there."
470,2016-06-25,['hiking'],Nice trail. Hiked it with the family on the 24th of June. There are some switchbacks at the beginning that kind of suck. The waterfall at the end os beautiful.
471,2016-06-23,['hiking'],"Made it to the 1.5 mile mark, I will be back.  Saw a baby rattlesnake on the trail at about 6:45pm at the 1 mile mark.  Awesome challenging hill climb to start, and a few good ups thereafter.  Lots of people on a trail for a Tuesday evening."
472,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"Loved this hike! I was looking for something slightly longer than I was used to and this was perfect. There were a couple of times where we questioned if we were going the right way, but there were a good deal of people up there so we ended up following people a couple of times. It splits off near the beginning so make sure you go to the left and not down the Bonneville shoreline. You do have to walk through the water to see it, though, so be ready to get your feet wet. I loved the waterfall, though!"
473,2016-06-21,['hiking'],First time on the trail today. Started at 9:00 am but should have gone earlier cuz it got hot!  Bring lots of water! First time I've emptied my 2 liter camelback on a hike. Lots of friendly people along the way. I wouldn't recommend for young kids!!  I got lost a few times & had to backtrack. The water was beautiful & refreshing. Your shoes will get wet as you have to cross the creek to see the final beautiful waterfall. Had to hike...crawl...over a few large boulders too. Overall - Beautiful! Challenging! Refreshing 
474,2016-06-20,['hiking'],The zig zag up hill in the beginning is a little hard to get up so I like to stair at the ground and push myself to keep going. I know once I'm passed that it gets easier. You fallow the trail to the right side of the mountain. Hikers walk along a running creek through dirt and rocks. Some rocks are obstructing the path and need to climbed over or you can walk in water around them. The hike is mostly up hill. There are a few good spots along the way to rest. I did get lost off the trail towards the waterfall and did some rock climbing but it was really easy. Got right back on the trail. Two waterfalls on this hike actually. One is smaller but not too much before getting to the main waterfall. I loved the views! I would highly recommend this hike!
475,2016-06-20,[''],"This is a 5.5 mile out & back hike, according to my app. Great work out, amazing waterfall & view. Bring lots of water, it takes a little over 3 hours (break @ waterfall included) when hiking with children."
476,2016-06-20,['hiking'],"I just went on this trail today with a good friend of mine. Easily the best hike I've ever been on. Great scenery, wonderful friendly people, and a good overall workout with a great reward for making it halfway and to the end. It was a pretty easy hike, though there are some climbing areas. Last but not least, there is some great areas to rock climb no-gear if you are experienced enough, giving you a great view."
477,2016-06-19,['hiking'],"Much harder then I expected. The last quarter mile, after the bridge is much more difficult than the rest, although the first bit is steep. The hike, over all, is beautiful and worth the time spent. You do have to cross the water at the end to see the falls, either get your shoes wet or take them off for the last 50 feet. My children did the hike, youngest being 7. I thought he would beg to be carried, but he made it on his own the whole way up and back."
478,2016-06-17,['hiking'],"The trail begins with dusty switchbacks and quite a lot of dog poop.  You really need to watch where you step.   We went on a weekday and it was very crowded.  The scenery was beautiful, but I'd prefer to drive further into a canyon for a less traveled trail."
479,2016-06-16,[''],beautiful
480,2016-06-14,[''],One of my favorites. Easy to get to. trails easy to follow. Great to hike or run. Beautiful waterfall at top.
481,2016-06-13,['hiking'],"What a hike!  It was my first time hiking, so I didn't know what to expect terrain-wise and I've read the reviews before I decided on the Adam's Canyon trail. If dogs and children can do it, why not me? It's not as easy as it looks. The first 15 minutes or so were spent climbing uphill and then it levels out which is nice. I only did about half way before turning around because some of the terrains were rough and I'm pretty sure I need a walking stick to climb that terrain. Also, there were quite a few places that has water involved and water in my shoes wouldn't be good for hiking. So I'll just have to come back another time with proper equipment. Overall, it was a great hiking trail."
482,2016-06-13,[''],awesome trail along river and waterfalls. absolutely beautiful.
483,2016-06-13,[''],Great trail! Needs some help with dog poop removal by owners. But would definitely do it again in a heartbeat. The waterfalls are amazing!
484,2016-06-11,['hiking'],"great workout,  fun hike,  wonderful scenery,  waterfall at the end is great ...way too many people though.  go first thing during the week for less traffic.   it is much father than what this app indicates.  at least 5 miles round trip."
485,2016-06-08,[''],"We did the first waterfall (family friendly route) and it was great! After about 10 switchbacks, take the 3rd right trail and you will make it to a secluded waterfall. About 1.5 miles round trip. We had two little kids with us and they did great!"
486,2016-06-08,[''],Love this hike! Good workout!! Friendly people!
487,2016-06-08,[''],awesom
488,2016-06-05,['hiking'],"This trail was harder than I expected as it is tagged as easy on the page. There are some sandy switchbacks to start the hike which were rough, but then it leveled out for a bit. Towards the end it got really rocky and steep. Lots of people on the trail which made it hard to take it slowly. Due to time constraints I didn't make it to the top, but am going back again. Beautiful scenery!  Cool temps once you get in the canyon."
489,2016-06-04,['hiking'],This trail is just south of Hill AFB. Very enjoyable incline and scenery.  Would bring extra socks as the trail crosses water on occasion.  Very popular so it can be crowded.
490,2016-06-03,['hiking'],Steep trail with lots of water. Trail is shaded. It's a very popular trail so much so expect lots of hikers. Recommend waterproof shoes or water shoes for water crossing.
491,2016-06-03,['hiking'],"This was a great trail. Beautiful views, but way to many people on 
weekends."
492,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"Hiked this for the first time today with my wife and 16 month boy in a backpack. With 30 extra pounds on my back this was a hard hike with some difficult and steep areas of the trail. Watch your footing carefully because there are some loose rocks at times and as you get closer to the waterfall some wet areas, so it would be easy to slip. 

The first half mile is dusty switchbacks with no shade whatsoever. This was one of the worst parts of the hike. After the switchbacks you’ll hit a flat area for awhile and then you’ll be in the trees. From there most of the remainder of the trail is shady or partially shady. Much of the hike follows the stream so it’s cool and a nice respite from the heat. This is a great summer hike because it’s so shady. 

Along the way you’ll come across multiple areas of cascading water and smaller waterfalls, beautiful green forests, and overall some really great scenery. The final destination, the Adams Canyon Waterfall, is about 40 feet tall and is super spectacular. 

The trail was very busy today with lots of families with kids and lots of people with dogs. Unfortunately we came across evidence of multiple, inconsiderate dog owner’s who didn’t clean-up after their canine friends… So watch your step or you may dirty your boots… yuck.

This hike took us 2 hours and 47 minutes and according to the app Strava, it was 7.6 miles with 2,408 feet in elevation gain. I don't know why these numbers are so much different from the one's reported by AllTrails, but it seemed like a longer hike than the 3.8 miles reported…

We very much enjoyed this hike despite some difficult areas. The scenery was gorgeous, the view of the Great Salt Lake and Davis County was great, and the waterfall at the end was spectacular. Well worth your time. A+"
493,2016-05-29,[''],our first hike of the year. Beautiful and perfect combo of difficulty and easy.
494,2016-05-29,[''],"The lower portion of this trail (taking the right at the first fork) is easy and leads to a beautiful waterfall and pool of water to step in. Did this hike with an infant, 4 year old and a dog :)"
495,2016-05-25,['hiking'],"Let me start by saying this was an absolutely beautiful hike! The views of the valley and the green hills were awesome. The creek is running very fast and you spend quite a lot of time by it which is nice. Now let me say, if you are a desk jockey like me, this will be a tougher trail. There are pretty good elevation gains and toward the top, you are climbing around the rocks. Nothing scary, just will give you a work out. Once you get near the falls, it is fairly steep and you have to cross the creek to see the actual falls. The best hint I saw on here was to take an extra pair of socks, right now you will need them after crossing. There were lots of people who appeared to be in far better shape than me who didn't appear to have much trouble with this. It was a lot of work for me, but the rewards were definitely worth it."
496,2016-05-23,['hiking'],Amazing hike nothing to crazy definitely one of my favorites.
497,2016-05-18,[''],"I hiked this trail with my 12 year old son. We liked it very well. The first half was very easy. It got more difficult as we got closer to the waterfall. In order to see the waterfall at the end we had to wade the creek, but it was well worth it. A spectacular fall!  It started raining and hauling on the way back out - making the rocks very slippery.  All in all a great hike. It took us about 70 minutes to get to the fall and about 45 minutes to hike back out."
498,2016-05-17,['hiking'],It was just awesome!!!
499,2016-05-17,[''],Great trail. A lot of work with kids but well worth the view!  My dog had a blast. Can't wait to do this trail again.
500,2016-05-15,[''],"Great hike, very vertical. The end is worth it!"
501,2016-05-15,['hiking'],"We are definitely out of shape and still able to do this rugged trail. The waterfall is definitely a reward and worth getting wet for !!!

Don't pass up this beautiful walk with an amazing community of people."
502,2016-05-15,['hiking'],"The trail was great! Dog friendly and lots of variety. Heard a lot of good things about the trail, and thought it was time to explore it. It did not disappoint. It was a bit technical towards the top, but worth it. I gave it a four because it was a little to crowded for my taste."
503,2016-05-14,['hiking'],Awesome Trail... Should be called up and down not out and back.:-)
504,2016-05-13,[''],Fantastic!!
505,2016-05-11,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike in the late afternoon and early evening. Water level was high with the spring runoff. Hike is easy to moderate depending on what kind of shape you are in. On our way out there were are a lot of people on the trail, youth groups, scouts, but everyone was very courteous. Definitely worth the time."
506,2016-05-08,['hiking'],"Great hike! I would definitely make sure to bring an extra pair of socks and shoes, as the only way to really see the waterfall is to cross the flow of water. Beautiful scenery. There is a little bit of climbing on rocks to get there, depending on which trail you take, but it was an incredible hike, and I'd definitely go again!"
507,2016-05-08,['hiking'],It is a great fun family hike. We went 2 weeks ago in early spring.  The waterfall was beautiful and full.
508,2016-05-08,[''],Fun trail that is well cared for.
509,2016-05-05,[''],Amazing!!
510,2016-05-05,[''],I liked it a lot and the waterfall was awesome at the end. It took my dog and I an hour and 15 round trip.
511,2016-05-04,['hiking'],Loved all the nature and the friendly people on the trail as well!
512,2016-04-30,[''],Nice little hike. 30 min to the falls.
513,2016-04-28,['hiking'],Good view of pretty much the entire salt lake. You can also head back into the mountain a little bit. Going to check it out again for sure.
514,2016-04-26,['hiking'],great hike
515,2016-04-25,['hiking'],"wow, thought id take the fam (me wife 13 boy 8 boy 6 boy) on quick, short, hike. started late, 530. was going to return by 7 not at 9. the area just kept getting more and more awesome. ended up doing the whole hike. glad we did. waterfall was very cool. well worth it. so proud of boys. youngest had hard time up, but said he wanted to do it again. will do, just start early a.m."
516,2016-04-24,['hiking'],decent short hike for an afternoon.  I'd rate it more to the easy side.  good early hike to stretch the legs.
517,2016-04-22,['hiking'],"It was a great hike. Taking a ""shower"" is really refreshing once you get there."
518,2016-04-19,['camping'],This trail was fun.  we camped over night.  saw the waterfall during the day.
519,2016-04-19,['hiking'],"Favorite hike in northern Utah in the 2-4 hour range. Not to challenging but you should have some good endurance, the worst part is absolutely the first set of switchbacks in sand."
520,2016-04-18,['hiking'],An easy hike in the warm months. Quite tricky before all the snow melts. Very busy on the weekends. Beautiful canyon views the whole way up.
521,2016-04-17,['hiking'],Excellent weather! Very beautiful with very little foot traffic. Completed this hike in ~2 hours roundtrip. Minor snow but didn't pose any obstacles. The waterfall was amazing and the view of the valley at the beginning is incredible!
522,2016-04-17,['hiking'],Beautiful. The beginning is a little rough if you are out of shape like myself 
523,2016-04-12,[''],Beautiful!!! Keep going to the very top! Cross the river on the left side and you can see the most beautiful sites!
524,2016-04-10,[''],"accidently put my review on waterfall canyon, but they are the same. fun hikes, not for little kids!"
525,2016-04-10,['hiking'],Extremely fun hike with great scenery.  Love this trail and will definitely hike it again. Waterfall at the top was well worth it.
526,2016-04-10,[''],This was a fabulous way to spend a Saturday morn with my boy! Absolutely loved seeing all the different breeds of dogs along the way too! All good fun ... and beautiful!
527,2016-04-03,[''],Both lower & upper falls were beautiful. Fun hike.
528,2016-03-28,['hiking'],Excellent hike. We went in late March and there was still snow near the top. It got pretty slick and dicey in some areas but it was a lot of fun. Go all the way to the top! It's worth it.
529,2016-03-28,[''],"Fun, good little hike, but the waterfall isn't that impressive."
530,2016-03-27,[''],Wore running shoes. Not prepared for slick snowy parts. Still worth the bumps and bruises.
531,2016-03-21,[''],"First time doing this trail, I like the trail but there are way to many people on it. Think I will stick with the less traveled trails."
532,2016-03-14,['hiking'],"I've been going up every week for the last month and it's a really a fun hike. There is still some snow on the upper half that running shoes, without extra grip, will be challenged. I used hiking boots and trail poles and it makes it easier. I was able to go up and down in about 2 hrs., but I was pushing it."
533,2016-02-18,['hiking'],The waterfall is gorgeous in the winter but uses your snowshoes or crampons! Otherwise the hike can be exhausting and dangerous.
534,2016-01-10,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful trail, you can go there year round, we have been there in the summer and in the winter and it took us like 2 hours to go up all the way to the fall and about 1.5 hours to come back, we just went back for the second time now in January 2016 and it is beautiful with all the snow, specially the waterfall with all the ice."
535,2015-11-15,['hiking'],Went November 14 2015 and super iced over in some spots. But very fun and cool temp.
536,2015-11-10,['hiking'],Beautiful hike with a few different beautiful waterfalls!
537,2015-09-24,['hiking'],"This was my first time in Utah. I'm only in town for Comic Con this weekend and a local recommended this spot from ""Vapor Affliction"" (Rex). The hike was very enjoyable and the waterfall was a good reward. I had lunch at ""Tosh's Ramen"", (Tonkotsu w/Shiitake mushrooms), then I stopped by ""Tulie Bakery"" (banana tart and slow drip coffee) and ended the night with a Cold Cut Banh Mi from ""No Mai""(as seen on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives)."
538,2015-09-10,[''],"This is one of my favorite hikes. I've done it about 15 times now. The beginning has sandy switchbacks that are a bit tiring but once you get past that and into the trees it's pretty much smooth sailing. The trail is pretty nice and shady from that point on as well. The last stretch of the hike is a bit more of an incline but The waterfall at the end is certainly a reward. You can even climb up the crevice by the waterfall all the way to the top of the mountain if you're up for it, although it's not part of the hike and it's pretty steep."
539,2015-09-09,[''],First trail that I have finished. Just started getting into hiking. Great trail and a great reward at the end loved the water fall!
540,2015-09-07,['hiking'],"It was an enjoyable hike, but the trail is, in my opinion, difficult.  Labor Day is not the best day to hike it.  I am sure there were at least 500 people on the trail.  Most were friendly and understood trail rules.  The falls are nice.  We decided we much prefer consistent trails like Mueller Park, even with all the bike riders.  You won't see any bikes on Adams, but you will see every kind of dog known to man.  Nice way to spend the morning."
541,2015-09-06,['hiking'],Great hike.  Definitely not an easy hike.  I was surprised as we passed 3 families with children younger than 6.  Very dog friendly as well.  People were patient and friendly.  I took my 14 and 10 year old and it was not too challenging for them.
542,2015-08-31,['hiking'],"Fun, quick hike! When we got to the falls we scrambled up the dry rock side and had a great view!!!
We started late afternoon so we could catch sunset on the way out. Excellent trail for running!"
543,2015-08-24,['hiking'],"This is a great hike, and the waterfall at the end is amazing!! This is NOT an easy hike. For about 3/4 of the way it is easy, but the last 1/4 becomes quite steep with several rock scrambles, so be prepared. Also, I think that this is a hike that is best done in the summer/fall. You follow the river very closely at some points and I am sure when there is snow melt the river become quite high."
544,2015-08-20,['hiking'],Great time-- even with 5 little ones in tow-- we all enjoyed it!  The Falls were beautiful!!!
545,2015-08-17,[''],My kids and I really enjoyed this trail.

547,2015-08-10,[''],"Beautiful, rugged, but lots of people."
548,2015-08-08,['bird watching'],"Muddy.  Hard, rocky and uneven terrain in most parts.  The waterfall is pretty, but not the hike.  This trail is NOT EASY."
549,2015-08-07,[''],Nice!!!
550,2015-08-06,['hiking'],"This trail is very dog friendly - there's water almost the whole way - but can be pretty crowded, especially on weekends. I would not call it difficult, more moderate, but the waterfall at the end is definitely worth the trip at least once! I haven't done it in over a year but it's generally one we try to do every summer or fall."
551,2015-08-04,[''],It's tiiiiiight
552,2015-08-02,['hiking'],This was a good hike I recommend early in the morning if you have a dog. The sand is pretty rough on their paws we had to carry our 65 pound dog down the bottom part of the trail because how hot it was in the afternoon!
553,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"It was a great hike! We started the trail at 9 and the sandy part was almost all in the shade. Once you hit the canyon it cools off from the breeze over the water and is almost all in the shade. There are parts that are pretty steep and rocky. It was easier to go up than down! 

It is definitely worth making it to the top! The falls are amazing. The water is super chilly even in August. But it was extremely refreshing after the uphill climb."
554,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"Adam's Canyon is great hike to a beautiful waterfall. It's hard to believe that a trail that starts so close to a busy road can take you to a waterfall deep in a canyon only 1.8 miles later. It involves a little more elevation gain that most of the waterfalls in Utah, but it's totally worth it. Adam's Canyon is a popular hike that only takes a couple of hours to do.

555,2015-08-01,['hiking'],Excellent
556,2015-07-29,['hiking'],"This hike may be a little too difficult for beginners or little kids. the parking lot is small. we're just lucky that we got the last spot available when we arrived.  the entrance of the trail is in a residential area. I almost thought that we were at the wrong place. 

The first half mile or so of the hike is not shaded. So make sure you put a lot of sunscreen before you do this hike. We've seen a couple of snakes on the trail. the first one we was is a small snake on the side of the trail. the second on is a bigger one - probably 4 feet long. so be cautious. once you pass the the hill, most of the parts of will be shaded. it's a little difficult i would say since there are narrow and rocky paths. we stopped halfway to rest and take pictures of course. we saw a fallen log and walked through it to cross the beautiful stream. took beautiful pictures there. after 10 -15 mins, we continued our hike. it was a rocky hike. before hitting the end of the trail, we had to go through a steep rocky trail to get the falls. then we crossed the stream to get to a good resting place close to the falls. be prepared to get your shoes/feet wet. We always bring flip-flops on our hike to soak our tired feet into the water and take pictures of course closer to the falls. Gotta warn you though...the water is ICE cold. 

Overall, it was a beautiful hike. the waterfalls is a great reward after the tiring hike."
557,2015-07-20,[''],Awesome!!
558,2015-07-14,['hiking'],"I completed this trail on a Sunday afternoon with my brother and my dog.  It took about three or so hours round-trip.  The trail is mostly uphill and shaded with a few flat areas to rest or cool down, if needed.  The last part of the hike is more challenging as you will need to climb rocks.  Having shoes with decent traction will be helpful, especially when coming down.  There were mostly twenty-somethings and families, but it didn't feel overly-crowded.  It was dog-friendly and everybody we encountered was friendly and courteous."
559,2015-07-13,[''],Wonderful trail. My dog and kids loved it.
560,2015-07-12,['bird watching'],"My dad and I hiked Adam's Canyon this morning and I would rate this trail as moderately difficult, not easy. The incline of the trail doesn't stop but once in a while you have a few flat areas. Once you reach the canyon it's gorgeous with a nice breeze. We hiked near the stream and climbed up and up. There was one treacherous area where I was afraid of climbing down. Thankfully my dad found us an alternative way to get down by the stream. Whew! We hiked about 3.5 miles or more total and definitely burned some serious calories. Can't wait to do it again and make it to the waterfall!"
561,2015-07-12,[''],Beautiful waterfall! I took my dog and she loved it.  This is a great hike for families.
562,2015-07-10,[''],"It was great! I went a couple weeks ago and I loved it. I made it up the trail in a little less than an hour, but my friend and I were booking it. We went very fast on the way up. It took us about a half an hour to get down. 

Some tips:
-Bring sunscreen. That's a no brainier. 
-If you bring a dog, make sure it's people friendly. There are usually other people on the trail. 
-The very first part of the trail is very hot, and there is sand. I wore white running shoes....I would t recommend doing that because they were brown by the end. But, my running shoes also were very fast drying. That was nice because there is a waterfall at the top that you have to cross some water to get to; my shoes were dry by the time I got done with the entire hike. 
-Going under the waterfall is well worth it if you're hiking in the summer! It cools you down for the entire way down. 
-Bring water and a snack!"
563,2015-07-08,[''],Nice trail with some challenging points.  Love the waterfall
564,2015-07-02,[''],"Not too hard. If you are taking kids, make sure you have plenty of water on hand."
565,2015-07-01,[''],Awesome! Cool canyon hike even in the 100 degree temps.
566,2015-06-27,[''],Great hike. We'll do it again.
567,2015-06-22,['hiking'],"Hiked this Saturday! My dog and I loved it!  BUT- the sand on the first .75 miles is REALLY hot.  Make sure you go early in the day or bring doggy booties (like I did) so your dog doesnt burn their paws!  A little bit of rock scrambling in some parts but a great workout with water for my dog to drink, and the falls were gorgeous.  And the shade was great!  Just need to get past the .75 miles of hot sand and switch backs. 

Great pictures and details on my blog!

568,2015-06-20,[''],"Another great trail in the awesome state of Utah! The 'chairs' up at the top are so cool! I also hiked up to the very top of the ridge, which provided an even more astonishing view of the valley! I found it a little difficult at the beginning, just because there are so many trails, but it wasn't that big of a deal."
569,2015-06-18,['hiking'],"One of my favorite trails,  Don't be scared off by the first part with all the switch backs, because once you get past that, the trail is amazing. Makes for some beautiful water pictures."
570,2015-06-17,['hiking'],"This hike is fantastic! The hike is pretty easy going, until the last 1/4 of a mile or so where you get to climb over rocks. It's not too bad, though! The waterfall is gorgeous!!! Also, this was my first time using this app and I was pleased that it led me straight there!"
571,2015-06-15,['hiking'],It's beautiful!
572,2015-06-13,[''],great hike. my brother and I try to do it once a year.
573,2015-06-09,[''],"Great hike for almost all ages.  There are a few spots near the top where you should watch kids closely, but nothing too major.  Don't let the first section of switchbacks scare you away, because it could be the worst part.  On a hot day this part is pretty uncomfortable.  After that it's a steady climb in the trees with a great pay off at the falls.  Good trail if you haven't hiked in a while and want to get back into it."
574,2015-06-05,['hiking'],"Took my three kids up here on an overcast Friday morning. I heard the worst part was the sandy switchbacks at the beginning, but we made it through that all right. The hardest part for my kids was the last quarter mile, with numerous scrambling and hopping sections. I think an adult with a decent sense of balance would have no problem (although many adults were huffing and puffing, so be prepared for that), but the trail can be quite difficult for small kids due to scrambling and their shorter legs.
That being said, I loved the trail. My first time up here despite having lived in Utah for the past twenty years - I've avoided this one due to the crowds, but hiking it on Friday morning meant it had no more traffic than most other popular trails in the area. It was absolutely gorgeous - not only the waterfall, but the views and sections of the river when the trail got close by. Definitely worth the trip, but I would try to schedule for it an off day so you can enjoy the trip without too many crowds around."
575,2015-06-05,['walking'],First part is a little sandy seems like the trail is washing away but it's beautiful loved it went with husband mother in law and my little chihuahua everyone enjoyed it
576,2015-06-03,['walking'],"This is a difficult trail, but doable. The waterfall is definitely worth the hike. The only thing I wish was different was that the path was clearly marked."
577,2015-05-30,[''],This was a beautiful hike!!! I will definitely do it again!!! The waterfall was amazing! It was a moderate difficulty level but my 6 year old did just fine!
578,2015-05-24,[''],"Not sure I agree with the easy rating all trails has this at, but a great hike none the less. The beginning is pretty steep as you make your way up the switch backs, levels out for awhile and the some climbing up rocks towards the end. Wear quality shoes and take your time and you'll be fine."
579,2015-05-14,['hiking'],"I like hiking in all forms, but to have a nice hike to a great spot , to sit and enjoy and then come back from  is like complete satisfaction to me. 
I took 4 of my kids ranging from 12 down to 4.  All loved it, as did our dog. I have taken many cub scout groups on it as well. You can take it slow and easy, look at snakes, bugs and play in the water along the way, or take off up the rocks if looking for more challenging exercise.
  It is just a perfect hike."
580,2015-04-26,['hiking'],Done this with my husband and our 7 year old. Really great trail!!! My son done excellent on this too.
581,2015-04-06,['hiking'],"This was a fun morning hike. It was SUPER busy when I got there, but everyone was so spread out, it never felt crowded. I got there at 10:30am and there were about 25 cars and when I left, there was at least 50. It took about an hour and twenty minutes to water =fall and 50 minutes to get back down. You have to do a bit of rock climbing at the end, but the waterfall is worth the extra effort. Also watch out for snakes - there was a nice big one in the sandy area at the beginning of the trail."
582,2015-03-24,['hiking'],Such an amazing hike!! My dog loved it.
583,2015-03-21,[''],"This is a difficult hike but well worth it. I took my dog and 2 kids, 10 years old, and we made it all the way up in about 2 hours. The last half is more rock climbing but it's still fun. There were plenty of people on the trail and I saw plenty of little ones too but I don't think my 6 year old daughter would have even made it half way. If you take your time it's a good challenging trail."
584,2015-03-19,[''],"Wow, one of the most beautiful hikes I've done in the northern Wasatch front (lived here less than a year!)
The upper end of the canyon can be chilly as it is deep and shaded. Even on a Tuesday there were around 12 cars at the trailhead - don't expect solitude!"
585,2015-03-14,[''],Great time of year for this hike as it was in the 60s and only enough snow and ice to make it interesting.
586,2015-02-17,['hiking'],Completed this hike in the summer.  Adams Canyon Trail can get crowded so you may want to save this one for a weekday.  The trail can get rocky and at small sections require some easy rock scrambling.  Watch for snakes.
587,2015-02-15,[''],Love this hike.  Did it yesterday and today ....couldn't make it to the waterfall (almost) because I had my 7month old strapped to me in a Carrier and towards the end it was icy and dangerous (with an infant ). But I heard the waterfall was spectacular....was busy...but people are very friendly !
588,2015-02-14,['hiking'],"On a 60 degree day in mid winter we trekked through the mayhem of hundreds if not 1000s of hikers, families and dogs. It was so busy you needed traffic controllers. Apart from poor timing the hike itself was great. A little tougher than the blue rating I thought because of the constant inclines. Better when you break off the main trail for finding the less traveled road :)"
589,2015-02-11,['hiking'],"Awesome Hike!  No snow at all until the very end, and even then there really wasn't much at all."
590,2015-01-29,['hiking'],"I just did this around 11A, and there were 3 others that I ran into within a period of three hours. This was nice, however; the ice for the latter part of the trail was pretty shady. Slipped a few times on the way up and down. Totally worth it to sit alone in the canyon, in the presence of the waterfall and eat some lunch. Little difficult for a beginning hiker, but totally worth it at your own pace. Can't wait to do this one in the summer!"
591,2015-01-04,[''],We hiked this trail on a Sunday morning in January and only saw 1 other person. It is beautiful in the winter. Very peaceful.
592,2014-09-14,['hiking'],"This was an amazing hike. It was a bit difficult on the way up - be careful of the rocks - so I'd suggest an early start and plenty of water. But you weave back/forth across the river before ending up at the waterfall. There are lots of great places to stop and rest if you need to. I saw a lot of people on the trail who didn't make it to the waterfall - some only a few minutes away from it. Such a shame as this is a gorgeous little fall and the water was so refreshing. I saw lots of families too, but I don't know if my kids on all the rocks. Some kids we're having an easier time than others. All in all - a great day hike."
593,2014-08-25,['hiking'],"It was overall a good hike. Harder with little ones, but workable if you have help."
594,2014-08-23,['hiking'],"Decided to take this hike on my last afternoon in town, and was so glad I did. Not as strenuous as some of the others I did recently while in SLC, but the falls and the canyon scenery once clear of the shoreline trail were really very beautiful, especially considering the high amount of traffic on this trail.

There's a nice bouldering/ready free climb opportunity around the falls, and the view from up top is great. Thanks to the nice folks who left a sturdy fixed rope along the cleft that goes to the top of the falls!

Picked up a lot of small trail trash on this route (a full doggie poo bag, really?)...except for the dog bag, not a gripe (little kids need to hike, too!); just be ready to help keep it clean if you're not busy with tots of your own."
595,2014-08-10,['hiking'],"I've hiked dozens of trails in the valley by myself and this is the first one I got genuinely lost on.  There are a myriad of trails to choose from over the decades of usage. The waterfall was lovely, but it was the descent I went astray.  Sure it's lovely but just left a bad taste in my mouth getting lost.  And a Subaru was broken into in the parking lot. Only one car but FYI."
596,2014-08-06,['hiking'],loved this hike!
597,2014-08-03,['hiking'],Very Beautiful hike...Worth the work to get to the waterfall!!!!
598,2014-07-26,['hiking'],"Super great! I TOTALLY recommend it!
It's not a real tough hike, though it does have up hill parts. But if you get tired there are plenty of places that you can stop to take a break. I recommend going in the morning so it's cooler and less crowded and remember to bring lots of water and a camera to take pictures of the BEAUTIFUL waterfall at the end!"
599,2014-07-09,['hiking'],"This is a great canyon to hike.  There are a few difficult parts, but overall it's not too hard if you take your time.  We usually hike it rather quickly with kids and it takes us about 2 hours up and back.  If it's your first time, take your time and enjoy the river, steep canyon walls, and great waterfall at the top.  Bring some snacks and have a little lunch at one of the campsites along the way up."
600,2014-06-15,['hiking'],"A nice trail. We did it on a Sunday, and although it was crowded we had fun. We took our dog off-leash and came across many other dogs along the way. It's definitely a great hike if you have a dog. It runs along a creek for most of the way, and ours loved playing in the water as we hiked. There's a waterfall at the top which was a nice place to stop, relax for a bit, and have a snack. The trail was fairly well-defined for the whole way. There is a small ""trail"" from the base of the waterfall to the top, but unless you're experienced it's quote dangerous, and I wouldn't recommend taking it even if you are, just in case someone takes a tumble and brings you down with them. We saw so many people attempt it who clearly had no idea what they were doing. But anyhow, lovely light afternoon hike. It took us about 3 hours round trip, and we were going at a pretty leisurely pace. "
601,2014-06-11,['hiking'],This has to be my favorite day hike in Utah to date. The hike itself is relatively easy and there are plenty of stops along the way worthy of photographs and lasting memories.
602,2014-06-08,[''],I LOVED this hike. Gorgeous! Following the creek was amazing. Pretty waterfall at the end!
603,2014-05-18,['hiking'],"I hiked this trail on 5/17.  It was extremely crowded, but still an excellent experience.  It was our (me and my daughter, Amy) first time to visit.  If you are going, you really need to stick with it till you get to the big waterfalls.  There is a smaller one about 15-20 minutes from the big one.  Water shoes are OK.  But the water is not deep and you can rock-hop to get to the big waterfall.  I highly recommend it!"
604,2014-05-10,['hiking'],Hiked this with my 2 little girls. I've gone on a Sunday and saw maybe 8 people. This time we went On a Saturday it was super crowded but the WATERFALL was amazing. A little strenuous toward the top for my girls but they did it !!! Bring water shoes you have to go across the river to see the waterfall
605,2014-04-24,[''],"The first time hiking this trail can be confusing in some areas. Thankfully it isn't hard to find your way up if you just track the boot prints of humans and paw prints of dogs. Loved the hike. It had the perfect amount of challenging inclines and obstacles, and a bonus round at the very end - finding a rock path across the river. Or not worrying about it and just trudging through the river. Either way, you're going to get your shoes/feet wet. As always bring water and other outdoor gear you feel necessary for a 2-3 hour excursion."
606,2014-04-05,['hiking'],This was a great hike! Took six kids along with us ranging from four years old to 10 years old. Not too hard but still a fun challenge. Will definitely do it again.
607,2014-02-10,[''],"For all you people Bitching about dogs being off the leash.. if you google ""Layton Utah off the leash dog hike"" Adams canyon trail is the first thing to pop up."
608,2013-11-04,['rock climbing'],"This trail has a few awesome faces to get up. Some great points to anchor in and get a great climb also good free climb spots as well. Right after the small fall that goes over the big boulders is a sweet cliff! Not for amateur climbers! At the waterfall there is some good bouldering and a great place to get your lunch on.  A side note keep your dogs on a leash! No one cares if ""he's the sweetest. oh he'll never bite. He's trained"" its the law. No one wants to be nocked over on the rocks because your dog is bolting along the trail."
609,2013-11-04,['hiking'],His trail was great. I was looking for something new and I ran into this. It was hard but fun. And the waterfall is gorgeous. The parking was pretty easy and it isn't hard to find the area. I enjoyed the scenery and the fact that my dogs could get out for a bit and play in the river. It was all in all a great hiking I'll be doing more often. 
610,2013-10-28,['hiking'],"I went on the hike. It was beautiful. I took my dog, on a leash of course. But lots of inconsiderate people with dogs off leash. I had 4 children with me. They all loved it. Fun hike very pretty."
611,2013-10-15,['hiking'],Solid hike. The last quarter can get pretty hairy  the trail narrows and gets quite rocky  but it's worth it.
612,2013-09-11,['hiking'],This is by far one of my favorite trails.  I hike here several times a week when time permits.  The hike can be difficult based on the route taken.  Some of the obstacles can be avoided by going around them.  That is what I have my small children do when we go together.  It can get crowded especially on weekends and evenings.  The biggest complaint from people I know is the dog owners.  Please be respectful and keep you dog on a leash.  I'm sure your dog is wonderful but dogs fight.  I have seen several altercations on the trail because of unleashed dogs.  The other big complaint is the constant smell of dog poop along the bottom of the trail.  Basic trail etiquette is definitely lacking.
613,2013-09-03,['hiking'],"I enjoyed this hike, but there are a lot of inconsiderate people that have their dogs off their leash.  I brought my boxer, but I had her on a leash and I also brought supplies to clean up after her.  WATCH YOUR STEP to avoid all the doggie doo doo on the trail."
614,2013-08-23,['hiking'],"Fun hike, but lots of people. When you get to the top, there is an area where you can do some bouldering up above the waterfall. The trail follows the river almost the whole way which is nice and refreshing. Be prepared for other hikers that have their dogs with them. Also, the first section of the hike consists of a very sandy trail that switches back multiple times. Once you are past that it is great!"
615,2013-07-24,['hiking'],"It's up up up, followed by down down down, LOL!!!!   I'm from Oregon where we don't have snakes, and I was a little concerned about running into one.  Didn't see any though.  Plenty of friendly people to say 'hello' to on the trail.  "
616,2013-07-09,['hiking'],"Pretty fun hike.. used to try and run it top to bottom, when there aren't so many people.  A few years ago I came down the trail pretty late as the sun was setting, right when all the rattlesnakes came out.. I counted 4-5 before I saw one in the trees right next to a turn in the trail, and he was like, waist high to me.. pretty scary in the trees... About 10 feet in front of me was a little boy, about 6-7 all by him self.  I told the boy to hurry and catch up to his family... which I couldn't even see on the trail..  They were about 400 yards past their kid and had no idea.  I told the mom she needed to keep a look out for snakes, which she sneered ""in Utah? .. we don't have any snakes in Utah""   Attention people who hike in Utah.. snakes are real.  And yes, we have them in Utah."
617,2013-06-15,['hiking'],It's really not that great of a hike. You would be better off going a little more north. Way better hiking up towards Ogden. 
618,2013-06-03,['hiking'],Camped up here on the north side above the canyon on an outcropping of rocks over looking kaysville.  Hiked down and went to the waterfall at about midnight- totally awesome
619,2013-05-25,['hiking'],"First, this is a beautiful hike. Second, this hike sucks due to the sheer overwhelming amount of people on the trail. It gets worse- people with dogs off leash running up and down narrow rocky trails, parents with toddlers taking 10 minutes to get them up a rocky incline, people not following basic trail etiquette, lines of people bottle-necking at inclines. Not to mention mountain bikers on a trail that is set aside for hikers. Id like to give this trail four stars and maybe its a four star trail on a weekday when everyone is at work or in school but on a Saturday or Sunday- forget it; its a waste of time!"
620,2013-05-11,['hiking'],Its a really great hike! I am not a huge fan on really groomed trails but once you get farther on the trail it becomes less groomed. It's got a beautiful over look of the city at night and you can see the Salt Lake and all the way to the Tooele mountains. It was way fun! I recommend it to anyone. The beginning of the trail is a little steep and that is probably why its rated as moderate/harder but once you get down by the river it is stunning. A lot of large fallen trees that crisscross the river. 
621,2013-04-18,['hiking'],"The trail was very enjoyable- fairly steep with not much to look at for the first mile or so, but then it hooks up with a stream with various waterfalls along the way.  I had to stop just shy of 2 miles as the trail was covered with snow/ ice towards the top.  "
622,2013-04-17,['hiking'],"I like Adams Canyon.  I love the falls at the end but I also enjoy the trails that can go beyond the falls.  I wouldn't hike this until all the snow is gone in the mountains as once you pass the bridge there can be some dangerous ice patches.  I am able to do this hike in about 3 hours with my toddler on my back.  The only part I do not like about this trail is the sandy switchbacks in the beginning.  Normally I take the trails on the side of the switchbacks, but I cannot do that safely with my toddler."
623,2013-03-31,['hiking'],"Pretty and quick spring hike at a low elevation with a 1200 ft total gain. Water rushing hard now due to snow melt and it is absolutely stunning. 
Thought that going on Easter would make for some solitude but seems everyone else thought the same thing and the trail was hopping! If you go anyime in the next week or so you will encounter snow and ice in the last quarter mile - bring your micro spikes if you want to make it to the waterfall. 
"
624,2013-03-22,['hiking'],Nice hike close to town so not a lot of driving.  Well worth it at the end is a beautiful waterfall which is refreshing to cool off in on a hot summer hike.  
625,2012-11-05,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! A little challenging towards the top, but well worth it. One of the biggest waterfalls I have seen in utah. 

If you are taking dogs I would recommend starting early (before noon). The trail is sandy for the first half, after the sand sites in the sun it gets extremely hot. We went around 1pm and the sand began to burn the dogs feet. So, either start early, have your dogs wear booties, or if the dogs are small just carry them past the sand."
626,2012-10-07,['hiking'],Lots of fun! Just finished w/ my 8 & 10 year old boys. 
627,2012-09-20,['hiking'],"The trail is supper busy, and fairly technical (climbing over trees, scrambling up dirt hill sides, crossing freezing water)  Don't let this scar you away, if you want to do it you can make it even while caring a kid in a pack.  There is not good place to get fresh water, no bathroom."
628,2012-09-06,['hiking'],"I've done this one three times.  The first time was with some friends.  The second time was with my older son and the third time was with my wife.  Each time was a lot of fun.  The scenery is beautiful once you get up the winding part of the trail.  The waterfall was really cool and a very much needed reward at the end.  I would highly recommend doing this one.  It can get crowded at times, though"
629,2012-08-24,['hiking'],"We hit Adams trail after hiking Waterfall Canyon and we got the blast furnace effect on the initial climb in the sand and it was hot! But once we hit the half way point, if you can call it, and started into the forest, it got a bit cooler but the trail got steeper and rockier. Near the top, the trail seemed to have multiple paths but we followed the one with the most use and came out at the waterfalls and it was worth the trip. Even though the trail was in the Wasatch, I was amazed at how dry it was despite following a stream up to the falls. Came across a couple of wasps gatherings but they did not bother us as we passed through. Great hike and we want to try  it when it is not so hot."
630,2012-08-21,['hiking'],"Most of the elevation gain is at the beginning of the hike, which is sandy with lots of switchbacks. Once you pass the switchbacks you have access to the Bonneville Shoreline trail to the north, or you can continue into the canyon to the waterfall. Definitely do this hike in the AM, or late afternoon since there is minimal shade until you get into the canyon itself. Other hikers were friendly and helpful."
631,2012-08-14,['hiking'],I loved this hike! It was a little tough with some rock climbing. The waterfall at the end was gorgeous! The small waterfall over these enormous holders before you reach the waterfall was pretty! Two thumbs up for this hike! Amazing! Watch out for your children due to some rock climbing on the path. My 10 year old loved it. Just keep your babies and pets close. 
632,2012-08-03,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike! The first half mile is is pretty steep as it is steep uphill climb in the sand. You feel like you're in the desert. It eventually flattens out and there are lots of creeks and trees that helps with the heat. Dogs are allowed on this trail. As long as You follow the water, you will find the waterfall.  There are many trails on this hike that will lead you to a Dead end. I've seen a lot of parents that had to turn around because their kids couldn't make it to the waterfall or couldn't climb the steep hill. The waterfall is spectacular! Definitely have a photo-shoot there!"
633,2012-08-01,['hiking'],"The views of the Salt Lake are gorgeous on this hike! The first half of the hike has little shade and plentiful sunshine, so come prepared. Once trail users get to the trees, the temperature drops significantly. Overall, the trail is beautiful and not too difficult."
634,2012-07-23,['hiking'],My Family did this on April 8th - memorable because my son was born the following day!  I guess I shouldn't have brought my wife all the way up there :-)  It does get a bit rocky and difficult toward the top.
635,2012-06-08,['camping'],"Very nice hike, not that difficult after the first 1/4 mile.  The trail is very busy even late at night. I brought my 4 year old and she had to take a few breaks along the way getting there.  She made it all the way there without being carried.  There are a few steep spots and areas are very rocky.  We camped over night, not great campsites.  There are only a few places to camp and are very, very close to the trail some site even have the trail through the middle. There were people walking through our site till about 10pm.  If you camp just keep an eye on your gear because of all the foot traffic. Otherwise we had a good time. She even ran most of the way back.  "
636,2012-05-18,['hiking'],Beautiful views and really nice people on the trail. The parking lot was completely full and we had to park down the road. 
637,2012-05-14,['hiking'],"I am military and my wife and I just PCS'd here in November. This was our second hike here (we did birdsong, as a warm-up). I loved it... the perfect mix of challenge and reward. I like how the trail travels through the forest and is relaxing and shady (at times), other times it feels like your going straght up. We had a really great time. My only regret is we didn't bring a camara. "
638,2012-05-05,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes. Lots of greenery, instead of rocks like up waterfall canyon. I go up several times a year. The views are gorgeous. Great hike! Very shaded. Pretty waterfall up top. About a 4 hour hike, maximum."
639,2012-04-21,['hiking'],"I took my six year old son on this hike twice now. Yesterday I went at his pace completely.  We made it up to the falls in 36 minutes.  We made it back to the trailhead in 29 minutes.  This trail does have a few rocky places and places where falling is possible, but what hike doesn't.  Children can do this hike if they are under cautious supervision.  The trail is, in my opinion, of moderate difficulty.  However, i am in good physical condition."
640,2012-04-15,['hiking'],Beautiful hike and waterfall. well worth it.
641,2012-03-29,['hiking'],"I have hiked Adams Canyon several times and have enjoyed the hike each time. This time of year the canyon was not full of hikers as usual. The start of the trail is a bit strenuous, but as you get to the top of the switchbacks it eases into a nice climb up to the water fall.  Once you start into the canyon the trail is shaded as you hike along the creek. There a  couple of places where you navigate around some rock outcroppings but it is still a nice hike. Good family hike."
642,2011-09-05,['hiking'],This was our first time for Adams Canyon and it was awesome. We did it with our 9 and 6 year old and they did great until we were almost back. The last section before the falls is very steep and requires extreme care but it is definitely worth it.
643,2011-08-28,['hiking'],Fun little trail.  We had a great time.  Nice waterfall at the end.
644,2011-08-12,['hiking'],We had a great time hiking to this falls in this canyon. We were fortunate to meet some folks coming down the trail that told us to keep going and to step out into the stream to get the full effect of the falls. It was a very pleasant hike.
645,2011-08-01,['hiking'],"With the exception of the sandy switchbacks at the very beginning of the trail, this trail is absolutely awesome!  It's long enough that you really feel like you got a good workout but very easily done in an afternoon.  It has a very nice combination of easy, moderate and difficult.  There is a lot of shade.  You don't have to do the entire hike in order to get the great scenery.  The waterfall at the top has a pool at the bottom of the fall about 12 inches deep-deep enough to take a very refreshing dip at the end of the long, tiresome hike.  If you plan on doing the entire hike, I wouldn't recommend this for parents with kids under the age of 10.  Perfect ""date hike."""
646,2011-07-30,['hiking'],"Nice trail sometimes too busy, instead of going in the canyon there are some awesome destinations on the North and South Rims of the Canyon.  Cabins that are open to a nights stay.  Good luck, finding them is half the battle if you have never been there.  Good family hike and do watch out for rattlers, usually not a problem at all either."
647,2011-07-21,['hiking'],"I did this once this morning, and again in the afternoon, great trail, but like others have said, the switchbacks are rough, mostly because of the loose sand/silt/dirt on that part of the trail.  After that the rough parts are what you would expect from a canyon hike next to a creek, rocks, water edging and crossing, but well worth it once you hit the top and get to the falls, which are a great place to re-stretch and take a breath before heading down again."
648,2011-07-19,['hiking'],Great trail...make sure u either go first thing in the morning or evening. Can be very hot...no cover cover for shade in first portion of the trail.
649,2011-07-10,['hiking'],I love this trail and do it all the time with my boyfriend and his family. The water fall at the end is beautiful and the hike up there isnt too bad either. 
650,2011-06-17,['hiking'],In the short time I have been here in Kaysville I have done Adams Canyon three times.  It's a must do trail.  Good workout getting up the initial switchbacks at the beginning of the trail...but so rewarding when you hit the wooded area and start your assent up the canyon along the creek.  You then get a second workout after you cross the creek and have to literally climb rocks to the waterfall.  I think the best part is having to walk through the creek at the end to see the upper 40' waterfall.  Don't miss the lower waterfall which is off to the south at the top of the switchbacks.  There is a trail located between the BST (Bonneville Shoreline Trail) and the switchbacks that takes you south down to the creek.  There is another hidden 15' - 20' waterfall that is just as beautiful as the upper fall.  After the lower fall you have to take the trail back up to the switchbacks and then back to the trail head as the trail down from the lower falls dumps you into the housing track below.
651,2011-05-04,['hiking'],"First hike out of the bag for a few years, switch backs up from parking lot certainly get you going. Take a right fork to the first waterfall, definitely worth a visit. Then back on the main trail, over a small wooden bridge to the second waterfall at the end of the Canyon. The last hundred meters is harder going and there was still some snow on the ground, which made conditions a little trecherous. But the final waterfall is well worth the climb."
652,2011-04-21,['hiking'],It is nice that is it so close by. Still a little bit of a workout to get there.
653,2010-06-08,['hiking'],Really nice scenic hike. Follows a creek almost the whole way up to a really cool waterfall. Though parts of trail can be a bit steep and demanding overall it's a relatively easy hike.
