0,2019-08-02,['off road driving'],Fun easy trail for a quick evening ride
1,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"We went up yesterday (July 20th, 2019), the gate was open to go all the way to the top! What an amazing ride with beyond amazing views! "
2,2019-07-11,['off road driving'],"Drove today (7/10/19). It's gated at the pass parking area above Willard Basin, roughly a few miles from the end. Sign says it will be open on the 15th. Still a great drive with awesome views. Relatively easy but it's still a really fun 4WD road. It has a good variety of soft sand, rocks, ruts, berms, banked switchbacks, etc. Most stock 4x4s should be fine (in dry conditions), especially if driven by someone with good skills."
3,2019-06-27,['off road driving'],What amazing trail I mean beautiful sites everywhere. We almost made it to the top but we got stopped by solid pieces of snow blocking the road. Still great drive.
4,2019-05-27,"['off road driving', 'muddy']","this is a fun little trail. There are a lot of good places to pull off and explore. Most of the trail is pretty narrow though. At places the trail passes through private property so it's necessary that you keep aware of trespass markers. 

It was muddy and snow pack kept us from getting to the end of the trail. I suggest the side trails heading down Devil's Gate County Rd. "
5,2019-04-19,['off road driving'],This is a great ride.  The name says it all.  A lot of people will come here for a chance to check out the gates that live in this area.  Others like the fact you can hit two peaks in one day.  Both Willard and Ben Lomond are a easy hike from here.  Just logging my time up here.  I didn't drive up here in April
6,2018-12-01,['off road driving'],Old Jeep Grand Cherokee loved this rocky dirt road. Slow going in some spots. Views would have been even better if not for the smoke from the wildfires that had drifted into the area.
7,2018-11-22,['off road driving'],This is an easy trip in a 4WD truck.  It is rocky and a higher clearance vehicle with appropriate tires will make the trip a breeze.  Views are awesome.
8,2018-10-29,['off road driving'],"This is a fabulous drive that any 4wd can handle.  It’s narrow and rocky, but nothing technical.  The views are beautiful on both sides of the Wasatch range.  I was impressed by how many campgrounds are spread around near the trail.  I can’t wait to come back for some summer camping."
9,2018-10-15,['off road driving'],"This was a really fun trail. I took my Wrangler up recently and enjoyed the varied types of trail, from rutted dirt, high-banked corners, to super rocky roads, it was a little bit of everything. Definitely not for a non-4x4, but it wasn't difficult, it was just really fun. The Jeep loved it and handled it like a dream, as I imagine most competent off-road capable cars would. The view up top was pretty amazing. I would definitely recommend this trail."
10,2018-09-24,['off road driving'],"I took a stock 1996 Ford Explorer with decent A/T tires up there, the fall shift is just starting, and you're completely surrounded by greens, oranges, yellows, & reds the entire way up, patience is important and sometimes you're choosing lines through some fairly rocky terrain, but if you have functioning 4x4 and a day to spend away from the city, this trail is an awesome choice."
11,2018-08-19,['off road driving'],Amazing drive.. very rocky but a stock SUV can make it. Air down your tires.. Lots of OHV traffic. The views can’t be beat.
12,2018-08-09,['off road driving'],"Great trail. Beautiful views all around. 4x4s will be fine, but I'd recommend something smaller to accommodate the absurd amount of minivans on the trail. Really folks -- been up there twice and had several very tenuous moments working around a minivan. I have nothing against minivans (had a Honda Odyssey for which I almost got a neck tat commemorating its ownership) - but on this trail, they are endangering themselves and others."
13,2018-05-05,['off road driving'],fun drive. The top is beautiful.
14,2017-06-04,['hiking'],"I did not four wheel or other vehicle. Drove up as far as I could in a small car. Parked and walked up to short of the 8500 ft level when snow blocked even my way (I did not have crampons so I would not slid downhill), so I turned around. Trail was mostly easy. Trail dust from sidebys, 4 wheelers and motorcycles was pretty bad on the way down (later in the day). Would like to finish the hike as it appears I was .6 miles short of the point. Oh well, later in the summer."
15,2017-04-23,['off road driving'],Ive came up here plenty of times and the view has always been incredible the trail to get up here is blocked by the snow sometimes but if you can make it up here it is worth it
16,2016-11-06,[''],"did it today.  there was plenty of traffic, but was worth the rocky sometimes snowy sections
4wd for sure
beautiful vistas"
17,2016-09-04,['off road driving'],"Road is in good condition for the most part. Very rocky, but any stock 4wd could do it no problem. Beautiful scenery, and the view from Inspiration point is awesome."
18,2016-07-29,['off road driving'],"From May 31st to Sept 1st. And All of October expect lots of traffic on this road.
Most of the way up its wide enough for a full size truck and a 4 wheeler . When another full size truck is coming towards you , one of you need to back up to a wider spot in the road .. It's a ""WHITE KNUCKLE "" deal.. 
The road is in great condition until about 1 mile past the Avon fork then it's very rocky .. Be careful 
A 2 wheel drive could make it but this is a 4 WD road .. 
Once you catch some elevation the views are stunning .. Well worth the drive .. Once on top you will come to the Willard Basin Sign . ( it's a big sign on the right) . 
Now your descending into Willard basin in 2 miles you'll come to a spring ( black poly pipe with running water on south side of road ) stop and have a drink "" Fresh & Pure"" on your right there are camp grounds with Fire Pits and Picnic Tables ..
Also this is where you should park your car, truck , SUV , 4 wheeler ect.. 
The trail head to hike to Willard Peak and then onto Ben Lomond is on your left .. There are 4 or 5 trails you want the one that goes around the east side of the pond .. Just start hiking your best guess and when you see the pond change over to the correct one , or keep hiking the one your on .. All of them lead to the same place .. The hike to Ben Lomond from here is 3 miles so 6 miles ( round Trip ) 
Watch out for Rattle Snakes this is a bad year for them ( note : it is against the law to kill a rattlesnake in Utah) so f you encounter one just stand way back and give it some room in a few minutes it will move away and you can continue your hike ..
Wild flowers every where ..
If you decide to continue to Inspiration Point it's 2 miles further ..once on top of the world "" great at night watching the sunset ""
There's a nice Bench on one end .. Enjoy and have fun .. Happy Trails"
19,2016-06-29,['off road driving'],"As of June 28, 2016 they had the road closed to motor vehicles about 5 miles before Inspiration Point (due to some fallen trees across the road).

If you decide to walk the rest of the way, keep an eye out for the trail that forks off to the left toward Willard Peak, it is a *much* shorter walk, especially to the peaks, than following the actual road to Inspiration Point."
20,2016-05-11,[''],I couldn't make it to inspiration point but I made it to Avon in Liberty
21,2015-10-11,['off road driving'],Traffic was a bit more than we like but a good morning ride.
22,2015-09-25,['bird watching'],"What a great way to take my jeep out for a little ride! It was a lot longer then I remembered in the past, but still a great ride! Not recommended for cars or trucks with low ground clearance. Has some rock spots at times, ground clearance with beefer tires highly recommended."
23,2015-08-21,[''],I had so much fun on this drive. Lots of scenery and not a lot of people. Nice to just get away with my jeep!
24,2014-12-26,['hiking'],What a awesome area.  Took the ride to Inspiration Point and hike Willard Peak and continued on to Ben Lomond.  I saw a lot of great country today.  Well worth the ride up.
25,2013-06-04,['off road driving'],"Great Sunday drive.  Takes some time, and must be done in late Summer/early fall.  The wildflowers were beautiful and the view at the top is absolutely breathtaking. Truly called Inspiration Point for good reason."
26,2011-07-12,['off road driving'],Road is in good shape even with the run off.  Ran into snow drifts about 4 miles in and had to turn back.
