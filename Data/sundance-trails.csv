2,2015-10-08,['mountain biking'],Sundance Resort offers amazing trails and majestic views. Ride the ski lift to the top and enjoy an easy ride down. The staff was super helpful and pointed out their favorite trails to try. I will go back for sure!

It's a beautiful trail with great views. Not incredibly difficult, but not for anyone afraid of heights! Saw a deer right next to the trail."
4,2015-06-27,[''],Gorgeous good trails but be prepared to pay.
5,2015-06-23,[''],We had a great time.
6,2013-05-31,['mountain biking'],Great mountain biking trails. Primarily downhill if you ride the lift (reasonably priced). Beautiful scenery with moderate to technical downhill trails. There are enough trails and they are long enough to keep you busy for several hours. I highly recommend mountain biking here.
7,2013-05-31,['mountain biking'],The resort is mainly for downhill. There are plenty of options to choose from. For the more XC minded I would definitely recommend doing Archie's Loop. It had some awesome views of the canyon and wasn't too difficult.
