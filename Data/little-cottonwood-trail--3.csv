1,2019-08-06,['mountain biking'],"I road this trail mountain biking. It's an awesome trail. In my opinion, this is an upper intermediate/advanced trail mountain biking. It definitely has some a couple steep and rugged technical climbs/drops. Awesome trail. Stays close to to the river which makes for an absolutely beautiful trail. "
2,2019-08-05,['hiking'],little mini hike with my mini

4,2019-07-22,[''],Great trail with great views.
5,2019-06-26,['hiking'],Lots of streams and trails for mountain bikers... pretty wide road... basically down hill and all up hill to leave... not bad when your stopping at the streams with a little one ..   shady areas. Very pretty! 
6,2019-06-24,['hiking'],"Did this trail on 6.23.19. Plenty of shade throughout, not very crowded. River was rushing, a couple of muddy spots but nothing too bad. Great views throughout. Would definitely do this hike again. We crossed the road at the end to hike Lisa Falls and that was very crowded in comparison. "
7,2019-06-23,['hiking'],"Hiked this yesterday. Like others, I also recommend finishing with crossing the street (carefully- the cars are flying!) to Lisa Falls. Lisa Falls is very pretty and a great picnic spot before turning around. Once you cross street and find trail head, you still have to hike another 5 minutes or so to get to the falls coming down the rocks. I heard from fellow hikers that these falls will probably dry up with the season change, so try to get there soon! Overall, beautiful trail with lots of trees, gorgeous water, boulders and maybe even a campsite or two (not sure rules on that)!"
8,2019-06-21,['hiking'],I would definitely consider it on the easy side of “moderate.”  Visited on a weekday and it wasn’t crowded.  Lots of shade and beautiful views.  Trail is wide enough to not worry about getting run over by bikers. Some rocky parts here and there but nothing challenging by any means.  I will definitely be returning again!
9,2019-06-20,['hiking'],Hike Lisa Falls across the roadway first and finish with this trail! The River is roaring and absolutely breathtaking. We are from out of town and found this to be an easy hike. Will definitely do this again in the future!
10,2019-06-11,['hiking'],Lots of water in the river. No snow. Dry trail. Warm weather.
11,2019-06-10,['mountain biking'],"Rocky, but not a deal breaker, just annoying. "
12,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Lots of bikes but paths are pretty wide.  Beautiful now with the river flowing so strong.  I’ll go again!
13,2019-06-06,[''],"One of my favorite trails but go during the week otherwise it gets crowded with hikers, bikers and runners. It's mostly shaded and at some points right now the stream runs through the trail but it's not crazy muddy. Happy hiking "
14,2019-06-04,['hiking'],"The last time I went up this trail was 2018 at the end of the summer. I would definitely rate this one on the higher side of moderate, only for the fact that the incline was rough. My friend and I only saw one other person on the trail. It was afternoon when we went. Nice hike to a beautiful view! So recommend!!"

17,2018-12-12,[''],December 11th...snow packed trail. Fun hike and super peaceful with all the snow. Didn’t even use my snowtrax.
18,2018-09-17,[''],it's good with great info
19,2018-08-07,['hiking'],"LOTS OF BIKES! Just be alert but that was even on a Tuesday evening at 5:30. The first part of the trail is lame bc it’s a sand and gravel road and the water was under in the canal so no creek to cool you off. Hike does get better after you get past the hydro plant - look for the trail signs (small, wood, slightly faded) to figure out where to go."
20,2018-06-25,[''],My only complaint is it’s barely wide enough for hikers and cyclists.
21,2018-05-12,['hiking'],"My husband and I completed this hike on May 5, 2018.  We had a difficult time finding the trailhead using the ""directions"" feature of AllTrails. Not sure if it was the fault of AllTrails or GoogleMaps, but we definitely got turned around a few times.

Once we got going, though, it was a lovely, scenic trail.  It takes you along the river for the majority of the hike, so there's multiple spots to stop and enjoy the sights and sounds of the rushing river. The trail is shaded more than half the time. There are also great views of the granite walls of the mountain.  It was this granite that was used to help build the SLC Temple. The trail is slightly uphill the whole way, with a few instances of a more moderate incline. 


The only drawback is that the trail is always within a few hundred feet of the canyon road, so you can hear car noise on occasion. 

Overall a lovely hike!"
22,2018-02-18,[''],"Surprisingly delightful along the stream. Did this in early spring to take the long way to Lisa Falls. There’s some historic structures along the route, some have unfortunately been graffitied and trashed"
23,2017-07-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, so much to see!  One of my favorites.  Starts in the Temple Quarry parking lot. I'd recommend walking the super short Temple Quarry trail first, lots of interesting information!

I hiked this trail on a Sunday afternoon in July and hardly encountered anyone.  There were a handful of bikers and a few hikers and campers, but otherwise it was very peaceful. It was a very steady incline the whole way out; if you want a shorter hike, I'd recommend parking along the road further up from the Temple Quarry lot and dropping in to the Little Cottonwood trail from there.

Note: Many reviews listed under the Temple Quarry trail include the Little Cottonwood trail also."
24,2017-07-04,[''],"Nice easy walk along the creek,  very nice during the run off.  Watch out for the bikes"
25,2016-04-02,['hiking'],Hiked the upper end in addition to Lisa Falls. Nice easy hike along Little Cottonwood Creek
26,2016-04-02,['hiking'],Nice wide trail along the river
