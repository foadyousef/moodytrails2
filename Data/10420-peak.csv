1,2019-06-28,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","Love this hike.  Still snow half way up - yak traks and poles helped but in the sun areas were very slippery.  THere was one section of butt sliding - glad it was only a few feet!  At the top, all the rocks were exposed and covered in ladybugs!  Awesome hike, continued down to Blood Lake which still had some ice - beautiful hike - one of my favorites.  "
2,2019-06-25,['hiking'],totally wanted to puke climbing this today! If it wasn't worth the views I don't know if I would do it again. it is extremely hard right now with all of the slush and snow melt. I would recommend bringing trek poles. but seriously one of the prettiest hikes I've been on this year. Do it!! 
3,2019-06-07,['hiking'],Love this hike! The view at the top is amazing. Highly recommended. Definitely a challenge at the start but it levels out a bit and then you are rewarded with an awesome view. 
4,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"This hike was all uphill on rocky terrain. I went with my two kids on a Saturday in August. My seven-year-old enjoyed the challenge, but my four year old had a hard time with how steep it was. The views at the top were stunning!!! We decided to come down using the trail going around the side of the mountain that meets up with Blood Lake trail. That was a much easier trail (less slope) and the lake was beautiful, but packed with people and dogs. I would definitely do that loop again!"
5,2018-07-21,['hiking'],Don’t let the description fool you - this mile long hike is very steep. I saw a few people give up before making all the way up. I took my 5 yo and she was a champ. Don’t let the challenge avert you. It is very doable and the payoff is fantastic!
6,2018-07-02,['hiking'],I wouldn’t call this ‘easy’ if starting from the parking lot at the pass. The initial climb is pretty steep and rocky but the views at the top are beautiful. A hiking stick will be your best friend.
