0,2019-08-31,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']","It was definitely fun! Mountain bikes, joggers, hikers and dog friendly. Has some shade in the beginning then the sun beats on you. Recommend doing this early in the morning not when it’s hot. Still was beautiful."
1,2019-08-19,['hiking'],"The trail starts out nice, but there is some shade. If you walk on the black top you have to watch for vehicles. It’s disappointing that you can’t take your dog past the 2.6 mile mark. It’s also hard on dogs because of the distance of the round trip. There’s two spots with lots of bees. They were really thick. There are dirt trails you can go on but these are hard for some dogs.  Right now there is no potable water at site 15 & 16 those are toward the 2.5 mile marker.  It’s a nice trail for a walk or bike ride. Not really for a hike. "
2,2019-08-13,['hiking'],"Nice, easier trail. Part shade and part sunny. A little overgrown at some parts. More of a casual walk and/or running type trail than a hike. "
3,2019-07-28,['trail running'],This is a fantastic trail if you like scenic runs with wide smooth paths. Entirely paved but still feels naturey. 2 way traffic. Lots of restroom stops. Pretty strenuous consistent climb for running on the way out. About 50/50 shaded. We went on a Thursday morning; I would say it had light to moderate traffic. Mostly bikes but no one coming in too hot. 
4,2019-07-20,['hiking'],Pretty boring trail. Felt like more of a walk than a hike.
5,2019-07-05,['hiking'],nice trail go to exit 11 you will love it
6,2019-06-16,['hiking'],About as nice as you can get for walking up a road. Great option when you just want a stroll in a nice setting.
7,2019-06-02,['hiking'],"Easy ‘walk’ in a lush green canyon. Not a hike by any means as the road is always in view and power lines are right on/near the trail. However, it was a perfect little trek to keep active following ab surgery a few weeks ago."
8,2019-05-27,['road biking'],Great cardio workout 
9,2019-05-18,['hiking'],
10,2019-05-11,['hiking'],The wonderful sound of rushing water.  Creek was up and running fast.  Great casual walk.  Several picnic tables with BBQ pits along road (it is a paved walkway and biking road). 
11,2019-04-08,['hiking'],Great hike this close to a major city.  Only minor points were hiking parallel to a road and telephone poles in a few sections.  It would be great if there were options to loop into the other hilltop trails.
12,2018-09-27,['hiking'],"First of all, this is a walk not a hike. Second of all, if I could give a trail negative stars, this would be the one.

The road that leads to it has two lanes separated by a double yellow line legally indicating two way traffic and there is no signage near the trailhead indicating otherwise. But the road is used as a ONE WAY. It’s a total death trap for drivers, walkers, bikers..."
13,2018-09-08,['trail running'],Pretty views of the canyon. Decent amount of other people on the trail on a Saturday morning. Walked about 3 miles up and ran the way out. Good trail if you want something nice and easy to get used to trail running on.
14,2018-08-16,['walking'],"We ended up picking a really hot day to do this one and it was a little miserable at parts; I'd like to come back on a cooler day, probably it'd get a better rating after that. Looking at other reviews, I guess we didn't make it past the first stage of the hike, but we were looking for something wheelchair accessible so we might not have been able to enjoy the nicer parts anyway. We did see some wildlife--birds and butterflies, mostly. Pretty high traffic, there were even cars driving on the trail."
15,2018-08-12,[''],"Very good trail quality, but lots and lots of bees. Very little shade."
16,2018-08-01,[''],good intense walk
17,2018-07-25,[''],This isn’t really a “hike” per say..but more of a nature walk. It is really pretty and you can venture off the paved path onto several other small dirt trails. We came across a bobcat and quite a few wild turkeys which was really cool. There’s not shade everywhere so it’s best to walk this earlier in the day.
18,2018-07-20,[''],Nice paved hike. Inclined at some areas but not bad
19,2018-07-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful! You can use the paved road that goes into the park. There are shaded areas, especially as it starts out. However there were a lot of mosquitoes, gathered around along the creek and anywhere there was standing water. Sometimes they were in swarms and relentless. The bikers could easily zoom through, but, as I was on foot, I ran through them! I did not have mosquito repellent on, so next time, I will be sure to use some! Otherwise very pretty area and views of the canyon."
20,2018-06-19,[''],City Creek is perfect for a progression workout if you’re a runner. The 3 miles of 600ft gain is manageable enough to run the entire way out. And you’re rewarded with a fun 3 miles back screaming down the canyon! Paved and very nicely shaded 
21,2018-06-06,[''],it was fun and easy. not far from the city but far enough to get peace.
22,2018-06-01,['walking'],"Simple, clear path with lots of trees. Running beside the creek, it's a pleasant walk with children. Parking is difficult. It's a lovely little getaway for an evening. Dogs were off-leash everywhere, one even jumped on our two-year-old, he didn't like that, but generally friendly. A beautiful easy hike for the family."
23,2018-05-23,['hiking'],"Very easy trail, with parking right by the trailhead."
24,2018-05-17,['hiking'],Easy trails with beautiful scenery!
25,2018-05-07,[''],Great little hike to get outdoors for a bit
26,2018-05-06,[''],it's just a nice hike. hike this trail with my uncle 2 to 3 times a year
27,2018-02-04,['hiking'],lots of great trails to follow
28,2018-01-20,['hiking'],I have been hiking here for 3 years now. It's pretty easy to get to from the intersection of 11th Ave and B street. The hike is basically of 2 portions. The first one is a little over 3 miles and ends at the water treatment plant. The road is wide and the trek is not very steep at all. The second portion is about 2.5 miles and it starts at the water treatment plant. It's covered in snow during winter. The road is narrower and some steep drop offs on the right while going up. Some portions are a little steep but very manageable. The third portion of this hike is a dirt road which starts when you reach the end of the 5.5 mile hike.There are signs to be aware of cougars and bears. I have done this only once and I must say it's a little spooky. The stream runs right next to the dirt road and there is hardly anyone on this road. I must have walked about 3 miles and turned back but you can go further.
29,2018-01-06,['hiking'],"So great to have a paved trail into a pretty canyon in the winter!  We walked up past mile marker 2 and really enjoyed the icy creek and beautiful mountains—and the quiet so close to downtown!  The kids (15, 11, 9, and 7) all said they want to come back and do this hike again during other seasons."
30,2017-11-27,['road biking'],great climb with easy access from downtown
31,2017-10-14,[''],"Beautiful scenery,  but can be a narrow path so careful with your kiddos."
32,2017-10-02,['hiking'],"Great trail, a few miles uphill & then connects to the BST where you can hike on for a few miles at relatively level elevation."
33,2017-09-01,['hiking'],Trail is closed right now because of wildfires
34,2017-08-25,[''],You can see  wild life if you pay attention. fun place and lots of shade.
35,2017-07-05,['hiking'],This was a very beautiful train almost the entire way. We were only able to do 4.5 miles. I recommend this to everyone.
36,2017-07-03,[''],"I've done the hike from the gate to the top a bunch of times. It's so close and convenient to the city. 
It can be done all on the road. I prefer to take the trail on the left at about the first picnic spot. It continues to just short of the water treatment plant and then you have to take the road the rest of the way.  Lots of shade with a few exposed stretches. 
When I did it today (7/4) there was no water above the 12th picnic spot so fill up and take plenty. 
There is lots of wildlife all up and down the canyon. Today I saw a turkey and a garter snake and a world of butterflies. I've seen coyotes, deer ,elk lots or birds, a bobcat and much more. 
I'm 71 and can do the round trip in 31/2 hrs hiking time and just under 4hr total. . If I can do it you can too. I think you'll really enjoy it."
37,2017-06-27,['trail running'],"Nice spot for a variety of sports, very accessible. I run here occasionally."
38,2017-06-22,['walking'],So fun! It was perfect for my kids since the road is very gradual and more than half shaded in the morning. There are restrooms at the base of the canyon and also a little parking lot if you go up the road a little bit. It was great to hear the creek while you hike and we saw so many butterflies! There are picnic tables all the way up you can sit and rest at. We made it to #7 before we had to come back because of time constraints.
39,2017-06-12,['trail running'],First time trail running in a couple years. The way up is a nice steady incline with plenty of flat spots on the way up. Lots of tree cover too! At 3 miles the trail runs out and merges onto a road. I took the road another mile and a half and then turned around. I hit the trail at around 4pm and hardly saw anyone else on the way up. I ran into a coyote on the trail and watched him for a bit. Saw two deer and a bunch of squirrels.
40,2017-06-12,['walking'],Pretty view of downtown at the beginning once you're at the top and pretty easy once you make it up the first steep hill.
41,2017-06-11,['hiking'],
42,2017-06-07,['trail running'],Fantastic!
43,2017-05-28,[''],we actually went up another 2 miles..7.7 it was great discovered a section on the river where the water comes outta some cave looking ...Great scenery after you pass the end of the road pass tbe gate...at the end of the hike we did 15.4 and it was great..
44,2017-05-28,['trail running'],I loved this!! I only went up 3 miles but it is gorgeous!!
45,2017-05-14,[''],Nice paved path to walk on. Easy hike. Nice and shaded most of the way.
46,2017-05-01,['hiking'],We hiked the trail to the right of the river for 30 minutes then turned around. I had a 5 &2 year old and 7 month old in a sling. Watch for down hill bikers.
47,2017-03-21,[''],we killed there and back in 4 hours.the last 1.3 miles we hiked in 1.5 feet of snow and during that we saw big cat tracks and towards the end was bear tracks..No one had been that far up since last snow storm..it was really nice for sure..
48,2017-01-30,[''],Great place to go for a run! Good for all skill levels and very scenic.
49,2017-01-07,['snowshoeing'],This is a clean hike and could be hiked in just shoes or boots.
50,2016-09-05,['trail running'],"To clarify the description, there are two parallel paths here: The paved road, which is open to cars on even days, bikes on odd days, but always to pedestrians, (and is heavily used - If you walk/hike/run on the road, make sure you stay creekside (like all the huge signs tell you)), and the trail, which is just uphill to the NW.  The trail still sees a lot of traffic, but not as much as the road.  There are several places to access the trail - just look for any trail going uphill away from the creek and it should take you there.  Dogs aren't allowed past the water treatment plan, roughly where the trail ends.  Cycling is very nice all the way up 6 miles to Rotary Park.  The nicest thing about the trail is that it gets more shade then most of the other trails in the area.  The road is nice in that it puts you right next to the creek."
51,2016-09-04,['hiking'],Paved road.   Didn't see any indication of where the trail ends.
52,2016-07-25,['hiking'],Did this a few years ago.  Great for all ages
53,2016-06-13,['walking'],Nice and easy walk on paved road up City Creek trail with dog on leash. Great for strollers and bikes. Would do it again if looking for a short and easy hike.
54,2016-06-09,['hiking'],"Easy, paved trail along a beautiful creek. You can take the trail as far as you'd like; I only reached the 3.5 mile marker (after walking past some not-so-pretty government buildings), but the maps show the trail continuing for miles past that. Lots of picnic benches and pit toilets. I hiked around 7 am and it was nice and cool. 
As I was leaving, an officer arrived and put out a sign stating that bikers were not allowed through August, if I remember correctly. However, before the officer arrived, there were a few bikers on the trail.
If you're nervous about wildlife, there were signs posted warning about recent black bear and cougar sightings."
55,2016-06-06,[''],it was awesome if you're in shape.  I brought some of my friends along and they struggled a bit
56,2016-05-31,['mountain biking'],"Probably my favorite trail to mountain bike; its paved, well maintained, and moderately trafficked, excellent for beginners, plenty of places to stop and rest and follows along the creek."
57,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"My dog loves the water so we hike around this area all the time. Nice and shady and pleasant, but pretty heavy traffic."
58,2016-05-21,['trail running'],"I actually jog on the road most of the time so I don't have to think about where my feet are.  I love running out here.  it's a climb, but managable (and I am no world class athlete by any stretch of the imagination).  During the warmer months, there is a water fountain about every 1/2 mile as well as pit toilets, which is awesome during long jogs or in the summer.  There are usually people at the start of the jog, but often after a mile - I don't see anyone else or just a bike or two.  Love it!"
59,2016-05-20,[''],"This is a nice, fun hike. I loved the view from the top. I usually hike on the east side so it's fun to look at the valley from the north! It's very beautiful and green up there right now! 

P.s. This trail is a heavy mountain biking trail so be sure to be aware of bikers coming up or down."
60,2016-05-19,[''],Love taking my dogs here but it's nothing to brag about
61,2016-05-18,['hiking'],I grew up in the little yellow house that used to be right inside the gate at city creek. This is my favorite place to take my son for a walk/hike!
62,2016-05-15,[''],Fun hike with my family. We took the west trail to the overlook of the Capitol building and watched the sunset. Gorgeous!
63,2016-04-19,['trail running'],Great scenery. Trail is maintained and has adequate facilities and picnic areas. Plan on running this often!
64,2016-03-22,[''],"This is the most easiest trail to do ,"
65,2016-03-20,[''],Many different trails some were fairly difficult but very nice day.
66,2016-03-13,[''],so nice and so many trails
67,2015-08-05,[''],"Nice to be able to run traffic free and pick up some elevation gain. Usually go to the top and back making it close to 12+ miles in the canyon alone. Can get off the pavement and run a trail for the first 3 miles or so then have to go back to paved path. Shaded, plenty of water and bathrooms."
68,2015-07-13,['camping'],This is the easiest trial ever and it's paced all the way you can walk under the trees for the shade just go early in the morning
69,2015-06-11,[''],"This is more of a nature walk than a hike. I have only been up to mile 3 or so. It is paved, some little hills. Beautiful for kids or beginners or when you don't want to go too far from salt lake. I love going in the winter months."
70,2015-05-31,['hiking'],"I am 42, we only did up to the 1st or 2nd mile and turned around.  I used to do this whole thing a few times 15 years ago when I used to marathon train.  Its a great paved hike with a couple bathroom and a few water stations. steady easy-moderate incline going uphill on the way up."
71,2015-05-11,[''],"Easy, but great views! close to downtown, but just far enough away to feel like you're somewhere else."
72,2015-05-07,[''],Loved this hike.
73,2014-08-11,[''],Great trail and so close by..Check it out
74,2012-08-24,['mountain biking'],"One of my favorite cardio rides both in the Summer and Fall. Nice paved road that is about 7 miles long one way and has some nice climbs, great views of the surrounding foothills and downtown Salt Lake City. The ride is pretty easy for a few miles but the last three miles can be a grind on your legs if you are not used to some steep hills and like to just ride without stopping. You follow City Creek up and at the top, there is a nice stone bridge with the creek flowing underneath. There is also a big picnic area at the top for those days when cars are allowed up to the top."
