1,2019-09-07,['hiking'],"Did not realize that this was the day of the Cirque Series race, so took service roads to the top of the tram in order to not get in the way of the runners on the ridge trail. Not god for my self-esteem to have literally hundreds of people demonstrating that they could get to the top twice as fast as me."
2,2019-09-05,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Summited Hidden peak and Baldy via service roads and rothmans way to ridge trail and cirque traverse. Once hit hidden peak, went around to chips run and down gorillas pass to baldy. Took tram down so I didn’t fully gas my self as this was a training for the discrete cirque series trail run"
3,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']","This was a great hike! Hardest parts are the first pitch up the ski slope, then the last bit along the ridge line up to the summit lodge. Beautiful flowers, awesome views, and a little strenuous but not deadly. Definitely take the tram down — it’s free from hidden peak :)"
4,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Amazing hike 

Gloves for the scramble would have been helpful - the volcanic rock section can cut up your hands

I hiked up from the Snowbird parking lot,  but took the tram down because...why not?"
5,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Summited yesterday. The hike was beautiful and green. The scramble along the spine is at times hard to follow but the trail up the summit was more visible. Nice hike not too difficult.
6,2019-07-21,['hiking'],Made it to both Twin Peaks. The scramble after the snowbird summit is kinda sketchy going up but I really enjoyed it going down. Almost no shade for this entire hike so go early. Total hike was just under 6 hours with very few stops.
7,2019-07-05,['hiking'],There's still quite a bit of snow about halfway up the trail as of 7/5/19 so I had to turn back and didn't get to ride the tram but even halfway up and back was an intense and beautiful hike.
8,2018-07-29,['hiking'],Gorgeous views. A wonderful knife edge scramble that was amazing.
9,2017-07-24,['hiking'],"There are multiple ways to get from the Snowbird base to the top of Hidden Peak, on both the Peruvian and the Gad valley sides. The summer trail map on the Snowbird website shows them all. Some are shorter than others, but they are all strenuous, because you are climbing 3000 ft over a relatively short distance, and at a high elevation to boot. I always go up the Peruvian Ridge trail for the last part, because the views are great and the attention I have to pay to not slipping off the side partially distracts me from the sense that I am about to have a heart attack. The wildflowers are beautiful right now and it's awesome that you can ride the tram down after 10 AM. If you want to hang out and get food and drink, there's plenty of options. Even music sometimes. Not a wilderness experience, but still excellent."
10,2017-07-01,[''],Great hike to get your blood pumping! No shade on this one so wear a hat! My husband and I loved being able to get a cold drink and snack at the top of the tram when we made it to the top.
11,2017-06-25,['hiking'],This a hiking/scrambling/bouldering trail. Sharp rocks and steep cliffs. Experienced hikers. Not kid friendly. Sturdy hiking boots.
12,2016-09-06,[''],"It seems like the majority of these reviewers  went to Hidden Peak, but I went up to the Twin Peaks. The trail leading to hidden peak was great with plenty of good views. However the trail leading to the twin peaks was difficult to see and extremely treacherous if you use the ridge trail (I do not advise this one as there is loose rock everywhere and the sides are shear). There's another trail on the backside of the peaks but you have to drop a lot of elevation and then climb up some steep switchbacks. This trail is easier to follow and much less treacherous but about 2 miles longer. The peaks were nice but definitely a strenuous hike."
13,2016-08-28,[''],almost challenging!! lake was beautiful
14,2016-08-14,['hiking'],Wow!!! Kicked my ass but well worth it.  Kid friendly but bring food and lots of water.
15,2016-07-19,['trail running'],awesome
16,2015-10-06,[''],"Loved this hike, wonderful views!  It was overcast and raining but the fall colors were gorgeous and temperature just right!"
17,2015-09-10,['hiking'],"Fun hike, very pretty views of Little Cottonwood and the Snowbird Resort. We even saw 2 moose along the way."
18,2015-07-27,['hiking'],Pretty steep on some parts. Still a wonderful hike all around. :D
19,2015-07-20,['hiking'],"Since Peruvian Gulch was closed on the day we visited Snowbird, we had to go though Gad Valley Trail #52 to reach Hidden Peak (where the tram stops on top). There are many steep spots and loose rocks on the trail. But you are rewarded by seeing a lot of wild flowers, many wild animals, and the magnificent views of the peaks nearby. You can take the tram down for free when it is open.

The trail is not well marked. But it is hard to miss, given the width of the trail and many signs of the ski slopes."
20,2015-07-13,[''],Great and beautiful views!
21,2014-08-18,['hiking'],"The reviews that led me to this trail for my first hike while visiting the SLC area were spot-on: a fairly strenuous hike, scenic hike and just the right distance for an ex-mountain dweller who's been living at sea level for far too long. Saw a few mule deer and recent mountain lion scat up on the ridge.

When I hiked it on 16 Aug, the Lower Peruvian Gulch trail was closed for construction; use the Black Jack return until the two meet back up."
22,2014-01-15,['hiking'],This is one of the best/most fun ridge hikes I have done. I hope to be able to do this hike each time I visit.
23,2013-03-15,['hiking'],"I hike to the peak all year.  During ski season you must get an early start to be on top by 9 am.  Beautiful sunrise in the clear winter mornings.  But it can be cold if the wind is blowing .

25,2012-07-25,['hiking'],"If you are into the bigger day hikes(15-20mi) then you can hike the shoulder to Baldy, take the shoulder from Baldy to Sugarloaf, go down the backside of Sugarloaf to Secret lake, and from there down through Alta. best hike I've ever had, and I now repeat it at least once every year. If you only do the listed hike the crowds are really light until you get to the top of Hidden peak since a lot of people take the tram up and down. If you leave the main hike you won't see anyone until secret lake."
26,2012-07-16,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike! if you ski or board Snowbird, you must hike this trail in the summer. "
