We stopped by Bloods lake first to cool off and might have stopped again on the way back if it weren’t for our lack of bug spray.  The 300ft stretch of boulder field was tricky for dogs.  We went around right on the way there and straight over coming back.  Both ways were rough."
1,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Wonderful, tough hike. Guardsman Pass parking lot is closed as of early July. There is a sign that says there is a new lot and new trail 1 mi east of the previous lot. We parked along the road a short walk away and took the previous trailhead and that worked fine too. There’s two steep climbs to 2 peaks with stunning 360 views. Last ~0.2 mi is a scramble across the ridge over large rocks. Wear and bring bug spray. We enjoyed going down to Bloods Lake on the way back for a change of scenery and it was gorgeous - definitely recommend that."
2,2018-10-07,[''],Nice short hike up to Clayton Peak. It is steep to begin with. At the top instead of going over the boulders I went west or to the right around them then up to the peak. Not much boulder hopping that way. It was snow at the top so the views were limited but still amazing. Then I went down to Blood Lake. Beautiful area. Fall leaves were beautiful in the snow.
3,2018-09-19,['hiking'],The views are worth it but the path near the top is a little tricky with all those boulders to cross.  I really enjoyed Bloods Lake.  I would go again just for that area alone however the dog poop bags were very unpleasant to have to pick up.  So disgusting!  Please pick up after your pets.  Do NOT leave the bags on the side to pick up later because you may forget and it pollutes the area and makes it unpleasant for hikers walking by when they are trying to enjoy the scenery.  Thanks!
4,2018-09-13,['hiking'],Awesome hike. Absolutely beautiful on the peaks!
5,2018-08-19,['hiking'],this is definitely not 10.3 miles I think it's closer to 7.5. At the top of Clayton is a stretch of about 100 m of Boulders that you have to climb through it is not a path. Might be hard for dogs
6,2018-07-16,['trail running'],Mileage is wrong.  Less than 4 miles.  Lots of rocks to slow you down if you are running.  Amazing vistas at the top and a couple nearby lakes to cool you down.
7,2018-07-08,['hiking'],"This was a cool and difficult hike. The climbs to the peak were definitely difficult and we stopped a few times for water and to catch our breath. The view from the second peak is beyond gorgeous! Great views of the 2 or 3 lakes that we were near. We actually ended up scrambling down from the second peak towards the lake and then went to the trail that led to Bloods Lake. However, even if we did the loop that was specified, it would not have been 10 mikes. The hike, at most, is 5.5 miles round trip."

9,2017-02-01,['hiking'],pretty hike and saw some moose running in the rain on our drive down.
10,2016-07-28,[''],"This trail offers great views, the trail takes you up and down in many areas.  The gravel/dirt is very loose coming down."
11,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Fun, challenging, short day hike with excellent views.  The trail is rough and can be loose in places.  I recommend trekking poles.   Encountered significant amounts of mosquitos!"
12,2015-10-04,['hiking'],Loved it! The view was breathtaking and there were plenty of options to take other side trails. I look forward to exploring this area again.
13,2015-09-05,['hiking'],"Just did this one again about a year after I did it the first time. I loved it even more, even though the wind was raging and it was hard to stand upright at the peak without being blown over. Fantastic views in all directions. If you have some extra time head down to Lackawaxen Lake after the peak. There is a clear trail to the lake. It's not far after you get to the saddle between Clayton and Peak 10420. Very secluded and pretty. Well worth the extra 10 minutes to get to the lake."
14,2014-09-20,['hiking'],"Did this one September 20, 2014. I love this hike! You get two peaks for the price of one. It's a short hike but pretty steep. Take the path on the right at the Guardsman Pass parking lot. You'll go up and over Peak 10,420 and continue on to the saddle between that peak and Clayton Peak and right on up. A bit of boulder hopping near the summit of Clayton but nothing too scary or tricky. You'll see the Mount Majestic ski lift from Brighton on the west side of the peak. Lovely view in all directions from the summit. Well worth the elevation gain."
