1,2019-08-23,['hiking'],The Battle Creek side has a large section that is closed for construction for another week. We had to turn around halfway and come back down Grove Creek.

3,2019-07-25,['hiking'],Loved it so much beauty and water.   It was challenging enough but not too challenging. Would recommend 
4,2019-07-20,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'washed out']","I have a lot to say about this hike having just completed it this morning:)...so while it’s fresh, I wanted to jot down a few notes so it can help someone. We definitely needed these tips so I’ll pass these on. Brevity nothing...

This hike is completely scenic and beautiful- 5 stars for the beauty, undoubtedly. Utah Lake looks like the Caribbean from up there and the mountains were lush with verdant greenery. It’s really oooh-awww stunning! 

My 3-star rating is a result, however, of the trail’s condition, clarity, and direction. My cousin and I are pretty experienced hikers and have spent a lot of time on mountains in California and Utah. This was by far the trickiest trail we’ve been on. It was soooo poorly marked in spots- we veered off a number of times, adding significant distance to an already longish morning hike. Be sure to use the all-trails app map for this hike!!!- you will need the gps assistance if you’re not familiar with this area. In the same vein, make sure your phone is fully charged bc you will use most your battery with the all trails map (says the girl who’s phone died..wa waaa). Even when using the app, we had to stop many times and triple check, cross the river twice (and it was definitely shin-deep, white water rapids stuff), we had to backtrack, and we had to really focus on not getting lost!! It would’ve been easy to do! 

Next: wear pants! We were constantly brushing up against long grasses and trees- the trail is quite narrow and you’ll be up against a lot of vegetation most the time. You’ll also want shoes with really good traction! The run off made for slippery terrain. 

Another tip: if you’re going alone on this trail, just don’t. Be sure to go in a group of at least 3-4 people. We had enough scares with wildlife that being in a bigger group would’ve been more comforting. During the middle of the loop, as you approach the meadow section, and then down towards the Battle Creek side, we passed only a meager handful of people- it seemed really lonely and barren of human life. That can be a good thing for some people and not a good thing for others:) I would definitely not consider this particular loop “moderately trafficked” all the way through. We were alone for a couple of hours without seeing anyone. 


This hike also felt more arduous than I expected. It was hard uphill and steep downhill with some level hiking here and there; so take more water and food then you think you’ll need. Stay hydrated, be smart. 

We also started on the grove creek side and ended at the bottom of Battle Creek and then walked the last 1.5 mile through the neighborhood back to our car. We were done with trying to figure out the trail by that point.  The hike up to Battle Creek seemed like a great hike for families and kids- the falls are huge and spectacular and it isn’t too far up. 
I would not take my kids up to Grove Creek Falls, however- the trail is narrow and extremely steep with huge slopes down the sides that could be a deathly fall. It would be a good challenge for tweens- but under age 11-12, it seemed too sketchy to me. 

It’s a hard loop and it made for a huge adventure; but be prepared, do your research, and just be alert the whole time.

6,2019-07-12,['backpacking'],"Great hike!  It is well travelled so expect to come across many other hikers.  Indian Creek Campground is great and convenient with the spring for water needs; however, if you want to get away from the crowds, keep hiking for a half a mile and you'll find all the flat country you want to find a campsite."
7,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"This is a great hike, but two comments: first, the entire loop is actually about 9.5 miles according to my Apple Watch GPS, and second, this hike is really too hard for younger kids. We hike a fair bit so we took all 5 of ours, ranging from 1 to 14 and there's no way our 4 year old could have hiked it all. Our 6 year old did great, but it was really hard for her. Very steep on the way up and the meadows are amazing but it will be a while before we do this again with our kids."
8,2019-06-28,['hiking'],"I went there with my family 3 weeks ago, my younger is 11 years old and loved the hike. You got be a little adventurous though, we’ve noticed most of people don’t make to the top. The first mile and half is heavily trafficked , after the waterfall it gets more and more empty. If you hate snakes that isn’t for you.?There is a “snake party” going on in the meadows, hahaha! 
Snakes apart the meadows are truly breathtaking. On my opinion the loop isn’t for family with small children otherwise you’ll have a great time!"
9,2019-06-23,['backpacking'],"For the record.. it’s beautiful, and I loved MOST of the Hike.  I’m really just confused as to why no one seems to acknowledge or mention the risks associated with this trail, particularly the top of the the grove creek side.  Maybe they review the trail without ever making it through the loop? The trail definitely has some hazards, with a risk of death/serious injury on misstep, and very little trail maintenance. Especially with a 50lb backpack on. NO WAY would I allow my young daughter up there with me. If I had my daughter with me, we would stick to the Battle Creek side and avoid the risk.. maybe even go all the way to Indian Springs... but still backtrack.  It’s just not worth the risk—there is literally a memorial there, and the trail continues to degrade, with loose shale, and seemingly no maintenance. "

11,2019-06-09,['hiking'],Like Grove Creek side way better than Battle Creek side but it’s steep. The top is beautiful. Walking poles would have been helpful when crossing some of the streams. Nice hike but I wouldn’t do it again. Crowded on the way down. 
12,2019-06-09,['hiking'],"Beautiful area with minimal people, even on a Sunday. Dog was able to run and have a good time! Only time there was major groups of people was the Battle Creek falls area, which is to be expected. Up on top was great and secluded and soooo green!"
13,2019-06-09,['hiking'],We completed the loop on Sunday. Great trail. Mileage is actually about 9.5 miles to return to original parking. We started at Grove Creek and came down Battle Creek. 8.2 is from parking to Kiwanis parking and doesn’t include the crossing back which is about 1.25 miles more. When walking the trail you come to a dirt road. You have to turn left on the road to continue. Our map on the phone had trusted so we had to walk a minute to realize we went the wrong way. Not a big deal since we only walked about 50 feet when the map updated. The grassy meadows on top are great but there are rattlesnakes so be careful. We encountered on about 2 feet from the trail. As we came down we reached a point where the water flow had covered the trail. We finally realized to stay left of the water. It will probably be better once the water goes down some.. we will do it again in reverse to see which way is better. Next time we are planning an overnight camp.
14,2019-06-02,['hiking'],"june 2
beautiful time of year to hike this trail "
15,2019-05-26,[''],"beautiful hike with a waterfall, saw some mountain goats on the way back just relaxing on the cliffs"
16,2019-05-25,['hiking'],"Good trail. It came out a bit over 8.2 miles by the time finished. But great hike overall. Snow still in the back peaks, but not bad. Just a lil muddy on trail."
17,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'muddy']","The dog and I did the loop starting from Battle Creek today (May 25)..There is still a few inches of snow up near the meadow.  Heading from the meadow north down the hill towards the spring became very muddy/slushy/slippery.  The rest of the hike had a few mud spots but not bad.  Overall nice hike with varying landscapes...Saw a couple deer.  The final leg south from Grove Creek parking area down to Battle Creek parking on the shoreline trail -has no shade and would be brutal on a hot day.  The water is flowing super strong and high right now- making the water falls (especially in Grove Creek canyon) amazing.. I prefer descending down Grove Creek more than Battle Creek - have done the loop both directions and prefer starting at Battle creek and heading up, easier on the knees for me.  My garmin showed about 8.4 miles total.."
18,2019-05-13,[''],"went on a Sunday starting on the battle Creek side. Sunday is a popular hiking day to go to battle Creek falls, so lots of people to that point. then had the trail to myself. super quite and beautiful!"
19,2019-05-10,['backpacking'],"Good trail with some decent elevation gain and fantastic views. As of 5/10-11/19, there was still a little bit of snow in the higher areas of the trail, but it was not deep and was easy to manage. I would definitely do this hike again."
20,2019-05-06,['hiking'],A great loop! Next time I will park at the Battle Creek trailhead to get the shoreline trail portion out of the way first. Waterfalls were great! Still some snow at top but easy to maneuver. Can’t wait to do this one again!
21,2019-05-04,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'no shade', 'rocky']",Went straight up from the parking lot and it was probably 2.5 miles of straight uphill from then. At the top got lost because there is still quite a bit of snow but was able to find the trail quickly. The waterfalls right now are beautiful! Definitely will consider hiking this again when all the flowers are blooming!
22,2019-04-25,[''],"I have hiked this canyon over 135 times, and I have never seen the waterfalls be as pretty as they were last night (April 23) .  I think there are 10 waterfalls to watch for here 4 in the bottom tier, 4 in the top tier, 2 with the V shape above the bridge, and you could also probably count the waterfall the natural spring is making another.  I would get up and do this canyon soon!  Also watch for the sweet pea flowers.  Bridge is crooked, so I don't think I would be spending too much time hanging out on it.  Something is off with it.    I did a blog about this hike if you want to see all the falls and how pretty they are right now at shaunasadventures dot com  search Grove Creek."
23,2019-04-13,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",very snowy towards the top. didn’t need snow shoes but it definitely would’ve helped. knee deep in a lot of places.

27,2019-01-04,['hiking'],This hike is one of my favorites. The beauty and serenity of the meadows is why I keep doing it. I prefer going to grove creek and down battle creek.
28,2018-11-23,[''],This is a great loop trail with no technical difficulties for 11 years old and normal adults. The scenic view at the meadow which is over G Mountain is really great!
29,2018-09-27,[''],simply awe inspiring!
30,2018-07-09,[''],"One of my favorite trails in this area. Go early because the trail is mostly in the sun. I went the first day and turned around (started to late in the day). The next day started at 6:30. Incline is not too hard, scenery beautiful, and trail clearly defined.  You get all kinds of scenery- cliffs, wooded areas, meadows. It’s just lovely."
31,2018-06-17,['hiking'],Great exercise! The first half going uphill made me appreciate that I was done when the back half came. Saw a mother skunk w her 5 little babies on the trail. Without the map I would have likely taken a few wrong turns.
32,2018-06-12,['hiking'],Great trail for a good workout.  4 miles ascending then 4 miles descending.  Bring trekking poles for some moderate down hill over rocks.
33,2018-06-03,['hiking'],"This is a great trail. Up through Grove Creek was very scenic and the waterfalls before you hit the aspen groves and  meadows are very nice. 
I would have given it a 5 star rating but the descent through Battle Creek was almost all loose rock on the steep trail made for very slow going coming down. 
My gps said it was a 10.4 mile hike not 8.2 as the app suggests. 
I will do this trail again."
34,2018-06-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful scenery on this trail, including a creek and small waterfalls. The higher up you go the more beautiful it gets. Lots of dogs off leash and far from their owners, which was an issue for my apprehensive puppy."
35,2018-05-21,['hiking'],"Great hike! First few miles are a little hard since they’re uphill, but the views and falls were worth it."
36,2018-04-26,['hiking'],"I started at the grove Creek trailhead. It was a spectacular day. The most beautiful spot on the hike is where the trail crosses Grove Creek to the southside on the wooden foot bridge. Higher up, you have to make sure that you turn right on trail 151. I missed the turn, and walked all the way up to Timpanookee Road. The detour was OK, but the trail takes you through aspen groves and across a huge meadow at Chris Flat. The view of the western slope of Mount Timpanogus from that meadow is grand. Part of the trail in the upper part of Battle Creek Canyon is very steep and Rocky. The trail eventually joins the stream as it tumbles down the canyon, and there are some picturesque waterfalls. The meadows in the high area should be beautiful in another month or so."
37,2018-04-22,['hiking'],"Loved this hike.  We started at Battlecreek and ended up at Grove Creek.  Grove Creek is a new favorite.  We stopped and filled up water at the spring at the top.  Can't wait to do this again when the trees and wildflowers are out.

My phone registered the whole loop at 9.3 miles.  If you park a car at each trailhead and don't do the last leg, it is 8.2 miles.  The trail had only a few muddy spots.  Glad I took my GPS trail tracker.  There's limited signage, and many places you can take a wrong turn."
38,2018-04-22,['hiking'],"The meadow was a great spot for a lunch break! Beautiful views. 
If you're bringing Fido, there are a lot of dogs off-leash here."
39,2018-04-21,['hiking'],"Hiked on April 21, 2018. The trail was completely clear of snow minus a 20 ft section. There are stunning views of the valley and mountains. At the very top there is a huge meadow that has the best mountain views of the hike. Many waterfalls throughout the hike!"
40,2018-04-15,[''],It's awesome and very beautiful!
41,2018-04-05,['hiking'],Trail is clear and wide at the beginning. Nice hike and no snow.
42,2018-01-18,[''],Love this hike and the changes in terrain. Love the bench that is right before the main waterfall.
43,2017-12-13,[''],"the dog and i did the grove creek to battle creek hike yesterday..nice to get above the inversion and very warm up top...scenery was beautiful, switching from jagged cliffs to waterfalls, to meadows and back..up at indian spring meadows area (i think that's the name) lots of deer...on the way down battle creek canyon there are a few really slick icy spots covering the trail...loved this hike.."
44,2017-12-05,[''],"Beautiful views of the valley, shear cliffs and a waterfall!"
45,2017-11-06,[''],"One of the most beautiful hikes I’ve been on. Every corner you turned, there was new scenery. Beautiful fall leaves & running water along side you."
46,2017-08-16,[''],Lots of fun definitely go for a experience hiker
47,2017-08-12,[''],amazing. But it didn't feel moderate to me. hard work to get up to the falls but absolutely beautiful there after
48,2017-08-10,[''],"Once you cross the waterfall, this is spectacular. Beautiful, not overly challenging, and diverse. Awesome hike."
49,2017-07-31,['backpacking'],"Really pretty trail, but do it early as most of the trail is exposed to sun.  There is a artesian spring at the crossing with awesome water."
50,2017-07-15,['backpacking'],11 year old scouts loved it.
51,2017-07-09,[''],Incredible views! A nice tough hike that is well worth it.
52,2017-07-04,[''],This is good as it gets when you're only a couple miles from your house to be able to get up into the mountains quickly amazing hike.
53,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"Great, moderate hike with beautiful meadows between the Grove Creek and Battle Creek trails, and a few waterfalls along the way. Only bummer was the last, dusty 1.1 mile stretch between Grove Creek and Battle Creek falls. Next time, I may just do an out and back starting from the Grove Creek Parking and up to the meadows.
There's a few sections there are a bit steep for the kiddos. 
Wildlife: Turkey, Deer, snakes, birds"
54,2017-06-21,['hiking'],"I really enjoyed this hike for the most part. While the scenery was beautiful the whole way, I'd have given this 5 stars if there was some kind of summit or overlook. The hike was a little anticlimactic ending on the part that connects the two parking lots. We started at the grove creek lot and went clockwise which is definitely what I would recommend. Then meadows at the top are enchanting. It was also lovely to see two waterfalls and the spring. Really great hike, took about 4 hours to complete the loop."
55,2017-06-17,['hiking'],"This is a very beautiful hike with two waterfalls and meadows on the top. Indian Springs is a good place to refill water bottles. The Grove Creek side is steeper, rockier, and sunnier. The Battlecreek side is more forested, and therefore shadier. 

It took about 4.5 hours at an average pace with a .5 hour break starting from the Grove Creek parking lot and looping around clockwise. If I hiked this again (which I would), I would still go clockwise, but park in the Battlecreek parking lot instead."
56,2017-06-04,['hiking'],"The highlight of this hike for me is definitely the beautiful meadows at the top. I recommend starting with the flat walk between the two canyons or parking a car at the mouth of each canyon. 

There are some spots on the Grove Creek side where you can take the wrong trail, but if you follow the map on All Trails you won't get lost.

Also it gets extremely crowded around the falls on the Battle Creek side, so be prepared for that.

It also gets pretty steep going downhill, and I wish I had brought trecking poles."
57,2017-05-13,[''],"I don't know how this isn't rated well into the high fours! This is one of my favorite hikes ever! Seems like the low ratings come from people who weren't prepared for the distance or the climb. It's moderately steep.

Mid May is a gorgeous time to go! Everything is green and the waterfalls and streams are full of water. The meadow at the top is the biggest, most beautiful mountain meadow I've ever seen. And it hikes right under Timp! And since I hit the meadow around 7 pm, the deer were starting to come out to feed. I drank from the spring, it was refreshing!

As far as distance, there's no way this is is 10 like some reviewers say. The Battle Creek portion is 2.5 miles, the Grove Creek portion to the spring is 2.8 miles. The stretches in between are maybe a mile to a mile and half tops?

However, the all trails map is wrong. If you start heading up Grove creek then across the top to the Battle Creek trail, you'll actually drop down into Battle Creek canyon sooner than the map says. There are signs that guide you though. If you follow the map, then maybe it really is closer to ten."
58,2017-05-07,['hiking'],"Took my husky/collie mix. She loved it, me not so much. party of that was that it was 3 miles longer than expected. this app said a little over 7. 10.19 miles is what my GPS and fitness tracker marked. If I ever did this again I would probably start with the part that connects Grove Creek and Battle Creek as that was a very ugly and anticlimactic ending for me this time. Unless your buns and thighs are in top shape I would recommend trekking poles. Make sure you either know which trails/roads to take our you have a GPS. We saw deer, a turkey, and a crazy bird that scared us to death!"
59,2017-04-30,['hiking'],Heading up Grove Creek to the falls isn't the prettiest trail but once you get into the pines at the waterfall it is really nice the rest of the way.  There is a spring at the top which I've used for years. The meadows at the top are amazing.
60,2017-03-19,[''],"I'll definitely go again. funnest hike with the best sights I've seen yet in the area, my friend couldnt complete it but I thought it was perfect!"
61,2017-03-18,['hiking'],"Fun trail! It was a little steep at the beginning for the kids, but they powered through. We only got 1 mile up and even from there out had stunning views of Utah Lake and various mountain ranges."
62,2016-12-27,['backpacking'],"11.19.2016 | 15lb Backpack | Recommend Sunscreen

My GSD and I completed the full loop from Grove Creek to Battle Creek and loved it! Indian Springs is a great place to take a breather and soak in the views but the best part is reaching the saddle. Timp is majestic! The Battle Creek side is rockier and steeper so it was slow going down--my least favorite part. This is a fairly strenuous hike (especially with a pack) and exposed so I highly recommend sun protection.

There were a lot of people hiking up Grove Creek to the falls and I met a few people on the way down Battle Creek but there wasn't a soul in the saddle which enhanced my experience. It was an absolutely stunning, peaceful hike that I hope to do again next year."
63,2016-11-15,['backpacking'],"11.12.2016 | 15lb Backpack

For a Saturday, the Grove Creek trail was busy but not overwhelming. My GSD and I made it to the falls which is a decent climb but not too far from the trailhead. There are lots of cross trails, so be sure to have a map or ask someone for directions! You'll start by heading East into the canyon, switchback to the face of the mountain overlooking PG and then cut East again. 

There are definitely some narrow sections but nothing too intimidating. Just be sure you're paying attention to your feet on the way down as the rocks can be slippery.

Apparently after the falls you cross a bridge and move from rocky/scrubby terrain to meadow/pine tree terrain which sounds like nice variety. I really enjoyed the valley views on the way down and definitely want to come back to complete the loop.

Overall it's peaceful, beautiful and a good leg burner!"
64,2016-11-09,[''],I think it's harder then Moderate..
65,2016-09-26,['hiking'],"This was an AWESOME hike!  The fall foliage is breath taking with the snowy mountains as a backdrop.  Literally this was the most beautiful hike I've ever been on.  Be sure to bring lots of water and snacks.  Parts of the trail are muddy and at times you have to traverse the creek, and my feet got wet, so wear good waterproof shoes if you have them.  The hike down was steep and would probably not be good for someone with bad knees.  

You will need to download and use the GPS map included in AllTrails Pro or some other GPS system to navigate, there's too many opportunities to take the wrong way.  Also, make sure you have someone pick you up because you will end up at a different parking lot than where you started; the trail ends around Kiwanis park."
66,2016-09-21,[''],"LOVED this loop.  The trees are exploding with color up battle creek side and at the top of the loop!  Magical! I suggest going up battle creek and down the other, just my opinion.  Top of the loop can be confusing, watch for signs, access roads can confuse you which way to go.  The spring at Indian Campground was real cool.  Also I suggest two cars, one at each parking lot...walking back over to Kiwanis parking lot from the other canyon was confusing, no shade and rough trying to figure which road to follow...which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  Otherwise this was a great hike and worth the uphill/downhill efforts.  My dog loved the water and adventure."
67,2016-08-01,[''],Great hike for adults. Definitely not for little kids as trail follows some steep cliffs up grove creek and is quite steep. Beautiful views when you are up behind the G mountain. Took about 2.5 hours at moderate pace. We parked a car at the mouth of each canyon - so we didn't do the complete loop.
68,2016-07-09,[''],Beautiful hike. Fairly strenuous. I hiked it two days ago and didn't encounter any flies or overgrown trails.
69,2016-07-02,[''],"I forgot to mention that it was recorded at 9.5 miles from Grove Creek trailhead to Battle Creek trail head. so if you complete the loop it would be over 10.5
Alltrails doeznt seem to have it accurate."
70,2016-06-27,[''],"It was such a beautiful hike up there. We've had plenty of rain and things are really green. I saw a large buck duck into the tree line and a doe stood there watching me as I made my way through the meadow connecting to the top of Battle Creek trail. 

I'd like to go again with friends and family. Maybe hammocking"
71,2016-06-25,[''],great day for hiking. Eagle project we cleared some of the over g r owth on the lower trail and creek bed for easier access  and viewing pleasure.
72,2016-06-12,['hiking'],"There's a lot of cool rock formations to look at, and good views over the valley."
73,2016-05-30,[''],"kid friendly? maybe if the kid you take is a step kid you hate. also, according to my fitbit this hike is actually more like 12 miles long. very beautiful. if you want to be an overachiever, hike up to the G too!"
74,2016-05-04,['hiking'],"When I got to the spring I was looking at Mahogany and that mountain pulled me to the summit.  Of course my legs had to help but I didn't have a choice but to climb the east face that looked fun from the spring, wow was I wrong. It looked great from afar but far from great doing it. I had to remove my dogs backpack because he couldn't push thru the brush. Once we got to the ridge it was just a bare uphill to the summit . I decided to go down the south east ridge to meet the trail at the bridge. Well it got dark on us before we got to the south end of the ridge so I used my gps to navigate down. We ended up sliding down the shale shuts and landing on the trail at the water fall. That was a blast listing to the sound of the shale slide at night .  It was over 4,000 feet of elevation gained from the parking lot to the summit of Mahogany. My dogs enjoyed this hike and  there is plenty of water in sagebrush flat."
75,2016-05-02,['trail running'],"Completed the loop and added Big Baldy. It took more than 5 hours. If you exclude Big Baldy, I think the loop would take about 3 hours. I would recommend Battle Creek to Grove Greek loop which would be nicer for your knees and ankles.  Battle Creek is steeper than Grove Creek. I would rather hike up steeper uphill and run less steeper downhill."
76,2016-04-10,['hiking'],Completed the loop still snow on the connector trail between Grove Creek and Battle Creek Trail. Great views.
77,2016-03-28,[''],"Still a lot of snow toward the top, making it hard to follow the trail (thanks to your map we didn't get to lost) "
78,2016-03-13,['hiking'],We have a good time with good friends!!
79,2016-01-04,[''],Intense hike with beautiful scenery. The meadow on top was gorgeous and full of wild flowers.
80,2015-11-16,['hiking'],"This hike was a treat, and the area back between Grove and Battle Creek Canyons is worth the climb. The trails aren't very clearly marked, both in Grove Creek Canyon (take a left when available) and in the back area. If you're looking to do the complete loop, go through Kiwanis Park and continue to follow the trial all the way out to some gravel roads. They'll take you back to Grove Creek. Overall, this one was great, and we all really enjoyed the views, and the dogs loved the open areas and random deer carcasses."
81,2015-08-28,['hiking'],"This was not an easy hike, but it was beautiful and very rewarding. You pass a handful of waterfalls, have great views of Timp and Utah Lake, and come across springs and meadows as well as forested areas. I would very highly recommend this hike to anyone who is at least a fairly experienced hiker. My buddy and I started on the trailhead at 5pm and with some stops to take pictures of the views were off the mountain by 930. I want to come back and backpack it."
82,2015-07-14,[''],"Good hike , fairly easy trail but not clearly marked up on top. Took about 6 hrs with lots of stops . Some great views!"
83,2014-09-15,[''],Beautiful hike especially in the fall. Trail was a bit washed out on the battle creek side due to all the rainfall we've been having. Glad I went with a friend who knew her way around once we got to the top!  Definitely a hike I will do again.
84,2014-09-02,[''],Beautiful scenery from grove creek to battle creek. The hike down through battle creek was steep.
85,2013-06-05,['hiking'],"Breathtaking
My brother and I backpacked to the top and overnighted in a remote meadow, the pack made the hike a fair amount more difficult due to some steep climbs near the beginning. 
As you continue up the trail and get to mile 1, take the fork that leads into the canyon, North, or else you'll loop around to a lot of mountain biking trails (which i frequently rode and love) and my eventual exit. 
We hiked up at dark with headlamps and a few parts were kinda sketchy due to the ledges and shale, but the trip down took 1/2 the time and the views the whole time were absolutely STUNNING!!! :) 

I take pictures all over of everywhere I go, check em out!"
86,2013-05-31,['hiking'],"I would park at Grove Creek and go up there. Then come down Battle Creek because the Battle Creek side is much steeper. The Grove Creek Hike is broken up with some pretty nice views that you can take in while you rest. There is a spring in the meadow at the top. You could overnight it there if you would like. If you ever have noticed the ""G"" on the mountain, this loop basically goes right around it. Battle Creek in Pleasant Grove is 200 North and Grove Creek is about 1100 north. So we just walked back to our truck....no biggie."
87,2013-05-26,['hiking'],"This is a fun trail with a quick payoff. as soon as you leave the parking lot and head up the hill you will head up a steep incline. Once you get past the first big climb it leveled out and was mostly a mile incline from there. 

Follow the wide trail for a half mile or so until a smaller single track trail branches off to the left. Follow that trail as far as you want with the meadow about two miles from the parking lot. Less then a mile up the hill you can look back and see some great views of the valley and Utah Lake."
88,2012-07-09,['hiking'],"This hikes pretty easy! We went up Battle creek and back down Grove creek. Make sure you park a car at Grove creek then drive the other car to Battle creek to start otherwise you will walk an extra mile and a half back to your car when you are done. When your at the top make sure you follow the trail to Grove creek, do not follow the dirt road because you will come to a dead end! Also, go early because when you hike down Grove creek you are against that rock mountain and the sun beats down on you! It was really hot (bring sunscreen) haha Overall it's really gorgeous with all the waterfalls and its fairly easy :) "
89,2010-08-08,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful trip with great views.  Grovecreek trail is a good climb but not a constant climb.  There are switchbacks in it to make it reasonable.  it is ablout 2.5 miles up then about a mile across the top of G mountain, and then about 2.3 miles down Battlecreek.  Batlecreek is steep so you don't necessarily get the extra speed of downhill hiking.  If you really want a workout hike it the otherway.  Battlecreek to Grovecreek loop."
