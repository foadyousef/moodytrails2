1,2019-07-02,['hiking'],"Hiked this at 8:30 a.m. today. The trail is a thin path to the right of the trailhead that leads down to Blood's Lake. Easy to miss. It was a steep climb to the top with a lot of snow that obscured the trail about 3/4 way up. We couldn't see the trail so walked on the snow. Personally scared me a bit but glad we kept going. highly recommend shoes with good tread. Also, might wait a couple of weeks for the snow to melt. Views at the top were great!"

3,2018-09-03,['hiking'],very fun to do at sunset !
4,2018-06-29,[''],"Super pretty, a very steep climb to the top! Bring bug repellent in the summer."
5,2017-09-30,[''],A lot tougher than expected... but amazing views at sunset!
6,2017-07-19,['hiking'],The views on this trail are just fantastic! We had 9 kids ranging from 3-12 yrs old and they all did pretty well. It's steep and the loose dirt can cause slipping. We actually used this trail hiking back out from Lackawaxen so we went down the steep part. Most of the kids sat on their rears and slid down.
7,2017-05-07,[''],Lots of snow still. Hiked up from Park City side. Gonna be a while before it all melts.
8,2017-01-15,['snowshoeing'],"Parked at the winter trailhead and snowshoed up the road to the first switchback and headed up the Mill F fork to Guardsman Pass. From the pass we hiked down the Blood Lake trail to Blood lake on an easy to follow trail through the snow. From Bloods lake we headed south towards Lackawaxen Lake but tried heading directly towards the pass between Peak 10,420 and Clayton Peak which turn out being a pore choice and had a sketchy exposed slope that I didn't like. From the pass we headed up Peak 10,420 and was treated to a great view of the area. Descended down to Guardsman pass and returned down the Mill F fork to the road but continued down a well traveled path through the snow in Mill F fork until we were parallel the original trailhead and followed a well travel path back to the car. Great loop. (see recorded track)"
9,2016-09-15,[''],very nice and short as a morning or evening hike.
10,2015-04-24,['hiking'],This is a great sunset walk that we bring our dogs on most nights in the summer. It is along a ridge so usually we opt for the lesser traveled side that gives you views from the top of the Daly Chutes at Deer Valley.
