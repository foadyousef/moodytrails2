Better than playing fort-night like all the other kids anyway.  Beautiful vistas, wildflowers, with a reward of a cold beer or red bull at 11,000'.  I can't think of any other place like this.  Nice and cool as well, usually windy.  If you're a real wuss you can take the tram down.  I did, as I dislike hiking downhill and I have no shame in admitting this."

2,2019-08-10,['hiking'],"We hiked up Peruvian gulch and Gps tracked 4.1 miles one way. 600-700ft elevation gain per mile. We were looking forward to a cold drink at the summit but it was closed for a wedding. We were more than a little pissed. This is a pretty hard trail (we're experienced hikers but were carrying a toddler) mostly up a road. Also Kind of annoying to have people on the lift yelling sarcastic comments at times. Really pretty trail and amazing view at the top but hundreds of party guests really ruined it for us. The free tram ride down was super cool though and the dinner and atmosphere at the bottom really made it a night to remember. Very unique hiking experience.

FYI the first part of Peruvian gulch is closed for construction so you have to take a little detour on the trail to the left."
3,2019-08-07,['hiking'],Long windy trail with greenery everywhere. However Lots of mosquitoes. I got 10 bites WITH bug-spray. Exposed so hike early and bring jacket for top.
4,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"Great hike that can be quite difficult with the elevation. I took the Cirque trail on the way up and it is the most difficult part. The trail is along a pretty steep ledge and you do not want to fall or make a miss step. That being said, the views are pretty incredible."

6,2019-07-27,['hiking'],Amazing views from all over. Good mix of in the trees and out in the open. Best part is grabbing a beer at the top and riding the tram back down! Trail is in great condition.
7,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"Gorgeous trail, but quite challenging. Well marked, and it is hard to beat a trail with a cold water refill station at the halfway point and a restaurant with local draft beers on tap at a summit with a grand view of the world. I found the ascent alone to be plenty of exercise and took the tram back down. Highly recommended."
8,2019-07-24,['hiking'],"Pretty steep climb, still a bit of snow on the way up. Beautiful views at the top ! "
9,2019-05-11,['hiking'],This is a great hike! It’s very scenic and not too hard. The nice thing about this hike is the fact that you don’t have to hike back down if you don’t want to because you can just take the tram back down.
10,2018-09-15,['hiking'],Great hike! The views were spectacular! Saw 2 moose on the way.  While finishing up we experienced a beautiful sunset highlighting the golden aspen leaves.
11,2018-07-19,['hiking'],"Great hike, beautiful way to enjoy the area in summer. Ridge trail is breathtaking, although the drop off on either side took it out of the woman in our group who was scared of heights. 4 stars mostly because of what others have said - the trail is poorly marked and the maps are pretty useless. All trails is a great help, since the resorts in the area don't seem to worried about marking summer activities."
12,2018-07-06,['trail running'],"Beautiful!  Get ready to climb, because that’s all you’re going to do until you get to the top! : )"
13,2018-06-16,[''],Great hiking trail just make sure to carry plenty of water. Views are espectacular. You can ride the gondola down for free if you reach the top. The trail is not that well marked.
14,2017-08-20,[''],"The wildflowers and beautiful. with ockoberfest happening at the base, I thought the trail would be more busy. But we had it to ourselves. The top of the tram and Peruvian was busy since you can take the lift up. Beautiful views all the way up."
15,2017-07-30,[''],The flowers were insanely beautiful. We took the tram up and hiked down. My knees and butt are dying today but it was worth it. I plan to hike up it in 2 weeks.
16,2017-07-16,['hiking'],"This is a hike I love to do every year. Especially during Oktoberfest. A lot of elevation climb but so worth it in the end. I see so many people coming down, which for me I can't justify paying to kill my knees. Hike up, enjoy the views and ride the tram down for free! Then treat yourself to nice cold beer!  "
17,2017-04-25,['hiking'],"This was my first big hike as a ""regular"" hiker, not having hiked much before but now weekly, and it was challenging. The first section is scrambling up a hillside and a winding, wide trail up Peruvian gulch. The fall colors were just starting to show. Several feet of snow toward the top made it a real work out; the weather was great. The views from the summit were amazing. I took the tram for free to go back down and enjoy Oktoberfest. I would recommend this hike, however, it gets precarious the last mile and those afraid of heights might not enjoy it."
