1,2019-06-27,['hiking'],"I saw 2 rattlesnakes hiking this trail.  So wear your snake gaiters.  There are also warning signs for snakes.  Keep a lookout for snakes.  I saw one on the trail and one on the rocks.   Both could have bitten me if I did not see them.  It is very steep and slippery.  It is like hiking on marbles on the way down.  lots of loose rocks.  Pretty dangerous  I would say.

2,2019-06-16,['hiking'],"I came down this trail today and the trail is just not in good shape.  It's mostly strait up the ridge on loose shale and dirt so it's very easy to fall.  With that being the case the going is very slow and it is hard to enjoy the view  because so much attention is required for placing every step.  I slid down several times, but luckily never fell completely.  I also lost the trail a few times and had to find it again.  That said the view is amazing.  In many spots you can see down into American Fork canyon as well as down into the valley toward Utah lake.  For most of the way it is grasses, sage, and a few junipers.  near the top there are a few conifer stands.  I saw a deer, a golden eagle, a red tail hawk, a turkey vulture, two snakes, one was a small rattle snake, and I heard a phesant calling, but didn't see it.  There was no snow on the trail today.  I'd say if you are careful, it's worth doing once."
3,2019-05-30,"['hiking', 'private property', 'rocky', 'scramble']","We went on this hike cuz we wanted a workout.   It is a workout.  It's just straight up.  Chances are you will be out of breath and your calves will be burning very quickly.

Here's how you get to this trail:  Look for a ""no tresspassing"" side on the side of the road with what looks to be a dirt road that could accomodate a car leading up.  Ignore the sign and follow that up. You'll come to a dillapated golf cart track.  Follow that up til you reach the actual golf cart track and then follow it around.  Leading off the golf cart track there will be a small trail leading up.  There were some folks golf and we ignored them and they ignored us.  If you don't want people walking on your golf course, don't build it in front of a hiking trail

Anyways, from there it's just straight up.  We took some detours and did some easy rock climbing.  Unfortunately I did not go all the way up because it was getting dark and my associates wanted to turn back.  Fun trail tho.   Very physically taxing."
4,2018-11-04,[''],Absolute murder - take your time on descent as some parts are loose. Very rewarding little peak.

6,2018-06-06,[''],"I like this hike for so many reasons. I love the steepness of the trail. I love the peace and quiet that you'll find because not many people are hiking this trail,  and there are spectacular views to see the whole time you are hiking it. It gives you a really good workout  because this hike is very challenging, and I would definitely not bring a beginner on it. Wear good hiking shoes that have traction. I found that it really wasn't that hard to get up the steep slopes if you're wearing the right shoes. Make sure you have plenty of time to get down the mountain because you will need to go slower, due to the loose gravel and rock. The slope is pretty steep and it can be hard on your knees, but if you hike slowly, you should have no problem."
7,2018-05-26,['hiking'],"Parked right next to the 5 mile marker. The only way in is to trespass a bit on the golf course. This hike was very dificult on my knees. There are some ledges at some point, but they can mostly be avoided."
8,2018-05-18,['hiking'],"well, I promised myself I wouldn't do it again, but decided that not only I'd do the north peak, but I'd work my way over to the tallest summit of the mountain.  It was 3.1 miles to the north peak from the golf course..I then worked my way over to Mt. Mahogany summit of 9,000..I live beneath it and just wanted to stand up there once..worked my way down from there through the brush and trees and deer trails the best I could and finally made it to Timpanogos Cove Park (wife had to pick me up, feet were dead).  Total distance 7.5 miles, total elevation gain 5,545 feet...coming down was pretty brutal, blisters, even with poles, but glad the dog and I did it..will download pics this week.."
9,2018-05-17,['trail running'],Quite an elevation gain over a short distance. A tough dig especially the last half mile to the top. Incredible views of the valley and time. A new favorite for sure.
10,2018-03-30,[''],"The most accessible way to the trail is by trespassing on golf course land. I couldn't find a better way to get on. The trail is very steep, and loose. The good views don't start for a while, but once you get to almost the top the trail is cool. If you are running it, be prepared for some wrecked thighs."
11,2017-10-28,['hiking'],"Hiked this route this morning. Took about 2.5 hours to summit and 1 to return. This hike has portions which are incredibly steep, and the addition of the trail being largely loose dirt and rock makes for both a difficult ascent and descent.

This trail's one saving grace is its view into AF Canyon throughout the majority of the route. I was a little late for the autumn foliage, but I can imagine that it would be gorgeous in early October."
12,2017-10-25,['hiking'],Super fun hike. Not for anyone that hasn't hiked quite a bit or is very active. I consistently run 50 miles a week and had to take many breaks on this hike.  extremely steep. round trip is about 5.5-6 miles.  this hike is no joke and I would consider it extremely difficult.
13,2017-09-17,['hiking'],"Tyler, we just moved here from the pacific northwest, we too stare at this mountain daily and decided to hike it as a warm up for Timp.  Wow, it was steep, your description of the loose rocks and dirt was accurate.   We parked at the gravel parking area just south of mile marker 5 on canyon road, and walked on the golf cart path north till we turned east to head up the trail.  As was mentioned in an earlier post at times we weren't exactly sure if we were on the trail or not - just stick near the ridge line and you'll be ok.  The views down into AF canyon were great.  Our phone showed an elevation gain of nearly 4,000 feet and total round trip of 6.4 miles- I'm not sure why the discrepancies.  FYI, there is somewhat of a false summit when you are working through the pines and bark trail, it feels like you must be hitting the north peak summit when you get there, but once you come out there's a few hundred more yards of easy walking to reach the top.  Beautiful views of the surrounding mountains, and the valley between the east slope of Mahogany and Timp is green and beautiful - almost felt like we were in the northwest  : )   Definitely steep and was tough on this old man's feet and legs on the way down through the steeper sections, I've never used poles but the descent made me want 'em..glad we're done..."
14,2017-09-17,['hiking'],"This beta is really off.  Elevation is about perfect but it's closer to 6miles round trip door-to-door.  There's a small chain-link gate near where you should park, and a short jaunt near the golf course to get there.  There's a couple gnarly steep sections - a total scree and loose rock fest closer to the beginning, and the very top is chock full of soft dirt and relentless pitch.  We normally have a pretty brisk hiking pace (like 30minute miles on intense trails,) but we finished with an average of 46minute miles for this freaking hike.  I'm glad we did it, since we have to look at it every day, but I will gladly never do it again.  Beautiful views at the top though, no doubt.

Hiking poles HIGHLY recommended and if you bring a dog, make sure it has good discipline to not tempt the ridge too much - ours do not, so we had to have them leashed to us and it slowed things down considerably on the way down to their pulling.  Total RT was just under 4.5 hours, pretty bad."
15,2017-08-20,['hiking'],"The name of this trail is incorrect. It is Canyon Nature Trail. The park staff had not even heard of ""five senses nature trail"".  The path is short and a little uphill but overall nice."
16,2017-06-29,['hiking'],"steep hiking from the start. Beautiful views and flowers. Tall pine area toward top especially pretty and very steep. About 3 hours round trip from golf course. Started at 530am, trail was in the shade the whole time except up on top, it made it very pleasant."
17,2017-06-06,['mountain biking'],"GNARLY!! The trail was way to steep to ride up so I hiked my bike up. I didn't have time for the whole trail, because hiking with my bike takes longer. The ride down was INSANE! It was very technical and it was very scary on some of the turns. It made me nervous riding on the edge a few times. I need new brake pads now..."
18,2017-06-06,[''],Very steep.  i didnt see anyone else on the trail.  There are portions of the trail which provide unobstructed views from the ridge line which are very beautiful.
19,2017-02-19,[''],The map and recorded track is for Mahogany Mountain North Peak not the five senses trail. Five senses is a nice easy walk with kids. Mahogany Mountain North Peak is a relentlessly step difficult trail for experienced hikers. Please don't follow the map expecting this to be the five senses trail. The mahogany Mountain trail gains 3000 feet in 2.5 Miles and has loose shell rock - great views but not a kid friendly trail.
20,2016-11-14,[''],"woo! this trail kicked our butts! we gained 3000 feet in about 2.5 miles the way we went. didn't have time to go to the top though :( word of advice: if you're ever feeling lost, just go back up to the ridge. there's always a main trail there. also heard that you can do this hike from a trailhead in pleasant grove"
21,2016-11-14,['hiking'],"5 miles r/t. Excellent training as its a stair stepper type hike from start to summit.
Beautiful ridge exposure trail nearly the entire time.
2 hrs to summit (85% max heart rate entire time), 1:30 to descend (65% max hr). took a 5 min. break at the top."
22,2016-08-20,['hiking'],"This was a good hike, it was steep enough to get to the top quickly. It is a little difficult to find the trailhead. Go to the end or the golf course loop near the mountain and search for the trail right at the foot of the mountain."
23,2016-05-18,['hiking'],"Relentlessly steep, from start to finish its a good hard one. Trail becomes hard to locate at times but stick close to the ridge and you'll find it. The views on the way up are killer and from the top are just epic, you can see the great salt lake on a clear day!
Bring plenty of water and if possible pick a cool day to do this one on. If you wanna access this trail without crossing the edge of the golf course you have to cut through either the back or the far end. We found a way in with no ""no trespassing"" signs you just have to look."
24,2016-04-30,['hiking'],"I hiked this trail yesterday, it is 3 miles to the summit of Mahogany north peak.   The last mile is the steepest through the big pines. The views only get better the higher you get, into AF canyon, Utah county, Salt lake County. The snow was slushy so additional foot traction is recommended for early spring hiking. My micro spikes were perfect for the mud also. I would recommend treking poles for the way up to be more comfortable and safe."
25,2015-08-04,['hiking'],"Short, easy trail that has information of the local flora and fauna. Best to do this hike in conjunction with other hikes up American Fork Canyon."
26,2015-06-14,[''],lame
27,2015-06-12,['hiking'],"To get to the trailhead, you'll have to walk along the golf cart path.  It's situated just behind one of the greens.  The best place to park would be just off of Canyon Road before mile marker 5.  There's a gravel road that leads to a parking lot of sorts.  You can walk to the trail head from there.  It's best to look at it in satellite view on Google maps.

The trail itself runs right along the ridge of American Fork Canyon so you get nice views into the canyon and of the valley the higher up you get.  The trail is pretty steep and has some difficult parts with loose rock to navigate through so it's not exactly suited for kids, but I suppose that depends on your kids.  I only went half way up the trail before I ran out of light.  Look forward to getting to the top next time."
28,2014-05-15,[''],This is nothing more than a nature trail with some informative signs about the evosystem of AF canyon posted along the way.
