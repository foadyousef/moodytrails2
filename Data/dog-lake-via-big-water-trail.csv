0,2019-09-02,['hiking'],Nice place to take your dog or to hike or to go for a run.  Surface is very soft and non technical. Just don't expect spectacular views because there are almost none.
1,2019-08-31,['hiking'],"nice hike. way too many bikers who don't respect hikers. just about got hit twice by bikers racing down fast.  took 1hr20 minutes w a 35lbs pack.  nice views, no wildlife.  "
2,2019-08-20,['hiking'],Beautiful gradual climb! Not busy on a Monday early evening. Crazy hard to find parking/busy on weekends. Shaded and cool. Lots of dogs of odd calendar days! My path was about 6 miles.

4,2019-08-08,['hiking'],Went yesterday when it was overcast and rainy.  It was perfect.  The wildflowers are absolutely amazing.  We left from lower big water trailhead and it was 7 miles exactly.  Pups were happy and worn out.  Would definitely recommend!
5,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"Very beautiful trail, but horrible for a big group!! A lot of  bikers."
6,2019-08-04,['hiking'],super busy but relatively easy hike
7,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"You can access this trail from Big or Little Water Trails. Up and back from Little Water is only about 4 miles, though the first 3/4 of the way up is pretty steep but mostly shaded and the river runs alongside it for part of the time. Most of the trail is shaded and really pretty with wildflowers throughout. The lake is small but prettier than I expected and always filled with cute pups. Would definitely recommend this hike. "
8,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs']","beautiful hike in my opinion. nice views, pretty colorful wild flowers, passing by a stream through 3 different bridges. very relaxing. my 7yo and 14yo did well. and they are big complainers normally :)
the lake itself was ok. I was expecting ""bigger ending"". bur dogs love it. there is a lot of them. on odd days bikes are not allowed and dogs can be off leash. on even days bikes are allowed and dogs have to be leashed. we went 7/27 and majority of dogs were off leash. makes me little nervous because our puppy is not used to so much dog activity around her. we had her on leash and everything went well until the lake where owner was nowhere to be found and one of the dogs started attacking our pup. luckily we were able to get ours to safety. I was however impressed how many well behaved dogs are out there following their owners. I hope my dog will one day too :) parking is bad. very little spots. we had to circle and wait for someone leave. "

10,2019-07-18,['hiking'],"It’s not the most beautiful lake, but it is great for getting out with your pup! The wildflowers are in bloom at the moment but probably won’t last much longer....we’ll probably have another week or so to enjoy them"
11,2019-07-18,['hiking'],"Pretty drive up to the trail head, but the trail itself is loose dirt and dusty. There's also far too much bike traffic to be enjoyable having to always watch out from being ran over. Glad I did it, but won't do again."
12,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Absolutely love this trail! I did this today and the trail was lovely. There are a lot of bikes that use the trail on even-numbered days, so be aware of that if you go with your pup. Great gradual grade."
13,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"We got there early.  Like 7AM and there was zero parking. We got lucky and snagged a spot. The hike was gorgeous. It was overcast and not too hot.  As the morning went on, there was more and more traffic.   I’d recommend an early morning hike.  But we (the dogs and myself) enjoyed ourselves immensely.  "
14,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"Best trail in the valley to take dogs off leash (odd number days). It’s a blast - lots of water stops and the lake to swim. 
"
15,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"Tons of people and even more dogs.  Got to the lake about 8am, I love dogs but was not prepared for 10 dogs barking non-stop, echoing in the valley...kinda sucked.
HOWEVER if you are a dog owner this is the perfect off leash hike."
16,2019-07-08,['hiking'],"One of my goto dawn patrol trails once the winter gate is open (July 1st). You won't see many (ANY) people if you are up there at 5AM. Whether running or biking it's always a good workout. When you get to the lake, continue on around the lake (go left) and you will see some great camping options above the lake as well as some other trail options if you want a longer trek. If you are on a bike, make sure you don't go down the trail too fast as there are frequently dogs (and small children) off leash to watch out for (especially around the corners)."
17,2019-07-08,['mountain biking'],Beautiful trail. Mostly shady. Very few rocky spots. Very few exposed (steep on both sides) spots. Unless you have a dog the second half and the destination (Dog Lake) is a little disappointing. Today I continued on Great Western about 4k instead. Much more interesting. Good beginner bike trail. A little steep near the end. 
18,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"This trail is gorgeous and beautifully shaded in the morning. Beautiful views, wildflowers, rushing water, aspens, and friendly people and lots and lots of dogs. The lake is not a pretty one but it is still a beautiful setting and the vibe is great with all the happy pups. This trail is a continuous steady incline with no breaks and provides a solid workout. "
19,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"(the gate through millcreek was closed so we went through big cottonwood canyon ""mill d north"") My friend and I did this trail yesterday. It was really beautiful the entire way up. Being slighty out of shape and going at a time where it was mostly in the sun it was fairly difficult. once we got to the lake we kicked off our shoes and dipped our feet in for a few minutes to find a bunch of leaches on our feet when we pulled them out. Once we got back to the car we realized we had lost the keys somewhere along the way AND HAD TO DO THE ENTIRE HIKE A SECOND TIME! Only to be told towards the top someone had found and hung them at the bottom on one of the signs. Overall it was a learning experience in a truly gorgeous place that neither of us will forget. I would definitely do this hike again in the evening and practice being less impulsive and more mindful next time hahaha."
20,2019-06-29,['trail running'],"Started at Winter gate in Millcreek.  Proceeded beyond Dog to Desolation lake on the newish cutover trail.  The named trail is pretty easy, not to steep at all (except near the start).  No more snow until you get to Desolation.  Saw 10`-15 people even though it's 5 miles just to get to the trailhead when the gate is closed.  Good day to do the trail. Gate opens July 1 typically. "
21,2019-05-18,['hiking'],
22,2018-10-25,[''],"I love this hike. FYI, Winter gate is already up for the season (they closed it prior to Nov. 1 this year). If you want to do this one from the starting point shown here, you'll need to road walk 4.5 miles to get to the trailhead after parking at the picnic area in front of the Winter gate, yikes. Or you could get to it from Big Cottonwood instead, but no dogs allowed on that side."
23,2018-10-12,['hiking'],We hiked in the afternoon. There was quite a bit of the trail in the sun not as shaded as I would have preferred.
24,2018-09-27,[''],Very well maintained trail.  Lots of beautiful colors going into the fall.  Plenty of water for dogs.  I didn’t really notice any poop along the trail except people would leave it on the ground in a baggy to pick up on the way back.  Nice gradual incline.  Overall my dog loved it so that’s all that matters
25,2018-09-18,['trail running'],"As billed, busy and lots of cute puppies along the way, but beautiful Fall colors and the weather was perfect. Pretty easy hike/run all in all."
26,2018-08-26,['hiking'],I really enjoyed this hike! Not too strenuous. Quite a bit of the trail is shaded and there are a couple of streams for the dogs to drink out of on the way up. Lots of dogs and people but that’s what it’s all about! My dogs loved the lake!
27,2018-08-05,['hiking'],Great workout on the way up to lake. Shaded mostly with steady incline.
28,2018-08-02,[''],"I love, love, love this trail! The flowers are fading, but the beautiful forest setting is reason enough to take this hike. I love making a loop out of this trail by hiking to Dog Lake via Big Water, but coming down via Little Water. The flowers in Little Water were still very much in bloom when I last hiked it on July 29."
29,2018-07-26,['hiking'],Great trail that will give you a nice workout. The wild flowers are out now and give a nice added touch of color to the mountain trail. Dog Lake is more of a big pond and not as picturesque as other mountain lakes I've hiked to and it's rightly named: lots of playful pups enjoying the hike. Hop the trail on even days if you'd prefer a hike without dodging dogs and their droppings.
30,2018-07-18,[''],Nice gradual incline. One of my favorite Millcreek hikes. Especially great if you have a pup!
31,2018-07-15,[''],"Did this going up to Dog Lake and did Little the last .5 miles down. It was a great hike, nice and cool. BUT for the love people: clean up after your dogs. Bag the poo and take the poo out."
32,2018-07-10,['hiking'],"Surprisingly steep, short distance at 1.8 miles. HOT on 2:30 pm on July odd day afternoon.
Lots of dogs but no bikes. Some shade throughout the trail. No sweeping vistas at the top. Nice views of surrounding peaks near the lake."
33,2018-07-10,['hiking'],"First I hiked to Lake Desolation and there is a second tail on the way down which takes you to Dog Lake. I decided to go on it because I was already there- Might as well. I’m so glad I did. NOT because it was nice, but because it was an underwhelming, small muddy pond. The two stars are for the wildflowers and butterflies, otherwise it would be a 1 Star."
34,2018-07-08,['hiking'],Ok Hike. Not my favorite. Very few vistas of beautiful scenery. Lots of bikers. Many dogs have left fecal piles in the middle of the trails and owners obviously haven't the courtesy to pick them up. Dusty trail and Dog Lake is very anticlimactic.
35,2018-07-08,['hiking'],such a fun trail.  Its easy we went at 6 am on a sunday and only saw a couple other hikers. the lake is really pretty got awesome pictures. Also got to see a woodpecker and some deer.
36,2018-07-03,[''],"Just wanted to post this to warn others with dogs. There have been reports of dogs falling violently ill after swimming or being up at dog lake. They aren’t sure of the cause, but I wanted to warn people. There’s an article on KSL with more information."
37,2018-06-29,[''],This is 100% go to hike on odd number days with our Silver Lab. It is a great hike for dogs (off leash on odd days) and humans. Trail is very clear and beautiful with wildflowers and the end takes you to a beautiful lake.
38,2018-06-18,[''],Perfect trail if you only have a few hours in your day to hike. Scenic rewards and a beautiful lake to visit.
39,2018-06-11,['mountain biking'],"Killer climb, but epic downhill"
40,2018-06-08,[''],"Started at butler fork, the first leg of the hike is kind of step. Made it to the lake and didn’t see a single soul, it was absolutely beautiful. Came down through mill a Basin, to finish it off. Definitely a great hike."
41,2018-06-03,[''],"Gate is still closed half way up Millcreek, opens July 1st, unable to get to this trailhead till then"
42,2018-05-09,[''],Did this yesterday. Last half snow about 2-3 feet all the way to the lake.  still doable in just hiking boots.
43,2017-10-07,[''],Beautiful easy hike. Super muddy today.
44,2017-10-06,[''],"There are two ways up from the parking lot. Make sure you take the one on the right, it's longer in distance but has less snow and isn't steep. The trail on the left is steep, icy and snowy (and very beautiful.) Great hike in the fall!"
45,2017-09-30,['hiking'],"Great shady trail. Just completed this today (September 29th) and the trail was very muddy/slushy and snowpacked in some places. There are actually a few trails to get up to Dog Park. Dogs absolutely love this trail though, especially if they are water dogs because of the lake. Parking can a little crazy and you might have to deal with angry people looking for a parking space."
46,2017-09-22,['hiking'],This trail is so beautiful in the fall time!
47,2017-09-20,['hiking'],Fun hike with the dogs!
48,2017-09-20,['hiking'],My dog and I very much enjoyed the hike today!
49,2017-09-18,['hiking'],Great hike. Gradual incline. Coverage from the sun is a great plus in the summer. a little chilly this time of year so dress accordingly.
50,2017-09-16,['hiking'],"Great trail. Decided to this one because a moose was blocking one of the other ones, dogs loved the lake at the top"
51,2017-09-11,[''],Enjoyed the shaded trail & depth of the pines!
52,2017-09-10,[''],Nice forrested hike. Not very steep and well covered.
53,2017-09-06,['hiking'],"Excellent hike. I. started the hike at about 3 PM wondering how long it would take to get to the lake with my little Boston terrier. Another fellow hiker informed me that if I took the steeper trail I could get there faster in and out in about 2.5 hours. That is what I did. The hike was a lot steeper than I imagined, it was quite the work out. My dog loved it and so did I, we have been back twice already.

Tips: Dogs off leash on odd days only; $3 park fee upon exit; they accept cash and credit cards."
54,2017-09-04,['hiking'],The trail was well maintained trail.  Consistent inclines all the way hiking up.    The nature around was vibrant greens with tons of wild flowers.  The trail took us about a three hour round trip including a picnic at the lake.  Will be back in a month when the leaves start to change for fall.  
55,2017-09-01,['hiking'],Awesome trail and my dog loved it!
56,2017-08-30,[''],Did this hike at 7am- we encountered 3 moose. The lake was nice for the dogs .
57,2017-08-28,['hiking'],Great little hike
58,2017-08-27,['hiking'],"It was a nice trail. Unfortunately, dog owners of SLC are holed into one canyon and it gets super busy.. I went at 07:30 on Sunday morning. Not terrible on the way up, but overflow was FULL as I left around 08:45. We had a nice time, but someone brought their dog that shouldn't be out on the trails. We were literally at the trailhead, about to jump back in the car, when this dog (on-leash, but not being held)  lunged at one of my dogs, grabbing his neck.. my first one got away, then the other one (right behind him) was immediately attacked and pinned to the ground. Please, dog owners, do not bring your dog if there's question about how they'll behave on the trail. Fortunately, no physical damage was done. But, I've already been through so much with one of my dogs.. An event like that can affect how they react to strange dogs in the future. I want my guys to have fun and feel safe on our trails. Please, please, please - use common sense when planning your dog-inclusive activities."
59,2017-08-24,['hiking'],"Best trail to take your dogs on, especially
If they love to swim. Get's really busy in the summer on weekends."
60,2017-08-16,[''],Such a pretty hike! Lots of cute puppies!
61,2017-08-08,['hiking'],Beautiful soft trails and scenery and the dogs love it on odd numbered days.
62,2017-08-05,['hiking'],"Great trail to hike when summer temps are up.  There's shade & wide trails which make for nice small group hiking.  There are switchbacks, wildflowers, and the occasional moose.  In my experience, the higher elevation makes rattlesnakes a non-issue (I've never seen any here but as always, use care when hiking anywhere in UT as we do have them here) in contrast to hikes in this canyon at lower elevations.  This is an outstanding hike to take with a friend for a picnic at the lake.  Be sure to bring extra layers & a rain jacket in case of a t-storm as the weather can change rapidly & temps are significantly cooler than in the valley.  Headlamps make this a fun night hike, just be sure to check the closing time on the lot if you park in it as the gate closes around 10:00pm."
63,2017-07-30,['hiking'],Loved the Hike very easy to do.
64,2017-07-29,[''],"loved it.  Heavily used for biking, next time I will go on an odd day because bikers are only allowed on even days"
65,2017-07-27,[''],The hike was beautiful. There was quite a bit of shade and the bikers on the trail were very considerate. We started from  the lower trail and according to the sign at the lake it was 3.3 miles there and back. I loved having dogs on the trail. Sadly the owners are not all responsible about packing out their waste which was frustrating. We were fortunate to see a moose and her baby in one of the meadows. There were a lot of bugs (mostly flies). The lake isn't very big and the view is okay but the journey had some spectacular views.k
66,2017-07-26,[''],Go on an odd day if you want to avoid mountain bikers and so your dog can roam free.
67,2017-07-25,[''],Great hike today!
68,2017-07-23,[''],Great for dogs and kids.
69,2017-07-17,[''],we love this trail on odd days so our dogs can be off leash.
70,2017-07-16,[''],Love this trail! Beautiful!
71,2017-07-16,[''],Ran as part of wasatch 100 training. Nice trail.
72,2017-07-14,['hiking'],
73,2017-07-11,['hiking'],
74,2017-07-10,['hiking'],"Beautiful area with plenty of shade and high enough altitude to escape the intense summer heat in the valley. One of the most lush trails I've done in Utah. Went up Big Water Trail (longer but fewer steep inclines) and down Little Water Trail (steep but a mile shorter to get back to trailhead). For someone not in amazing physical shape, I recommend that routing."
75,2017-07-09,['hiking'],"Beautiful wild flowers! Make sure you pay attention to the signs, or you might end up hiking 10 miles!! Still super fun and beautiful!"
76,2017-07-08,[''],"Loved this hike! Wild
Flowers, wild life, just beautiful scenery."
77,2017-07-08,['hiking'],"Great hike...not difficult. Lots of people though...and of course lots of dogs. Parking lots were full, had to park half mile down the canyon...on a friday morning."
78,2017-07-05,[''],Loved it!! Great to have the dog off leash! The dogs loved to play with each other at the lake!
79,2017-07-04,['hiking'],"Great hike best to go on an odd day to avoid bikers, but it was a great hike in all. Had an awesome time."
80,2017-07-03,[''],Beautiful. Last stretch was tough but worth it.
81,2017-07-03,[''],"Great trail, try odd days then your dog will be unleash. 
Heavy traffic"
82,2017-07-01,['hiking'],"Great trail. Fairly well maintained. Gate to get to the trail head opens up today, 7/1. Took my dog on it today and she loved it, she even took a dip in the lake and played with all the other pups up there. This is a moderate/easy trail, with only some small steeps to climb. It's fairly long, so bring water, but also nicely shaded to help keep you cool. Lots of single track. Do it on an odd numbered day so you don't have to deal with MTB'ers. Watch out for off leash dogs that aren't well behaved, some dog owners have a bit too much faith in their ""good girl/boy"". Parking is tight and the $3 per car fee to get up means you should carpool if you can."
83,2017-06-25,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. There were planets of shaded areas and the lake was quiet.
84,2017-06-25,['hiking'],
85,2017-06-23,['hiking'],Hike to Dog Lake yesterday from Mill D/Big Cottonwood.  No snow on the ground or trail.  Wildflowers starting to appear along the trail and in the meadows.  Lake was quiet with no one around in the morning.
86,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Hiked to Dog Lake today with my son and wife. Wildflowers were growing many places along the trail. Pin leaf penstemon, Indian paint brush, regular penstemon, Queen Anne's Lace, and others wildflowers. Lots of shade throughout the hike. Very pretty about half way up as you hike through the aspen forest and along the stream. Lake itself was very pretty today and only a few people up there. Enjoyed the hike very much but the last uphill push to the lake wore me out since I was carrying about 40lbs with my son in a backpack. Family friendly hike and lots to see along the way. Worth hiking!"
87,2017-06-17,[''],"amazing trail..
and found a moose in my way down hill they are huge!"
88,2017-05-29,['hiking'],18 of us made the trip today including 11 kids as little as age 7.  Last half mile was all snow packed trail but you can still make the lake with some effort!!  Trees have not budded for new leaves yet on the upper half but this hike should be pretty spectacular by mid June. Always a great hike to a destination and sure beats the traffic on the other side of the road to donut falls. Enjoy!
89,2017-05-29,[''],"Good trail. A lot of trees are still missing leaves and the Lake still has some ice on it. I can imagine mid summer it is beautiful. About 2 miles in you'll come to a fork and from there the rest of the trail is still covered in snow, so be prepared."
90,2017-05-24,[''],Did this on may 22. there was still plenty of snow for about 3/4's or maybe half of the hike. the lake was still frozen and a lot of the trees don't have their leaves yet. I bet this is a gorgeous hike a little later in the summer or fall. Will have to try it again. It seemed shorter than five miles to me.
91,2017-04-20,['hiking'],"Made it to the lake, the last mile was snow packed."
92,2017-04-19,[''],"Did all but the last bit of this hike yesterday. 
Most of the trail is still in feet of snow but I was able to follow a moose trail most of the way up.  Didn't go the last ways down the side of the mountain to lower down to the lake because the snow was past my waist. 
Wild life is super active this time of year, with so few people around... ran into a moose almost literally and saw fresh mountain lion tracks.  
Be careful around the portion of the trail that wraps by the stream, it's hard to tell exactly were the water is and I feel through the snow into the stream once."
93,2016-11-14,[''],Not a hard hike. Very beautiful and the end is super pretty especially in the fall when the colors are changing. My dog loves to play in the water so that alone makes it worthwhile.
94,2016-11-02,['trail running'],Awesome trail run to a beautiful little lake. I love being able to let my dog off the leash to run with me.  Go early so you can get a good parking spot.
95,2016-11-02,['hiking'],"Went on this hike 4 days ago and it was great. It was so beautiful! There are quite a few trails off of this one, so you really could explore for quite a while if you wanted. If you don't like dogs, this is not the hike for you. Also, my GPS watch only clocked this as 4 miles total."
96,2016-10-31,['hiking'],"This hike is a favorite.  It is beautiful throughout, especially in the fall with all the trees.  The incline is gradual.  My dog enjoyed the lake at the end very much and made friends with lots of other dogs up there.  Beautiful views on this hike.  I will do it again for sure."
97,2016-10-24,['hiking'],
98,2016-10-10,['backpacking'],"This is a very great fall hike!! The scenery includes pockets of pine between some Aspen trees! 

I liked this hike because the trail starts with a pretty steady incline with flat parts that serve as a great breaks that help you keep a steady pace! 

PS. Moose are around this trail. If you're lucky and see them around, just admire at a distance. they're pretty used to people but just be safe."
99,2016-10-01,[''],Dogs! Thank you chihuahua owner for providing me with a hardy laugh bringing your tiny dog on a 10km hike. The little dog that could!
100,2016-09-29,['hiking'],Dog Lake is such a cool surprise to reach at the end of this trail! There's plenty of room for everyone on days when there are more people. We enjoyed picnicking and gawking at the beautiful scenery while watching our doggies splash around in the water.
101,2016-09-13,['hiking'],"This is a really lovely, fairly easy trail.  The surface is very soft dirt/pine needles, most of it is well shaded, and the grade is never steep.  The trail shown on the map is (mostly) the ""Big Water"" trail, if you want an easier grade at the top go straight at the last intersection to remain on Big Water and take the longer but easier route.  For a nice loop, go down via Little Water, which is somewhat steeper and shorter but equally nice.  If you'd like to add a bit of challenge and nice views at the end (overall this hike does not rank well for views, that's the tradeoff of being in shade), climb from the saddle just before dog lake up to the little rise W of Little Water Peak, or go all the way up to Little Water Peak.  Beautiful views of the surrounding area, but there isn't really much trail (and don't believe the map that has a trail down from Little Water Peak to the GWT, it doesn't exist.)"
102,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"nice trail, lots of climbing right at the beginning, and steep for the last half mile before getting to the lake. watch out for mountain bike traffic."
103,2016-09-04,[''],A nice and easy out and back that my pooch loved. Very few hikers without dogs. Kid friendly.
104,2016-08-29,[''],"Love this trail, moderate incline, great for pedaling"
105,2016-08-25,[''],took little water up and big water down. fun trail with lots of dogs. took me 2 hours
106,2016-08-24,[''],Snowy!  Mountain bikers.
107,2016-08-21,['hiking'],"It's a great hike, but on even numbered days there are a lot of mountain bikers coming down the trail that don't know trail etiquette and right of way."
108,2016-08-20,['hiking'],Love this hike!  Someone needs to update this site though.  Dogs are allowed off leash on odd days.  Bikes are allowed on even days.  I love seeing all the dogs on odd days but if you are not into dogs this may not be your trail since even days they allow mountain bikes which isn't all that great to share the narrow trail with the bikers.
109,2016-08-18,['hiking'],"It's worth it to see all the Dogs in their Glory, our Great Dane loves this hike, it is well-shaded and the incline is steady, great quick morning hike"
110,2016-08-17,['trail running'],loved this trail! took my pup along and she loved the lake at the top and the creek crossings
111,2016-08-14,['hiking'],Great trail- my dogs loved the lake.
112,2016-08-07,[''],Great doggie trail..love the trees
113,2016-08-01,['hiking'],Trail is well-maintained and very shady. Spent a good deal of time dodging mountain bikes. The lake was a bit of a disappointment. Wore insect repellent on advice of post here--glad we did. Parking was an issue. Would definitely return with our bikes.
114,2016-07-24,['hiking'],"July 24 2016 It appears there are multiple ways to get to Dog Lake from the parking lot at the top of Millcreek Canyon. We took the Little Water trail up which had very nice scenery and follows a creek up for the first half of it. The grade was a little steeper than anticipated, I would say it's the higher end of a moderate hike. My GPS said it took us about 1.5 miles and 45 minutes of motion time to get up... that doesn't include 4-5 breaks to catch our breath and take a drink of water. The signs said the distance was more like 1.8 miles. 

We were there on an even numbered day so there were some bikers coming down, but they were polite. There were lots of dogs on the trail and up at the lake, it was fun to see them having a good time. It took us 35 minutes to come down back to the parking lot the same way we went up. 

Side note: LOTS of bugs/flies/mosquitos, they'd leave me alone while I was moving for the most part and I wasn't wearing any spray. Very annoying."
115,2016-07-22,['hiking'],"Did this last year.  Few bugs, a couple bikers but friendly.  I'd like to do it again in autumn when the colors change."
116,2016-07-18,['hiking'],Pretty cool hike. I enjoyed the scenery and cooling my feet off in the stream for a bit. I believe the part I started at was called Little Water and then I took that to Dog Lake. Slight incline the whole way but it was still relatively easy. The lake looked pretty gross but my dog still enjoyed jumping in. Definitely wouldn't recommend people going in though...
117,2016-07-13,[''],"Great trail to do with my dog. Pretty easy but lovely scenery, and it's fun to watch all the dogs swimming around in the lake."
118,2016-07-12,[''],"This trail was probably the best I've done so far! There are so many wild flowers and the lake was perfect for the dogs. The lake was smaller than it looks in pictures, but still nice. Parking is a little tight, but we got lucky and were able to park at the trail entrance. Definitely worth doing."
119,2016-07-11,['hiking'],
120,2016-07-10,[''],"This is definitely a trail to take only if you have dogs. Otherwise, you'll be very disappointed by the lake. Lots of bugs this time of year so bring bug spray!"
121,2016-07-07,['hiking'],"This hike is a dog lovers/owners dream! It's long but feels relatively easy as you don't gain a ton of elevation. Our ridgeback and our goldendoodle both love it. It's a pretty trail that offers a lot of beautiful views and shady patches. Millcreek is so quiet and peaceful. I always enjoy hiking there. The actual lake isn't much to look at, but dogs sure love playing and swimming in it."
122,2016-07-04,['hiking'],This trail is long but if you go around 9am it's very cool and shaded most part. Very easy dog friendly and toddler friendly.parking is a bit little problem get there early or you will be driving up and down to get parking and hike a mile before you get to trail head
123,2016-07-04,['hiking'],Drive all the way to the end of Millcreek canyon and park in the parking lot and take the trail that says little water. You eventually see well marked signs for Dog Lake. Well shaded and slightly uphill. Dogs love to jump in the lake. Will do it again.
124,2016-07-01,['hiking'],"First time I did this hike I thought I was going to die. Very steep, but mostly shaded. The lake itself isn't really too exciting (maybe I didn't go the right time of year?) but the dogs love it and the trail is gorgeous. Last time I saw a HUGE moose in a little field just below the trail"
125,2016-06-29,[''],Took a wrong turn at Donut Falls and ended up here! Pleasantly surprised. A little steep but not bad. Tiny lake. I'd love to come camp up here for a weekend and do every trail up here because there's a ton and meet up at Dog Lake it looks like and I unfortunately don't have time today. Will do again 
126,2016-06-19,['hiking'],"Hike was very steep, almost up hill the whole way. Would not suggest for young kids."
127,2016-06-15,['hiking'],"Very fun, classic Wasatch Mountains hike or biking trail."
128,2016-06-14,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery anytime of day. Fun for all ages. Take pictures!
129,2016-06-09,['hiking'],"We did this hike in mid-May so there was still a LOT of snow on the ground. So if you do this hike in early spring bring yaktrax or something similar. Overall it was still an enjoyable hike, although reaching the actual lake was a bit anti-climactic since it was completely frozen over still. Because of all the snow, I would say that the hike is a bit more difficult than it otherwise would be in the summer months.

Side note/mini rant: PLEASE STOP CARVING INTO THE ASPENS! It's not cute, funny, or amusing. You're damaging and destroying them. You're basically treating the tree like a 6th grade bathroom stall. Grow up.

130,2016-06-06,['hiking'],Nice Hike!
131,2016-06-05,[''],"The gate is still closed so we never got to dog lake, but it was a nice walk from the closed gate to the trail head."
132,2016-06-05,['hiking'],"This was an excellent hike to start out the year, beautiful and not to busy. A few patches of snow but they never even got in the way!"
133,2016-06-03,['hiking'],we went there for hiking yesterday.  from the Butler fork trail head after hiking for almost 2 miles we were lost. there was no further way to dog lake. we tried finding a way through the trees but at one point we thought we might get lost there. it was almost 7:15 at that time so we decided to come back. it was confusing. may be next time we will try from another trail head but i am so determine to hike up there. so i am going back again for sure!
134,2016-06-03,['hiking'],"I saw Dog Lake from Big Cottonwood Canyon's Mill D North trail. You cannot have your dog with you since it's a watershed. 

Went up 5/30/16 and it was my first time hiking there. Still snow on the trails but it wasn't that bad to go through/around it. On the way down is a bit scary since I just had trainers on (no tread on the bottom)...but there are sticks everywhere you can use for walking sticks. Fun to run on the way down when the snow on the trails clear!"
135,2016-05-23,['hiking'],Good trail.  Not well marked when we hiked today and we hiked up for over 3 hours and never found the lake 
136,2016-05-13,[''],"I really like this place. The walk up isn't bad at all with full gear and there are lots of hills around the lake to have privacy. The deal with dogs is this: Dog lake and points west are allowed to have dogs on leashes. About a few hundred feet east of Dog Lake the protected watershed begins and you will get hugely massively busted for having a dog there at all. This would seem to indicate that with a dog you cannot go up the southern trailhead because it is in Millcreek (I wouldn't anyway because of the steep ledges there - also this is the only point of access until July) and must enter from the north, on a leash and using baggies and you must not venture east of the lake."
137,2016-05-04,['hiking'],This was a very easy hike with both my little brothers (5 & 6) and dogs. Make sure to bring water and some snacks if you have kids with you. It would also be a good idea to bring a towel if your going to let your dog go in the water.
138,2016-04-09,['hiking'],"Great hike, done many times. Pack water for yourself and dogs."
139,2016-03-21,[''],"If you are hiking to just get a great view of a lake, this is meh. BUT if you have a dog, I can see how this would be an amazing hike for them."
140,2016-03-19,[''],Hiked it in mid March and did not need snow shoe up to about last 0.5 mile . Overall it is easy one in summer and moderate one in winter
141,2015-11-18,[''],"Review from hike in August of 2015:

DO NOT BRING YOUR DOG. My dog immediately became ill after retrieving a toy from the water and throughout the night proceeded to get worse. He is ok now but we were really scared at the time. I don't want to speculate but I believe it to be some type of neurotoxin on the surface of the water (perhaps blue/green algae). Average hike at best, and potentially deadly consequences for your pooch. I would give ZERO stars if possible."
142,2015-10-26,[''],Not  worth the hike ...!
143,2015-10-24,['hiking'],"So, this is a little confusing at the trail head. There is no trail marked Dog lake trail....
There are two trails that go to Dog lake.
1. Little water trail, about 1.8 miles.
2. Big water trail, about 2.3 miles.
Big water trail is the more gentle and is more scenic, with views.
Very nice hike - we went up Little water and down Big water.
Trail is very even and shaded. Also, if you don't like mountain bikers, make sure you go on an ODD number day."
144,2015-10-07,[''],"The hike itself was beautiful, though the lake was rather low. It was a nice, easy trail though! The only thing was having to move over for mountain bikers quite often so be sure to be aware of that if you go!"
145,2015-10-05,['hiking'],"It was a nice starter hike.  I am roughly 300 lbs so if I could do it you can too.   The lake isn't really a lake, its more of a pond."
146,2015-09-30,['hiking'],"Beautiful fall hike, leaves look great right now. Lots of mountain bikers but wasn't a big deal."
147,2015-09-27,[''],"Three girls and seven dogs may be overwhelming to most hikers, my friends and I love hiking and are trying out most of the trails in our valley. 
This one was particularly gorgeous and I over packed. So was difficult uphill for me. The dogs loved the lake and the ones that didn't enjoyed the dirt and long grass. Not convenient for parking but a good hike for people's and dogs."
148,2015-09-25,['hiking'],"Beautiful, hiked Dog Lake for the first time yesterday. The leaves are starting to change as you gain elevation, which was beautiful. Completed the hike in around 3 hours -- this included hanging out at the lake for a bit while my dog played and swam."
149,2015-09-22,[''],Nice easy trail up through forest to Dog Lake. Will be gray in a couple weeks when leaves really turn.
150,2015-09-21,[''],"Good climbing hike with lots of trees and even a good sized stream along the start. Be nice to the dogs, sometimes off-leash...blame the owners."
151,2015-09-15,[''],"very dog friendly, on odd days dogs can be off leash."
152,2015-09-13,[''],"Wore the pup out! It was a pretty hard uphill hike for someone out of shape like me, but it was down hill all the way back! Rewarding hike and beautiful."
153,2015-09-09,['hiking'],Snow shoed this last winter. A quick and scenic hike. A good one to get in after work during the week.
154,2015-09-09,['camping'],"Gorgeous hike the whole way up! I went backpacking up there and the whole way up is gorgeous and fun. Fairly easy to find a place to camp too, loved the surrounding trees and fields. Very scenic and I would definitely do it again!"
155,2015-09-06,['hiking'],I did this trail in about 3 hours it is a lot harder going up than coming down but that is usual. There were a number of hikers and bikers. The lake is small but it made a great pit stop before heading back down. I think that it would make a better trail in the Fall when the colors are changing there are a lot of aspen in the area.
156,2015-09-06,['hiking'],"It was all up hill, so it seems more than 3 miles going up but going down we did it in 1hr."
157,2015-09-06,['hiking'],Serene and beautiful hike. 3 hrs.
158,2015-09-02,['trail running'],"Smooth and well marked. There are a lot of people and dogs. There are also bikers. Be carefulI.
If you think Dog Lake is not impressive, try Lake Desolation which is about 3 miles away."
159,2015-08-30,['hiking'],"I found the trail head on the Big Cottonwood Canyon side at Mill D. This trail was beautiful, peaceful, shady and even has a few challenging steeps but not many. I had a fun time eating my lunch watching all the dogs play in the lake at the top. I'll definitely do this hike again. I'll try to find the trailhead on the Mill Creek Canyon side and borrow a dog to take with me. Great hike."
160,2015-08-24,[''],My favorite hike so far!!!
161,2015-08-24,['cross country skiing'],Awesome super easy fun to do in a group:)
162,2015-08-16,[''],"First time there. Not too bad, it's a little longer than what my kids are use to but my Red Heeler loved the trail and the lake."
163,2015-08-15,['hiking'],I love this hike and my dog loves it too. Just sucks to remember odd and even days.
164,2015-07-29,[''],"Started up this hike today and made it about .25 miles before we heard a mountain lion in the foliage. We had to turn around.  Thanks to the last reviewer, my guard was up. I am not sure I would have known that sound had it not been for the previous review.  I echo the warning to be careful!!!"
165,2015-07-18,[''],"Awesome trail! My pup loved the lake, there are a lot of cyclists on even # days though."
166,2015-07-16,[''],It is a fairly easy hike to a beautiful lake. The only downfall -  I went at about 10am on a Monday and it was crowded.
167,2015-07-14,[''],It's a nice little lake
168,2015-07-12,['road biking'],"Took the Little Water Trail to Dog Lake. Parking is limited at trail head but there are two over flow parking areas. The trail head is clearly marked. Dogs on leash are allowed on odd days. Cyclist allowed on even days. Trail is clearly marked as there are many different destinations branching off along the Little Water Trail, Dog Lake being one of the options. The path is well maintained and not rocky but is a steady incline. Beautiful trees and flowers and wildlife to be seen. The actual Dog Lake is small but beautiful in the morning with mist rising from the water. This hike is more about the trail journey than the actual lake destination. Enjoyable hike and a trail to return to for other hikes to explore other destination. Total time was about 3 hours but we didn't rush and enjoyed the scenery. Could definitely be done quicker. Recommend morning hike prior to 9am to enjoy having the trail all to yourself."
169,2015-07-12,['trail running'],"It is usually crowded over summer weekends. It would be lucky to find a parking spot nearby. 
The trail is largely shaded. But it is often crowded and there are many dogs around. So it may not be the best for children and those who are not comfortable with dogs. 
The trail is clear of green vegetations, thank largely to bikers."
170,2015-07-10,[''],I took the Bob stroller up! I recommend taking the big lake trail
171,2015-06-29,['hiking'],This is great hike. I've encountered moose both times I've done this week. Lots of mountain bikers. Most of the trail is completely shaded. Perfect getaway on hot days in the valley. The elevation gain isn't bad and Dog Lake at the end is really nice. The steepest part of the hike is the very beginning.
172,2015-06-18,['hiking'],Good for exercise. But the lake is a disappointment. Too crowded.
173,2015-06-14,[''],"this was a fun hike, it's very pretty up there, the hike seemed  to be mainly up hill which was a great workout, and the lake was pretty."
174,2015-06-10,[''],"Great hike this time of year with lots of flowers and new green leaves on the trees. The last part of the hike gets a little tough. And according to the sign, this hike is really 5.2 miles in and out."
175,2015-05-26,[''],Beautiful hike. Dog lake is a nice place for a picnic. We enjoyed hiking this trail as a family
176,2015-05-26,[''],Ran into mountain lion. Be careful on trail. Absolutely beautiful and worth the hike.
177,2015-04-21,['hiking'],"Accessed via Mill d trailhead because gate is closed. Made it pretty far but turned around 0.3 miles before lake due to snow, we were afraid of breaking a leg falling through. Will try again in a month or so."
178,2015-04-20,['hiking'],"Access via Millcreek Canyon Road is closed during winter months.  Wish the overview wouldn't have said accessible year-round.  If I can update this later, I will once I can do the hike, meaning when the gates have opened and we can access it from Millcreek Canyon Road."
179,2014-10-13,['hiking'],"The trail head is way up at the top of Millcreek. Parking can be difficult, but it's a pretty hike and not too crowded. Plus, Dog Lake is a great place to take the pups. They loved it!"
180,2014-09-01,[''],"Beautiful hike, disappointing lake."
181,2014-08-19,[''],I snowshoed up to Dog Lake and had a great time.  Beautiful scenery of aspens and a great work-out.  I saw some people skiing down the opposite way I was snowshoeing up!  The lake was snow-covered so not much to see at the final destination but all-in-all very enjoyable.
182,2014-08-10,['hiking'],Good easy hike.  Obviously great for dogs.  Remember the south side goes into big cottonwood canyon (watershed).  With patience  and persistence this hike can be done by many.  The lake itself isn't amazing compRed to lake Blanche but it's accessibility makes it fantastic.
183,2014-08-02,[''],"Beautiful hike, do not forget bug spray!"
184,2014-07-27,['hiking'],"Dogs and bikes are the busiest users of this trail. Stunning meadows and enclaves on the way up Little Water trail to the lake - enchanting in the summer with wildflowers abound. The lake itself was a bit of a let down as it seemed more stagnant  and  somewhat  swampy - slightly mosquito ridden and sterile. Semi-challenging hike as its mostly all up going, and all down coming back. I thought the journey was more magical than the destination in this case."
185,2014-07-08,[''],Took my kids and they loved the hike

192,2014-02-06,['hiking'],"DOG FRIENDLY
There are two ways in and out of Dog Lake up Millcreek Canyon. The First way, Big Water Trail is much longer than it's counterpart. The incline is significantly more gradual and perfect for the aspiring landscape photographer. We went in mid October and it was gorgeous. (Pictures to Follow) Next, Little Water Trail is shorter and much steeper. It was basically a slip and slide the entire way down. Much of LIttle Water Trail is shaded making for a nice cool trip, but with the snow and ice of October it was a bit unnerving at times. Overall the hike is beautiful, super muddy when rain/snow has hit the area, and nice for a day hike. When you reach Dog Lake, take a load off. It feels anti-climactic until you sit and take it in. At the time of year we went, there was a soft fog rising from the lake surface. Pines in the background were awesome."
193,2013-12-01,['hiking'],Muddy and longer than expected. While we were relaxing at dog lake we heard giant thuds coming through the trees. Turned around and a moose was running at us through the trees. let's just say we ran away
194,2013-09-12,['hiking'],Nice easy to follow trail but very crowded. I prefer hiking to Dog Lake from Big Cottonwood via Mill D.
195,2013-09-01,['hiking'],"I started at big waters trailhead to get to Dog Lake Trail. There is not very much parking as we went on a Saturday. There are other overflow parking places you can park, but it is a nice uphill hike. The road towards the end of Mill Creek becomes very narrow where you will have to share the road.  The hike itself is mostly uphill and flat in many places. This was my first hike up mill creek canyon and when I got to the trailhead, it was hard to breathe but it got easier as we kept going. There are tons of trees so you are always under the shade.  It was raining during our hike, but not enough for mud or any sliding.  The last .2 miles to the lake is rough as it is a steep incline. Once you get to the lake, there are lots if other dogs playing. It says dogs need to be on a leash however, 98% of the dogs on the trail were well mannered. The trail is well maintained and I would do it again. There is a $3.00 parking fee that you have to pay for when you leave the canyon."
196,2013-08-22,['hiking'],Well maintained easy trail to dog lake from millcreek canyon
197,2013-08-20,['hiking'],"Fun, but busy trail.   Great place for your pup to play though.  Just be cautious of the logs floating in the lake, the can roll and hurt your dog.  My pup learned the hard way.  Luckily just a shoulder sprain, but it certainly could have been worse.

Also, don't continue on to desolation lake with your pup unless you want a hefty 300$ fine.  "
198,2013-08-11,['hiking'],Took my husband and puppy up to Dog Lake today. We loved it! It is an extremely scenic hike with a well maintained path. I would recommend to any one going that you choose an ODD numbered day though. The mountain bikers can't use the paths on odd numbered days (we went on the 10th). They are extremely polite (for the most part) but it became tedious having to constantly get off the path to let them by. The lake itself is more like a pond but the scenery was worth it. It is a 6+ mile trek so bring water and something to snack on.
199,2013-08-08,['hiking'],"This hike is near a series of trails at the end of Mill Creek Canyon. Pleasant shady hike near lots of water. A few steep uphill sections, but nothing strenuous. Easy to hike after a day of work. Complete this hike on a dogs day and enjoy a rest while your pup enjoys the trail's namesake. "
200,2013-07-29,['hiking'],Awesome hike! Ran into a mamma and baby moose.. Parties with them on the trail! 
201,2013-07-02,['hiking'],Great hike with good friends! The sounds of nature are everywhere on this hike
202,2013-06-06,['hiking'],Great hike! towards the end there is a pretty long steep hike up but once you get through that the lake is just a little bit further. We saw 2 deer which made my trip! We got there around 8pm and the mosquitoes were pretty bad so maybe try going earlier in the day. Highly recommended!
203,2013-06-03,['hiking'],it was a good hike. Not really six miles.
204,2013-03-12,['snowshoeing'],"Snowshoed from the spruces campground. Moderately steep, but not too bad. Gorgeous with lots of trees, and some descent powder near the lake. The trail splits once after the dog lake/desolation lake fork: stay right, or you'll get into some sketchy terrain. All in all, I'd totally do it again and would love to see it when the snow melts."
205,2012-09-10,['hiking'],"We ascended Butler fork, went to Dog Lake, then Desolation Lake, and descended Beartrap canyon.

A beautiful day and a great hike, but too crowded at Dog Lake.  At one count there were 14 dogs playing around the water!  Other than Dog Lake the trail usage was light.

The leg from Dog Lake to Desolation lake was much less crowded, except for numerous mountain bikers on descent from Guardsman Pass.  We didn't see a soul on the descent in Beartrap canyon.  The first half of the Beartrap descent is relentlessly steep, but still a great time!

We stashed bikes for the ride down Big Cottonwood from the Beartrap Trailhead to Butler Fork Trailhead to complete the loop."
206,2012-09-06,['hiking'],"Great hike, not overly strenuous and great colors in the fall. Check out the attached pics. This trail connects over to Mill Creek.  You can bring your dog from the Mill Creek side, not from the Big Cottonwood side."
207,2012-08-24,['mountain biking'],"Great summer and Fall mountain biking destination. I would bike up Mill Creek, pick up the Great Western Trail and then ride up to Dog Lake. There are several branch trails leading to the back side of Park West, which is a great ride, another into Desolation Lake and another up to the Crest / Ridge trail. But dog lake is great for dogs and bikers and hikers. Good resting point deep in the Wasatch that seems never to dry up (don't know about this year). But I have biked it several times and love going up there."
208,2012-07-28,['hiking'],"There are a couple of different trails you can follow to dog lake. One is longer, but far less steep. If you do the loop counter-clockwise its not a bad hike - but longer. We started by going up the Big Water trail, again, far less steep than going up the Little Water trail, but more distance. We met some folks coming up the Little Water side (as we were coming down that direction) who were pretty discouraged about how difficult it was. The loop took us about 3.5 hours and according to my GPS was about 6.5 miles. I'm not an expert hiker by any means and we were passed by several people trail running. Expect to see plenty of dogs (we got some friendly ribbing as we were about the only people on the trail without a canine buddy), but a beautiful hike!"
209,2012-06-08,['hiking'],"We came a bit early in the season- there was still quite a bit of snow near the lake. But the trail is gorgeous, amazing views, and the lake is breathtaking. Plan on coming back later when the snow is melted."
210,2012-05-29,['hiking'],"This hike was a bit more advanced than I expected, it's mostly uphill the entire way to the lake (after the fork in the path, the rest of the way gets fairly steep), but it's still very pleasant. Some of the trail was muddy this time of year (Memorial Day), but otherwise not very complicated. It was fairly crowded, but not surprising since it was a holiday. Would've rather gone in late summer/early fall, most of the trees were bare and there were some patches of snow here and there. If you're an expert hiker, this is probably an average trail, but if you don't hike that often, this is a perfect challenge and with some very nice scenery."
211,2012-03-09,['hiking'],"From the Park City side, I had trouble getting to the trail head because white pine canyon road is private.  "
212,2012-01-19,['trail running'],"From the Millcreek side this is a good jogging trail - gentle slope until the last 0.3 miles.  Moderately crowded during the summer, it's called Dog Lake for a reason.  Lots of happy pets.  Great fall colors before the rangers close the Millcreek gate above Log Haven.  Less traveled during the winter months with easy access from the Mill D side."
213,2011-11-24,['hiking'],"This is just a good walk in the hills type of hike. Sections will get the heart rate up and other sections it's just an easy stroll. From Mill D is the shortest route. From Butler Fork you get to spend more time near water. From Millcreek canyon you get to spend more time in the shade. From the parking lot in Mill D to where the trail splits and you have the choice of Dog Lake or Desolation Lake. It's an easy, scenic walk. From the split to Dog Lake it gets steep and stays that way until about 100 yards from the lake. Watch for mountain bikers especially in low light conditions. They seem to appear out of no where and disappear just as quickly. Great hike for fall colors."
