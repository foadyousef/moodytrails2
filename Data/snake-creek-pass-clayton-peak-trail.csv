This trail is beautiful and is very quiet compared to going to the lakes. You are hiking through Brighton ski resort so there are service roads you cross, but don't let that deter you. It's a great hike."

Took an alternate route down by hiking north on the ridge line, then down to a nearby lift (watch the cliff) and down the run to some tire tracks which eventually led to a trail. Made for a nice loop.  View from the peak was amazing!"
4,2016-11-07,['hiking'],Trail winds through trees and ski runs up to Snake Creek pass then follows a road to the top of a ski lift. The trail continues after you cross under the lift and climbs steeply up to the ridge that you follow up to Clayton Peak. Great 360 degree views.

The woods are beautiful although the snow made it a little harder to find the trail. We stopped at snake creek pass and had our snacks on some rocks overlooking the best vista. A sign there identified each peak so we knew what web were looking at. We did not continue to Clayton's Peak due to the snow but really enjoyed the hike."
6,2016-08-11,['hiking'],From Brighton it was a 7 mile hike round trip. The views were beautiful and well worth the hike. The trail was easy except for the last .5 miles. The last part is a scramble through rocks to the top.

You cross under the Crest and Snake Creek lifts and end up on  The Western Trail which takes you to Clayton Peak.  We did find the unmarked trail but spent a decent amount of time rock scrambling just because it was fun.  Had lunch at the summit- beware of the biting flies! Then decided to follow the service road and trails down the Great Western side making a full loop. A nice, moderate hike."
8,2015-06-27,[''],Do this hike!!! I was on the trail with 30 people or more until I broke off at Dog Lake and the I was all alone no other hikers. The view from Snake Creek was amazing and then I got to the top of Clayton Peak and a steep scramble and WOW!!! BEAUTIFUL!

You will travel through shaded forest and a couple of meadows. Once you are on the service road near the top,  you can either look for the unmarked trail (there's a cairn), or follow  the service road all the way up to the ski lift and do some boulder hopping to the peak. The unmarked trail is much easier to follow.  Great panoramic views at the top."

We took and ate lunch on top with a group of 5 adults and 7 children. We even carried one in a baby backpack. Instead of making this an out and back we shuttled a car to the top of Guardsman Pass and continued along the ridge line and back to the car. The trail winds through some beautiful trees. The first part of the hike is hot and dusty, but once you hit the cut-off to the peak it is such a beautiful hike. "
