Lots of people on the trail. This was my first time doing this side and it was way prettier than the aspen grove side. No snow to deal with, great wildflowers, saw a moose, and beautiful views!"
1,2019-09-06,['hiking'],"Awesome hike with great scenery and wildlife. Plan on a while, it’s a lot of elevation gain and slow going. 

I wish they’d install some chains at the top of the summit before the shack. It’s a bit scary through there, but other than that it was sick. And I saw a mountain goat. In fact I saw many mountain goats "
2,2019-09-04,['hiking'],"AMAZING! Friend and I got to the parking lot at 8:30 am and nowhere to park. Had to park a down the road making this a 16 mile round tripper. Three  bits of advice: sunscreen, bug spray, and lots of water. Wild flowers are absolutly amazing right now, snow on the trail is very walkable (even without spikes), mountain goats, deer, big horned sheep, and lots of other animals are out this time of year! It is a strenuous hike and the last mile from the saddle to the summit is a steep rocky beast. But very worth it! 

*To the Mountain Momma doing this with a toddler strapped to her back and the pack on her front, you are a rockstar! I barely I got me up that mountain, you were such a motivation! "
3,2019-09-03,['hiking'],"Very nice hike. Labor Day was crowded and parking was a pain. Took the kids, youngest being 9. No problem for them just took some time. After the saddle there is a fair bit of bouldering which is a little taxing with kids in tow but well worth the effort. Beautiful views. Start early. Afternoon heat is unpleasant. My only complaint was the significant ethical violation by way to many millennials with there Bluetooth speakers in pack playing their hideous music. Obviously numb to the environment. YO!!  GET SOME HEADPHONES, if you can’t be without your ridiculous teenybopper music!"
4,2019-09-03,"['hiking', 'scramble']",Hiked 9/1/19. Started at 1:30am and made it to the saddle for sunrise. I would recommend going a little earlier 1am or 12:30am maybe just so you have extra time and not feel too rushed. Also got lost and went to the falls so be careful. There was a sketchy ice patch towards the top but spikes definitely helped. Bring lots of water. I brought 70oz but I would have felt better had I brought another 20oz. It’s about an hour up to summit from the saddle depending on your speed. Seeing the sunrise was worth the effort. 
5,2019-09-03,['hiking'],The flowers are incredible. Hardly any snow. Great!
6,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Super packed trail for Labor Day. Got there at 5:30am and lot was full, so parked at one of the turnouts about 1 mile away. Saw they were ticketing cars parked alongside the road, so make sure to follow the rules. Trail conditions were good, pretty easy hike up, just long. Took me about 3:15 up and 2:15 down. Bring a sweatshirt for the last part on the back of the mountain + summit."
7,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"decent hike.  Sept.2 2019 Labor Day. 
way too many people and dogs!  ridiculous amount of parking problems due to too many people trying to just drive up the canyon and park.  we started trail at 4a.m., reached Timp saddle at 7:10 and continued to the summit and reached summit at 7:50.  ate snacks and breakfast at summit and began descent at 8:30, reached car at 11:40.  then we ran into major traffic jam on the road up to main parking lot "
8,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Beautiful trail and amazing view! I recommend it
9,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Long but beautiful.
Started at 2am, down before 12pm even with slow people in the group.
Recommend getting to the parking lot before 2:45 to get a legal spot."
10,2019-09-01,['hiking'],"This hike lives up to the hype! Got to the trailhead around 5:30am and about half the parking spots were taken already. Getting to the summit took about 3.5hrs; the trail maintains a steady incline, but the real difficulty of this hike is the length—not the grade. In terms of gear, I brought a lightweight pullover, 3L of water, and some food; lots of people had poles, but they aren’t necessary. I ran out of water about 2.5 miles from the trailhead and refilled at one of the numerous spots with flowing water along the descent—make sure to bring a means of filtration or purification. The trail was very busy but not to a point where it was unenjoyable. If you want a hike that has it all (forests, meadows, waterfalls, lakes, wildflowers, snow, etc.) this is it! Will definitely be doing this one again!"
11,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky']",Started at 3:30A and got through the valley just as sunrise started. It was amazing! The flowers are absolutely gorgeous! Summit wasn’t too crowded maybe 3 other groups of 2-5 people. Not too windy or cold (sweatshirt and puffy jacket) Hiked without poles until we started our descend. Super helpful crossing the small snow fields and maneuvering on the rocks coming off of the summit. Worth getting up early for. I wouldn’t do this hike during the middle of the day. Several places aren’t shaded. Coming back very soon! 
12,2019-09-01,['hiking'],Started at 1:30 and got to the peak at 6 to watch the sunrise...along with maybe 50 other people. Busy trail but everyone was friendly so it's nice to see others enjoying the outdoors. 
13,2019-08-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Always amazing
14,2019-08-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Amazing views throughout the hike. Take plenty of water. We saw lots of mountain goats. Super fun hike! There’s still a few spots where we needed to cross snow patches but we did fine without any gear.

17,2019-08-26,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","The review below me complaining about no guard rails and too many rocks cracks me up! My only complaint about this hike is the vast amount of people out there (especially Friday night into Saturday) with zero hiking experience or hiking etiquette. If you’re doubting your abilities to do it, you probably shouldn’t as it is a serious trail with high exposure. If you know how to hike though, don’t doubt yourself. We saw people with sandals , vans, and even crocks that had made it to the summit!  One snow bridge 4miles up requires about 20 steps on a very sturdy snow bridge (poles were helpful), or a quick little climb down to cross the river and climb back up the other side. Both very doable. 
Poles were a great help for crossing snow fields, especially if you plan to go over to emerald lake and then summit from there- the biggest snow fields are from that side just before the saddle. Fine with trail running shoes and poles. 
We hiked with 50lb packs on and made it to emerald lake to camp in about 4.5 hours. Took us another 1.5 to summit from there, 30 minutes to get from the summit to the top of the “glacier”, and 5 minutes to ski back down to emerald lake, then about 3 to get back down to the parking lot. 
If you’re a hiker and know what you’re doing, I recommend hiking on Sunday. About 90% less people do this on Sunday as compared to Saturday. "
18,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"!!!!!IF YOU HAVE A DOG READ THIS!!!!!!!! 

So me and 2 others brought 2 cars. left one at the Aspen trailhead and drove to the Timp. trailhead side. Started hiking at 5:40 am. Finished at 2:17 pm. 19 miles even. We got lost about 1 - 1.5 miles in total. All 3 of us took our dogs. About 4 miles left to the Aspen trailhead all 3 dogs feet started to burn on the sand. The water holes or streams were not enough to over come the hot sand or dirt. I carried my dog on my shoulders about 1 mile. Not once did I feel scared on any of it. No idea what these Mary-Anne's are crying about dangerous crossing. Bunch of Nancy's 

This hike would have been better if we had left the dogs home. 
"
19,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'scramble']","2nd time summiting Timp and it again did not disappoint. Started at 7 am from a turn out about 1.5 miles from the trailhead because it is so busy! Others in our party who arrived at 4:45 am were not able to park in the lot because it was full. If you’re a quick hiker you can easily hit the summit in 4 hours. (We met up with our group who started at 4:45 about 1/2 way up at 8:45) The hike to the saddle is beautiful and covered in wild flowers, moose, & mountain goats. From the saddle to the peak is a Steep, scree filled climb. You walk across the front of the ridge then up a short steep switch back that was extremely overcrowded at noon. Then scramble up to the shack. We stayed on top a while and the traffic cleared out but the wind kicked in around 2 pm. The hike down was nearly empty which was perfect. Left our group behind who were walking and did a trail run down to my car. If you hike down you are about 3-4 hours descent if you run it closer to 2-2.5. Be sure to go to the river and soak your feet in the cold water for a minute to help them not to be sore the next day. "
20,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']",Great summit. So many wildflowers right now. 
21,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'snow']","We hiked this trail overnight to the morning. Our group was 9 people aged 20-24 with a range of experience. To give ourselves extra time we started at 12:30 AM to get to the summit at 6:30 AM for the sunrise. About 1.5 mile in, we came across a moose on the trail right in front of us, which probably took about 20 minutes to wait out. The snow bridge that everyone is talking about in the reviews is definitely gone, so we went down into the chasm a little bit and then climbed back out which was way easier than trying to go up more onto the snow; additionally, the ice fields aren’t bad at all, but having poles was definitely nice and gloves would have been a plus. We met probably a dozen groups at night, and then during the early to late morning we passed probably a hundred people on the way down. Tons of other hikers but since the trail is so long it doesn’t feel crowded. 
Overall, beautiful trail and scenery. We saw 3 moose and 2 mountain goats total which was fun (except for the first moose which we were worried would charge- maybe bring bells on your pack). The only thing about this trail that I really disliked was how ill-maintained it is. Probably 11 of the 14 total miles are covered with rock and shale which is pretty dangerous and at one point one of our group got hit with falling rock and shale from some hikers on a higher switchback. There are also no mile-markers, so try bringing your own GPS or watch. Be aware that after the saddle at the top, there are no guard rails or ropes to hold, so you do have to be pretty careful to not slip on the loose rock all over. For the first few miles or so there are a dozen water crossings, so waterproof boots might be a good call. Beautiful wildflowers, awesome views, and a fun diversity of scenery- but know that this is definitely a strenuous hike. "
22,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","Retuning Hikers:
The snow fields aren't much of a problem anymore. The trail crosses three of them, but they are small enough to go around if you don't feel comfortable walking on the icy fields. The trail seems to have much more rocks then I remember from 2 years ago. 

First Time Hikers:
The sign at the start of the trail says the hike is 9 miles up to the peak. That seems to be more accurate. Plan for 18 miles round trip. 
Parking: if you park not in a stall, you will get a ticket. The lot fills up quickly and there aren't any good options for other parking. The tickets are $60 and they check frequently for cars not in stalls. We got to the lot at 1:50am and there were 5 open stalls.
You will cross about 10 river crossings. There are plenty of stepping stones, but water proof shoes would be a good idea. Be careful on the snow fields. We saw about a dozen people fall and get minor injuries. 
Clothing: Keep in mind that the last 3/4 of the hike goes from the back of the mountain to the front of the mountain. It is almost always very windy and cold. Most days you will experience about a 20 degree drop in temperature. Pack a jacket if you plan to summit. I saw dozens of people returning from the summit shivering and some had large coats. 

Be safe and have a wonderful time! This is an amazing experience!!"
23,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Summited at sunrise. Awesome views. Saw a bunch of wildlife & wild flowers. Popular trail, passed ~200 other hikers. "
24,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"4th time making it up to the shack/ top. we started at 8, got up to the saddle at noon, took a break, and up to the summit. We headed back to the saddle for lunch and down to the car around 5:30 pm. We didn't see any mountain goats today or the moose, which some had seen. there are some snow patches at the top, but are manageable. we used tread/ trail shoes and got across no problem. as always, it's hard but worth every step.
"
25,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Wouldn’t say this trail is difficult, just very long. The wildflowers are spectacular and wildlife (saw 2 moose, Mtn goats, marmots etc) abound. There are a few very easily passable snow patches near the top. Other than that..weather is perfect..get out there! And DONT litter!"
26,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Very doable at this point in the year, which was a relief seeing some of the previous reviews. Started 1:30 AM, summited 6:30 for sunrise, done by noon. I definitely recommend doing sunrise and doing this trail vs. Aspen Grove. Be prepared for wind/cold at the top (it was around 40° for us) and sun (no shade) elsewhere on the trail. Bugs weren't bad at all. Snow is there but won't stop you anymore."
27,2019-08-24,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
28,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"Great hike! Wildflowers will in meadows, Scout Falls still has water and there are water sources on the switchbacks leading up to the saddle. Things to be aware of if you haven’t hiked Timp before, snow fields are still there and are slippery, it’s windy fro the saddle to the summit, don’ miss the small switchbacks leading up to the summit, or you’ll find ourself off the trail. Many camp night at the upper meadow, it’s large enough to accommodate many groups. Bring water or a means to filter and extra food. Lately, bring layers, even if it’s 90 degrees, if you get cold easy, you may want to bundle up if the wind is blowing. Enjoy the hike!"
29,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"Such an incredible hike. The greenery and vegetation is off the charts this year. The snow crossings were plenty manageable, don’t be scared off by some of the recent reviews. Started at 6am, summit at 10am, back to the car at 2pm. This route is way better than Aspen Grove in my opinion — faster, some better views, and don’t have to cross the big rock/snowfield which I feel like adds an hour. Just go do it!"
30,2019-08-23,"['hiking', 'snow']","Beautiful hike, we were sad not to make it to the Summit. We got 2 miles from the top and decided to turn around due to the conditions. The trail was covered in ice and snow which was icy, cracking, and had a decent drop off the cliff if you didn’t make it across. "
31,2019-08-20,['hiking'],"Beautiful! A bunch of us 18 year olds started at 2 am and summited around 6 am, just in time for sunrise. It was a busy Saturday morning so the summit was crowded but beautiful regardless. We didn’t take any spikes or poles for the snow patches and most of us regretted it. Crossing those snow patches in the dead of night meant icy, slippery paths. It wasn’t bad on the way back down, as it has softened up a bit. Other than the ice patches, the trail was great. I would totally recommend starting that early in the morning to watch the sunrise! Totally worth it!"
32,2019-08-19,['trail running'],Beautiful morning to be in a spectacular alpine environment! The snow bridge about 4 miles up has partially collapsed. I watched as a family crossed over blocks of snow in front of me. Only the father could cross it without assistance. A fall would send you down a rocky chasm.  The risk was too great for me and I turned around. Don’t take unnecessary risks out there. 
33,2019-08-19,['hiking'],Great hike.  My wife and I departed the trail head @715 am and summited at 1pm.  The trail was in good condition.  A few snow crossings but nothing a good pair of trail sneakers can’t handle.  We saw a few moose in the valley and lots of goats towards the summit.  We departed the summit at 1:30pm and finished at 430pm.  A long day but doable.  I would recommend this trail to anyone in good fitness.  
34,2019-08-19,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'snow', 'washed out']",My husband and I (ages 59 & 56) summited today after a failed attempt last week via Aspen Grove due to altitude sickness. Today was hard but we made it. Sunday’s are always less crowded on this trail. One thing  to note. There was a very dangerous snow bridge that was about to break making it extremely dangerous. A group of 3 were terrified and wouldn’t cross it so a unit of search and rescue had to go help them across. I “vouched” for them telling them I literally cried crossing it. We told them it should be broken down although lots of people made it safely across. Be careful and it you’re fearful I wouldn’t recommend this route until they break down snow bridge. 
35,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"This trail is great! Very little snow left but we still got to glyssade a little bit. One potentially iffy snow bridge, we didn’t have a problem but it can be slippery and you wouldn’t want to break through the snow. This hike is still quite hard but worth it. For those of you afraid of heights- I am too but I was able to make it all the way on this one. Saw some moose and mountain goats as well. Also, I cannot stress this enough- don’t be a piece of trash and leave toilet paper on the trail. It’s gross, smelly, and there’s literally a pit toilet available about 6 miles up."
36,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"Beautiful but difficult hike (8/18). Still a decent amount of snowfields on the hike, spikes strongly recommended. As the previous reviewer mentioned, there is an extremely dangerous snow bridge about 4 miles up the trail. I would recommend timing your hike to traverse this bridge in the early morning or late evening hours, when the snow on the bridge has re-frozen. When we were there in the afternoon, the sun was beating down on the bridge, and we were watching it melt and deteriorate before our very eyes. If it collapses while you’re on it, you’d fall maybe 10 feet or so to a rocky riverbed, and I think hurt yourself pretty badly. If there are a couple more days of heat/sun on the trail, it may take care of itself and completely melt away (which would also open up the normal path/trail that is basically blocked by this snow bridge). But if you’re hiking soon, be ready for this part. "
37,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"Good trail, easy to follow, very crowded.  "
38,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful, challenging hike. Beautiful water falls, Mt. meadows and abundant wildlife, mule deer, turkey and many  mt goats a long the way. We hiked on 8/17/2019 and the snow crossings were very doable. What a great experience and memories with my two nephew's!!!!"
39,2019-08-17,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Still several snow crossings but very doable. We brought poles which made it much easier but most people we saw did not have them. Started at 12:40am and summitted at 6:30am. Absolutely beautiful. Definitely took the slide down the snow. Bring garbage bags.
40,2019-08-16,"['hiking', 'scramble']",Amazing hike
41,2019-08-14,['hiking'],"Summited on Monday 8/12. Left the parking lot at 930am (plenty of parking available at that time still) and got back to the lot at 530pm. From the saddle to the Summit it was 1 hour round trip which was longer than I thought it would take. Very few snow fields and they were soft. Used my yak tracks though just because I really didn't want to risk even a small slip. Really, besides being an 8 hour hike, the only really challenging part was from the saddle to the Summit and back. Everything else at this time was not that hard. We saw a 6 year old at the saddle. "
42,2019-08-14,"['hiking', 'snow']","Most beautiful trail ever! Multiple waterfalls, wildflowers, great views all along the way, and wildlife galore. My husband and I saw a herd of mountain goats, a deer, and plenty of chipmunks and other jitters. Someone else on the trail saw a bear, so bear spray is recommended. There was snow in August and we had to make staffs out of sticks. We slid down a pitch on the way down like a slide. We didn’t quite make it to the top because of a lack of sun but I cannot wait to try it again soon. "
43,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"Summited on Sunday 8/11/19. Absolutely beautiful! Parked at 6:15am and lot was 3/4 full. Started hiking at 6:30am and reached the summit at 11:10am. One small snow section around 4-4.5 miles in, and then a few snow crossings on the switchbacks just before the saddle (5-5.5 miles in). We managed with hiking boots and trekking poles. Really windy after the saddle so recommend an extra layer! The last mileish of the trail is very exposed and rocky but the views are exceptional! We made it back to the car around 4:00p-4:15p. Plan on a full 10 hours for this one. 
Oh and word to the wise: there is an exposed pit toilet along the offshoot trail at 4.75 miles in. It's hidden in the first grove of trees you come to.  "
44,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'snow']","Three of us (I'm 61, wife 50 and daughter 27) summited via the Aspen Grove trailhead.  We went down the Timp trail.  Read my review over on the Aspen Grove page.  More but smaller snow slides on this side.  If you don't have crampons be very careful, even with the small slides. I took it for granted, slipped and slid about 20' to the rocks below, bending a hiking pole in the process.  Then on the very last crossing I had 2 steps to go and also slipped, falling on my backside.  No crampons were used on either of these falls.  The Timp side is less steep and better trail conditions.  Saw lots of goats but only on the Aspen Grove trail.  Wife and glissaded down the snow and it was a blast; Bring a plastic garbage bag!"
45,2019-08-08,"['hiking', 'snow']","Summited on 8/4 - great trail & gorgeous views! The short detour to Scout Falls along the way offers unique views and is well worthwhile. Stream crossings are numerous to start, but can easily be navigated to keep your feet dry. The snow crossings are doable w/o spikes or poles, most ppl on the trail didn’t have either and did not have their progress limited. That said, poles at the very least would be recommended; I personally wouldn’t have felt comfortable without them on 3-4 of the crossings. I did bring spikes and an ice axe (overkill) but only ended up using the latter to practice glissading. Overall, a very scenic and enjoyable trail, not aggravatingly rocky, not strenuously steep & good chances of wildlife sightings - saw moose and goats. The entire hike took me 7.5 hrs with a nice hiatus on top to soak in the views.  "
46,2019-08-08,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","Went to the saddle thanks to Brian who we met on the way up. We were about to give up at the big rock field that was challenging at the last and hardest part until  he showed up to encourage us to keep going. So glad he did! Thank you, Brian! You were truly a God-sent! 

Snow fields still there in places but not as bad as it was earlier in the summer from what I was reading from past posts. The biggest snow field is right before the saddle but it’s softer than the smaller ones on the way up so you can dig your feet in for better footing. Mud wasn’t an issue for us. Hot but the cool breezes off the snow and waterfalls were great! Felt amazing at the saddle! What a view! A trip that was thrilling, bone chilling at times but mostly BEAUTIFUL!!!!! 

Oh and the trekking poles made life a whole lot easier!! A must have! "
47,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"So fun. Did August 2nd, recommend poles at least. I didn’t have microspikes but definitely needed the poles. Extremely green and lots of water flow. Not too busy but still a decent amount of traffic. "
48,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'snow']","Aug 2-3. Hiked up timpooneke trail and camped overnight near emerald lake. The hike was fantastic, and the temp at night was chilly but not freezing. We slept in hammocks with bags, coats, sweats, and thermals. You can make it through the snow without crampons or polls, but you'll be much less anxious about it if you have them. Crampons might be overkill, but we had poles which were very helpful, and shoes with good traction would have been very nice. I'd say maybe 4 of the 12ish snow crossings were a little sketchy. Probably saw ~100 other hikers on Saturday. Bring a trash bag and you'll get some good sliding opportunities. Great hike, beautiful scenery, and unmatched views from the summit!"
49,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']",Summited 8/3 starting out around 1 am. We got there before sunrise. it was gorgeous and worth it. I went with a friend. We each had one pole. I carried crampons the whole time and chose not to use them. We slid down the snow in a few parts for fun with trash bags. The snow gets soft and squishy during the day. I would not do it again without the poles as a minimum. Microspikes would have made it better. 
50,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']",
51,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'snow']",For those who are wondering the snow is still there and doesn’t look like it’s leaving any time soon. I highly recommend shoe spikes and walking sticks. One glacier right before the meadow we nicknamed “big kahuna” is very steep and you could get hurt if you’re unprepared. This hike is hard enough without the ice.
52,2019-08-03,['hiking'],"This is a really fun hike, but as of 8/3/19, there is still a lot of snow that covers the trail. It has been heavily trafficked, but you have maybe a 12 inch wide trail that you have to make your way over, and it is super slick, and if you slip you slide all the way down to the rocks. We saw three people slip off the snow and slide down, hitting rocks along the way. It was scary. If you decide to go while there is still snow, spikes would be best, but if you take nothing else, AT LEAST bring poles. The poles saved us today from sliding down. "
53,2019-08-01,['hiking'],July 31st... Summited...Still a decent amount of snow crossings with maybe 3-4 that would be well to have at least poles but are easily navigated with spikes or crampons... Only used my crampons on the way back down near the saddle. Recommend bringing trashbags for sliding down some of the areas on the way back down or for the occasional rainstorm:)
54,2019-07-30,"['hiking', 'snow']","July 23rd
Hike to the basin was pretty easy with a few tracked out snow crossings. Getting up to the saddle still has lots of snow and at night it was hard to find the tracked out path but in day light the path is easy to find. Hiking up it is easier than going back down. Micro spikes, a spiked pole, hiking poles, or all three would help calm the nerves in a few spots. The worst part is right before you get to the saddle. If i did it this time next year again I’d bring at least some poles. Maybe it’s gotten better the last few days though. "
55,2019-07-29,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']",Made it to the top with the family with no issues. Snow is easily traversable. Came down the glacier side and had a blast. Great hike and beautiful day!
56,2019-07-28,['hiking'],the best!!!
57,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","Went up on the 26th of July with a mixed skill group of 19. Absolutely breathtaking hike. By far one of my favorites. Be sure to take the short sideline to the falls, it'll blow your mind. Straight up.
Crossing the snowfields gets a little hair-raising without spikes or poles. We went into it 5.1 miles before reaching a snowfield too risky to cross with the group we had and the equipment we didn't have. 
Almost made it up to the meadow before turning back, for a total of 10.2 miles, 6.5 hours total, with stops and waiting for inexperienced members of the group. "
58,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","The first 3 miles are beautiful, hero dirt, a couple streams to cross but not bad. After mile 3-4 you start running into snow fields that are a bit precarious to traverse. Wouldn’t recommend taking small kids beyond the 3-4mile mark. The last two Upper snow fields are steep and you are very exposed with rocks below. There’s a little mud but not bad, wear good shoes and go slow - was very doable."
59,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"My son and me hiked from Timpooneke to the Summit, on Thursday 25 July 2019. About 1415 in the middle of switchback between Summit and Saddle, a massive Hail/Rain/Lightning Storm hit. Tommy from Orem UT helped us went through two major icefields from Saddle towards Timpanogos Basin. It's very scary. We are forever grateful for Tommy's heroic actions that day."

63,2019-07-26,['hiking'],I love his hike. I am a resident of Utah and have hiked it 8 times. Hoping to get a ninth in there this year. Beautiful trail and surroundings. Wildlife is plentiful. Highly recommended!
64,2019-07-25,['hiking'],7/22. The first 3 miles or so are free of snow. Patches begin after this and persist up to the saddle. The final mile or so before the saddle is very snowy and traverses of steep snow fields are required. Poles and micro spikes / crampons highly recommended. The final mile after the saddle up to the peak is snow free. 
65,2019-07-22,['hiking'],You can reach the summit now. There is still snow on about 1-1.5 miles of the trail but there are visible paths in the snow you can see.
66,2019-07-17,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']",7/17/19 We started at midnight and hiked through little pieces of snow and then around 3.4 miles up there were some big snow fields. Turned around and came back. Probably could make it with crampons and ice picks but too dangerous and slippery because of the grade. 
67,2019-07-14,['hiking'],better than the Provo side of the mountain!! 
68,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"An amazing hike, we were there for the sunrise on 12 July. The trail is very wet right now with all of the runoff and the snowpack is still very big. We brought Krampons and mountaineering axes and we still could not make it to the summit (about 750ft in elevation below). Note that we backpacked into the meadow on Friday and tried to summit on Saturday for the sunrise."
69,2019-07-07,['hiking'],hiked on 7/6/19 was not able to make it to the upper meadow do to snow pack. one fallen tree over trail at beginning other the. that it was in good shape. 
70,2019-07-05,"['hiking', 'snow']",The trail has seen better years. Many of trees are laid down from a heavy winter and avalanches at the bottom. We were able to make it to the snow fields and then turn around. Trail becomes lost and there are steep traverses across snow. Krampons and ice axe suggested.
71,2019-07-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'scramble', 'snow']",We made it about 4.5 miles up this trail and then had to turn around.  Lost the trail several times due to the amount of snow still covering it.  Lots of mud and snow.  Krampons and poles necessary to continue further than we went.  
72,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'snow']","Excellent to go up there on a Friday or Saturday before everyone else goes to simply touch scout falls, but after the falls there is a TON of washed snow so be careful , chains and climbers are needed if you want to go more than 3 miles in"
73,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'scramble', 'snow']","first attempt: had to call it off as there was way to much snow to figure out where the trail was supposed to be going. Will attempt again in a few weeks, but from what I did (about 4 mi up) it was gorgeous

74,2019-05-29,['hiking'],Always a great hike.  Very long need to start early but a fun hike.
75,2019-04-30,[''],"Beautiful hike. We always go in August, and slide down the glacier and go down the other side. Very difficult hike but so so worth it."
76,2019-04-07,['hiking'],"Fabulous hike! Easily among the five best hikes in Utah. It is long and has substantial elevation gain and loss, and weather is fickle, so be prepared physically and take a jacket, sweatshirt. Rain gear, good shoes and calorie packed lunch plus 3. + liters drinking water. Oh, a camera or sketchbook too. And all this would be for a summer hike in the day. That is when we went, middle of July with fabulous mountain wildflowers everywhere! You would want to adjust your gear to the season of course.. views from the top are tremendous: Views way down to Utah Valley and beyond, many peaks to the east north and south, and straight down to Emerald Lake; be careful it’s quite a drop. A storm was coming in, so we stayed only about five minutes."
77,2018-11-01,['hiking'],"This is a really tough hike in the snow. We went on Sunday 10/28 and from about mile 3 onwards it was all in snow. We'd tried on Thursday and had only got as far as the meadow as the winds were so strong we couldn't even see our own tracks and couldn't find the trail.  We managed to summit on Sunday but from the saddle to the hut and back again was very windy and very sketchy.  If you've never done this before (which I hadn't), it's definitely not for the faint-hearted. Once over the saddle, the drops are very very steep and, I thought, very very scary. The views, however, are spectacular and the trail was pretty easy to follow.  The whole thing took us 10 hours as it was slow going in the snow, so we came out in the dark. Be prepared and stay safe!"
78,2018-10-24,['hiking'],We hiked this over Labor day weekend.  The views and wildlife we saw were totally worth the hard hike. It was amazing!
79,2018-10-14,['hiking'],"This was my first time on the trail. As of yesterday, it will take breaking trail for the final two miles to get to the summit. I wasn't willing to go further than the tracks went. There was a wind slab just before ""the meadow"" that I wasn't willing to cross, as well as some other evidence of snow instability along the way. I wanted to write this review to let people know that this trail is probably a ski/mountaineering adventure and not a hike at this point (probably from about mile 4) until next season. In addition, I was glad I had microspikes on my shoes after the first mile. It was intermittent ice/snow and mud for a couple miles and then straight snow after that."
80,2018-10-11,[''],love this hike ALOT.
81,2018-10-06,['hiking'],"First of all let me say WOW!  We are from the Midwest and this was the third hike of our short stay. We wanted to go out with a Bang! And it felt like we did.  We chose this hike based on reviews on this site so let me add my .02 (keep in mind we live at 800 ft.). We didn’t get to the lot as early as we had hoped but we started out just before 0900.  Gradual climb and to be honest we got a little cocky, took our time and tons of photos. After we hit the first meadow and headed up it got a little steeper and the snow started at 8200 feet, the views were beautiful. We honestly didn’t know what we were in for as we knew (hoped) to crest but we saw the peak here and there through all the weather that came through.  When we hit the last meadow before the push to the saddle we started running into what appeared to us were locals who actually knew what they were doing. We even believe that we met the famous “Ben”.  We started running into a few people who decided not to go further or had been warned of the conditions at the saddle and had already turned around or stopped their ascent. If we actually met “Ben” he had also decided to not even head to the saddle.  We had traveled too far to quit and the altitude clearly clouded our judgement (Ha) so we continued.  We followed up who to us must have been an Olympian (she was nicknamed the Olympian) as well as two runners. The trip to the saddle was super sketchy as there was ice under the snow (3”) on the rocks but we had made it.  We encountered both runners later who tried to reach the peak but neither did.  At the saddle we talked to the “olympian” who was super nice and it sounded like she had made this hike before.  Her group backed out due to weather so she came up on her own.   After talking to her for a few minutes she also decided not to try and reach the summit.  Visibility was about 30 feet and snow was getting deeper. I decided that I loved my wife so we opted out. “The Olympian “ was kind enough to take a few pictures of us and we followed her down.  The hike was amazing and was plenty difficult. The people that we encountered were awesome. If you get a chance to try, make sure you do it.  Make sure to bring plenty of water and fuel."
82,2018-10-06,['hiking'],A Utah classic
83,2018-10-04,['hiking'],"It was a crazy adventure up to Mtn. Timpanogos Summit! There was 40 mph wind, rain, snow, clouds, and sunshine all together. It was a fun Utah hiking experience that’s for sure! I definitely learned to come in July- Mid August while the wild flowers are blooming and the sunshine is shining! Don’t go in October. Haha! Also, you’ll see so many mountain goats! They do love to get their photos taken and chill on the trail, but don’t get too close.
It’s a challenging hike and some sections are steep, so plan for 6-8 hours of the day hiking (based off your pace or group size). I highly recommend going with at least one buddy. Bring enough food (like a snack & a lunch), at least 2 liters or more of water, a light-weight windbreaker, and a extra pair of socks or dry shirt to change into for hike back down (it’s definitely worth it). 
Have a fun adventure and stay safe out there."
84,2018-10-04,[''],"Amazing hike/trail Run!  You will likely see wildlife, moose, deer, mountain goats, jackalobes... ok maybe not the last one.  
Anyway, if its your first time hiking Timpanogos bring one more layer of clothes than you think will need. It's usually super Humid, windy and much colder at the top than you would guess.  
Bring more FOOD than you might think you need and multiple bottles of WATER!  Your hike will go so much better if you eat and drink enough. remember to snack/fuel frequently. 

I also used strava on this trail and it told me Out and Back is actually 16 ish miles.  Just an FYI.  
This is a stunningly beautiful hike. You are going to love it.
Have fun!"
85,2018-10-01,['hiking'],"Hiked on Sept 29, 2018; mostly sunny with daily high around 75 degrees, left from Timpooneke.  This is the best weekend for changing leaves, which explains the large crowds. At 4:00 am about 70% of the parking lot was filled.  (If you haven’t paid, use the envelopes to avoid a ticket, which we saw on many cars after we returned.)  We started at 4:30 am, hiked in dark with headlamps until about 7:30.  This means we hiked through the fall colors in total dark, completely missing them on the way up.  This is a long hike, but also probably the easiest of the big peaks in the area. Trails are very nice and easy to follow, with relatively uniform ascent the entire way.  There is nothing dangerous or technical, it’s just long. A cold, strong wind from the west was blowing on the west side of the mountain, which you hit at the saddle. Light windbreaker was much more valuable than heavier clothes that breathes because the wind goes right through that. Otherwise, the west side was very pleasant. Trail was very busy.  We needed about 3 quarts of water.  Total trip was a bit over 8 hours, which included a few, but not many, rest periods."
86,2018-10-01,['hiking'],"September 30, 2018. Driving to Mt Timp, it was sunny and warm for late September with temps close to 70 in Heber at 7:45. The summit of Timp looks extremely imposing from a distance but the hike is quite gentle for the first 6 miles. The fall foliage was peaking so the entire valley was red and yellow. As we got above the tree line, the wind really started to pick up and the temps started to drop. Once we got on the ridge, the wind was howling at about 30-40 mph but luckily you hike to the summit on the west side of the mountain so the wind was pushing you into the mountain. The final mile to the summit is steep but it doesn’t require any true bouldering. The summit has a cool metal open hut which provides a little reprieve from the wind. The summit offers amazing views of Provo/Utah Lake to the southwest and Heber to the Northeast. We saw some impressive mountain goats on the way down. It took us 4 hours up with about a 20min lunch break and 3 hours down. Round trip was 14.5 miles."
87,2018-09-30,[''],"This was 100% hardest trail I’ve ever done. It took us 10.5 hours to hike all the way to the top summit. I am not the most physically fit person  and my knee was killing me by the end but it’s worth it! Watch out for high winds at the Top ( an extra windbreaker or sweater) and take enough water!  On our way down we did spot a black bear, moose, and deer ( dusk) - of your not fast make sure you pack a headlamp, it was very helpful ( specially if you start you up hike anytime after 9am"
88,2018-09-24,[''],"Challenging trail climb for any serious trail runner. Compared to other trails the only steep sections are on the Saddle. First 6.5 miles of climbing are gradual ascents with some descents and flat terrains in the meadow to regain your pace.  However, the hidden rocks as tree stumps from start to finish and the completely all rock portions make this a difficult and treacherous attempt for any serious trails runners legs from avoiding any injuries. Unless- your well trained the return trip down the mountain will break your knees and sting your quads muscles. Nonetheless- a grand epic experience one must not leave out!"
89,2018-09-17,[''],"A very difficult hike, but so rewarding!"
90,2018-09-17,[''],"Hiked this on Sept 7th. Camped at Emerald Lake. Left trailhead at 4 pm. Reached lake by 7. Lots of vertical gain. A few streams near the start give you an opportunity to fill up on water. Highly recommend. From there, the next source is Emerald Lake. Was merely a pond on the 7th; it will dry up. Very few people this late in the day; beautiful. Camped. Next day - traversed to the saddle. Left pack at saddle. Took me two hours to summit from Emerald Lake. Gorgeous views of the Salt Lake Valley and the Wasatch Wilderness. Well worth the mental and physical challenge of the steep vertical, and relentless switchbacks.

Important to realize Emerald Lake is not a part of this trail. Must go well out of the way for water, and as I said, would be surprised if the lake makes it much longer. Bring more water than you need."
91,2018-09-16,[''],Favorite hike! I’ve done it 7 times and it’s a new experience every time.
92,2018-09-16,['hiking'],Left at 3am from Timpanooki parking and made the summit at 8:30am. The sun came up right at the meadows at 7am. The wind at the Sandle wasn’t too bad with the sun up. Great and difficult hike.
93,2018-09-06,['hiking'],"Not for the feint of heart once you pass the meadow. The trail hugs the side of the mountain pretty closely in a few places, and there are some scree piles you cross. Once you reach the saddle, the rest of the trail to the top of Timp requires some basic scrambling, and you need hands and feet in a number of places. it's quite steep.

This hike is beautiful, rewarding, and challenging all at the same time. the view from the saddle is beautiful, but the view from Timp is awesome. There is very little water along the trail, and very little shade the last half of the trail up. Bring sunscreen and water (I brought a full gallon). 

We also saw some pika, two female moose, and got some great selfies with a mountain goat. 

please pick up your trash, too!!"
94,2018-09-06,[''],"Beautiful views all the way to the top! Definitely worth an early start. Not too difficult, just long, as others mentioned."
95,2018-09-03,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! Went this morning with my friends and we loved it, although we all agreed it was pretty difficult. We started at midnight and got to the summit around 5 am. The trail was very popular this morning because everyone wanted to watch the sunrise from the summit. Also, it is freezing once you reach the saddle, so bring warm clothes!! Watching the sunrise was incredible and the hike back down in the day time was gorgeous. Definitely recommend if you’ve never hiked this trail before. Just be prepared... it’s tough."
96,2018-09-03,['hiking'],"Hiked 7/4/18. Beautiful, gradual hike that never gets too steep. There are a few different stages of the hike, each with pretty different surroundings, which keeps things interesting. Beware the “point of despair.” They’ll be a moment when you think you’ve made it, only to realize how much further you’ve got to go! 

Found the altitude was only really a problem during the final mile, and the trade off for the gradual ascent is a prolong descent (knees = dead)."
97,2018-09-02,[''],"Hiked this with my husband yesterday. We started at 4:00 in the morning and hiked a couple of hours and then through the sunrise. This hike was so beautiful. It didn’t seem too hard for me but it was quite long. You pass through meadows and a few different landscapes before coming to a giant meadow where you can then see the saddle and the peak. The view from the summit was breathtaking. It was quite crowded yesterday, but we figured it would be with it being a Saturday and Labor Day weekend. We got one of the few parking spaces left. But we enjoyed meeting new like minded people. We did get stopped on the trail for over 30 min in the dark when a bull moose and 2 babies wouldn’t move. They just kept eating. It was a cool experience though. We also saw a few mountain goats and a whole family of deer in the meadow. Will definitely do this hike again and maybe even try a sunrise summit."
98,2018-09-02,['hiking'],My favorite hike! So pretty up there! Definitely worth the view going all the way to the shack at the top
99,2018-08-31,['hiking'],"This trail is really long not sure about 7 miles is accurate but the views and wild life is awesome. we started around 6:30 on Wednesday parking lot was having around 10 cars. we saw moose , mountain goats and deer. it surprise you with multiple meadow and multiple layers of vegetation. the final 1 mile is little strenuous and need careful stepping and resting. The trail is long and beautiful. best to carry lot of water food, jacket , gloves and hiking poles."
100,2018-08-30,['hiking'],"Did this hike on a Friday morning in late August. Arrived at parking lot at 7:30am and still plenty of parking. Trail was not very busy. There were a few trail runners, but mostly hikers. Don't be intimidated if you are a casual hiker. It is doable - just take your time, eat snacks, and pack plenty of water in a camelbak. There is plenty to see and hear. A bull moose hangs out in the meadow at the 2 mile mark. I've been told you can make it to the summit in 4 hours, but I stopped for photos and time to breath and talk and took 6.5 hours to the saddle. I was too tired and afraid of heights to do the summit, but I'm going to try it next time. It took 4 hours to come down going at a steady pace. Recommend trekking poles for descent."
101,2018-08-27,['hiking'],Bloody fantastic hike. Beautiful from every view.
102,2018-08-26,['hiking'],"Started Friday after work, hiked to meadow with full backpacking gear.   Setup camp, got water at lake, and slept the night.   Headed towards the peak at 7am, after summit came back for gear, and hiked out.  This pattern is way better than the all night hikes.   People on the trail tend to not have good trail etiquette, play radios, don't stop if you are hiking up, often cram you on the trail.  Even had some kids shortcut the trail, sending rocks down on us, during the steep portion before the summit.  My point being, be careful, help educate the new folks, and be cautious of others.   Beautiful day, no mud, and only light rain both days."
103,2018-08-26,[''],We started out early 5:15 am on a Saturday but had to park along the road. The parking lot was full. Weather was comfortable with a jacket at the top but wind is chilly. Amazing views and trail is gradual until the last mile. Be ready for some rock scrambling. We saw two hikers turn around because they were too scared. My group got to the top.
104,2018-08-24,['hiking'],"I did this trail yesterday (a Thursday), and at 6:30 there were no problems with parking. The lot was less than a third full, maybe less than a quarter full.  The best part of the hike is through the forests/meadows before reaching the Upper Basin. I saw four moose and an elk in the first meadow within minutes of starting the hike.  I also saw four mountain goats. The first was at the upper end of the Lower Basin (close view), and the other three were on the mountain side to the right of Timp (one close). What none of the reviews I read here or elsewhere mention is what the trail is like for those who don't like heights.  The last 100 yards or so before reaching the saddle is narrow, has a large drop-off, and parts with loose dirt that are angled down toward he drop off. For that section, I was hanging onto the wall with my right hand, testing the dirt and rocks with the hiking pole in my left hand, and stepping about 6 inches at a time. In parts it was no more than about 18 -20 inches wide. The saddle was as far as I went, as going to the summit looked about the same (without a wall on one side). I don't care if your 3 year old carrying a Barbie did it. For those who don't like heights, just be aware that you will probably only want to go **part way** up to the saddle, where you might see mountain goats up close (as I did).  The views from the saddle weren't that spectacular.  The rest of the hike up to the Upper Basin, and through it is GREAT.  The trail to that point (and even to the saddle) is physically less strenuous than many other hikes I have done. Lots of level parts, and it is never very steep."
105,2018-08-24,[''],"Love this one! Not too hard, and great views!!"
106,2018-08-24,[''],"Did this hike couple weeks ago. Great hike, long but very rewarding (coming back down we asked ourselves a couple times if this is really how far we had to travel up) there's a point past the saddle where you have to cut left with bigger steps up the rock, the trail seems to go straight. me and my girlfriend plus 4 other people we ran into ended up going straight. we ended up on some questionable terrain which was pretty steep with loose rock. on the way back down we stacked some rocks across the area that seems like the trail hopefully that helps some others out. the view from the top is amazing we will definitely be back!"
107,2018-08-24,['hiking'],Awesome hike! Be wary of the final mile!
108,2018-08-23,[''],"We hiked this trail last Friday.  Even got to see Ben Woolsey!!  Lots of people running up and down the mountain.  Started at 5:15 am and there were still spots available for parking.  Heard lots of howling coming from a pack of coyotes and saw lots of mountain goats and one bull moose.  Unbelievable experience, as usual.  Just past the saddle watch for the cairns on your left to lead you up the correct trail (towards the shack).  We didn’t notice them and ended up hiking on a sketchy trail and had to backtrack."
109,2018-08-22,['backpacking'],"Beautiful.  Great weather.  Great backpacking.  There is no water after scout falls, so plan accordingly.  We saw mountain goats and deer.  It was raining,  but we had the right gear.  It took 4 hours to summit for us with packs on."
110,2018-08-22,[''],"we got to the trailhead at about 4:30am and we got one of the last parking spots. 
the sunrise was beautiful and one or a kind! I highly recommend getting there early. the only problem was that we did the hike on a Saturday and the trail was over crowded. "
111,2018-08-20,[''],"We did a sunrise hike, started at 2:30am and hit summit at 6:18. We were doing a pretty good pace, were all well-prepped physically and only took a couple short breaks. This is a hike that I would recommend doing in the night to be able to see the sunrise. Also, because it’s a beautiful hike down and you don’t really realize how much you climbed until your way down. "
112,2018-08-20,['hiking'],"Started at 3pm, plenty of parking available and only a handful of other hikers on the trail...most were returning from the Summit.  Really enjoyed the switchbacks and the trail was easy to follow to the Saddle.  Took a wrong turn from the Saddle to the Summit.  FOLLOW THE STACKED ROCKS!  I followed footprints leading me off of the trail onto a pretty steep/cliffy grade.  Took a minute for me to backtrack and find the trail again.  The view from the Summit was incredible...definitely a must see!  And I was surprised to be the only one up there for almost an hour.
The hike back was a fun adventure with a few rain showers, spotting more wildlife (mountain goat/deer)  and about 2 hrs of hiking in the dark.  The lightning show was breathtaking!  Made it back to the parking lot just before 11pm.
Needs for my hike included: Hydrating well before the hike to prevent cramping, sunscreen, sunglasses, an extra layer of clothing for the Summit and after dark, rain poncho, and head lamp.  Took up 2L of water (had plenty left over that we gave to a family that was running low) and some snacks to keep my energy up (fruit leather, nut rolls, jerky).
Excited to hike Timp again soon and hope this review helps for any first time Timp hikers."
113,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"Beatiful sites along the trail. Difficult, but well worth the effort! Views from the top were unreal. There weren’t many wildflowers along the trail though. Started at 4 am and the parking lot was mostly full."
114,2018-08-18,[''],"I love this trail! So many great views, wildlife, and scenery."
115,2018-08-18,['hiking'],"We started this hike at 12:30am so we could watch the sunrise and we were finally got back to our car at 11:30am so we were hiking a lot longer than expected! This is the hardest hike I’ve ever done, but it’s definitely possible and very rewarding and BEAUTIFUL at the top! I don’t think I’ll do this hike again for a long time since it’s SO difficult especially the last mile and a half (It took us an hour). But I still highly recommend this hike! It is absolutely FREEZING at the top so wear very very warm clothes! Also all trails says it’s 14 miles, but it’s definitely longer. My Apple Watch says it was 18 miles so keep that in mind!"
116,2018-08-15,['hiking'],"It had been 25 or so years since I'd been up this side, and I'd also forgotten how much easier it is in comparison to the Aspen Grove Trail head. I just love the long climbing switchbacks across the terraces, and how the views in both directions are changing continually throughout the hike. Between the two and three mile marks (approximately) there is also excellent opportunity to see plentiful sea life fossils, if you know what you're looking for. Water sources become more and more limited as the season draws out, so be aware, carry plenty and consider a filter. This mountain is so amazingly majestic, and never disappoints, at least in my opinion. Even if you only plan to hike to the basin, this is one of the easier places to always spot Mountain Goats, which is always entertaining. Excellent hike, I need to knock this one out again before the season is finished!"
117,2018-08-15,['backpacking'],"We started at 5pm on a Friday. There were plenty of spaces to park. The incline isn’t bad, it’s the distance that makes this hike difficult. By 9pm, the sun went down and it was amazing! As you look down the valley, you’ll see people starting their hikes for sunrise. We made it to the meadow/basin area in 7 hours (we had large backpacks on requiring multiple stops), slept over, started our summit at 9am. It took us 2hrs to get from the meadow to the saddle. From the saddle on is where it gets tough; if you’re scare of heights, this is where you’ll have to debate if you’ll summit or not. Pass the saddle, you’ll do a bit of scrambling to summit. It took us another hour from the saddle to the shack to summit. I highly recommend bringing a lot of water and a filter. There’s not much water on the trail, all the spring falls are dried up now. 
Totaled hours hike (for a slow hiker): 14hrs."
118,2018-08-14,['backpacking'],Beautiful hike! We started around 9:30pm and got to the Basin around 1am. I had some altitude sickness during the last mile that added some time. We camped in the basin and watched the sunrise then headed back down. Hard hike but worth it!
119,2018-08-13,[''],"Took the first step at 5:30 a.m. Hit the summit in 3 hours flat, back down in 2.5. Trail was beautifully uncrowded on a Sunday morning. Found myself face to face with a couple good-sized mountain goats, but they were super chill. Pretty wiped out, but a great hike!"
120,2018-08-11,['hiking'],Hiked this trail on 8/4/18.  Started around 5:00 am and found very little parking available.  We parked on the highway and walked to the trailhead.  Hiked in the dark for an hour or so and then had all the spectacular views all the way up.  There were so many people coming down from the top looking pretty miserable and tired.  Overnight hiking is overrated.  3:40 to the top.  and and about 3 hours to the bottom. 3L water.  It was a fun day.
121,2018-08-09,[''],This was a longggggg hike! Not too hard though. We started at 2:30am and our group ended up splitting up in the meadow. Made it for the sunrise at the summit and it was FREEZING!! But the east side of the mountain warm and nice. So bring a jacket if you go that early. We encountered a moose and it’s baby about an hour in right on the trail. The group right behind us sent their dog to get the moose off of the trail but it ended up charging at us! Super scary and thankfully we were able to slide down the cliff a little bit so we didn’t get trampled. Definitely need headlamps but I liked hiking at night. I didn’t need all the water I brought because it wasn’t too hot. The sun coming back wasn’t too bad but I felt for the people heading up around 10am. That’s a different hike I’m sure! Not sure I’d do it again but it was so beautiful and worth it!
122,2018-08-07,[''],wowowowwowoowwow so pretty. but also I just got back and I am dead. this is a pretty hard hike but work yourself up to it. its totally worth it
123,2018-08-07,['hiking'],"I did the hike on a Sunday and started at 6 am.  The trail was not crowded the day that I went little more people in the afternoon but not bad. I would rate the first 6 miles as moderate and the last mile or so as hard as you will go up some steep slopes at the top.  It took me just over 4 hours to get up with a lot of stops to enjoy the trail and see the wildlife.  I was able to see a moose with baby, 4 deer, and 2 mt goats with in the first 3 miles but did not see much after that.  I would bring plenty of water there is water on the trail but it’s all within the first 2 miles unless you are hiking to the lake then you will have water at the top. After hiking this trail I would tell anyone that is into hiking this one is a must.  Even if it was only to the saddle it would be worth it."
124,2018-08-06,[''],"Beautiful but crowded on the weekends. Started at 6:30am and had to park down the road a ways. Saw some mountain goats and a baby, so cool. Not terribly difficult the first 6 miles or so. The last bit was a climb. The last few miles were long but over all it’s not terribly hard just long. Lots of people made for lots of passing in close areas. Oh and you will most likely need to use the bathroom along the way. There were tree areas that were used for the bathrooms. Please pick up and pack out your trash there!"
125,2018-08-06,['hiking'],"Hiked to the peak for the first time yesterday morning. Started just after 2am and made it to the peak by 5:30 with enough time to relax and enjoy the sunrise, which was absolutely beautiful. Summiting from the saddle to the peak was challenging after already being exhausted from hiking for several hours, but believe me, it is worth it. Plan extra time for water/ snack breaks. Pack a headlamp if you will be hiking at night, and pack layers. I started with just a long tee shirt and pants, then had to add layers at the top, but hiking down in the sun became pretty hot. Bring a sharpie to sign your name on the shack at the top!"
126,2018-08-05,['hiking'],Finally checked this hike off the bucket list! It was a fabulous day. 3 hours and 45 minutes to the summit and then back to the car in 7.5 hours round trip. It was a Saturday and super crowded. We had to park on the road about .5 mike from trailhead. Started at 6:00.
127,2018-08-04,['hiking'],Beautiful and challenging.
128,2018-08-04,[''],"Great hike with the three Kings. Trail was maintained well until the extremely large mountain goat began to chase us up the hill. One of my friends (College bound football player) struggled greatly as he brought little to no food including only Ritz crackers and Saltines and promptly ran out of water on the way up. He also complained the entire way down (exaggerating about organ failure) to the car and made the trek longer then necessary while taking ample breaks. Meanwhile my other friend and I had little to no struggle and didn’t complain the ENTIRE way down. Overall, a great experience."
129,2018-08-01,[''],"This is a stunning, beautiful, and brutal hike to the main summit!  Be prepared with either a gallon of water, or a filter to refill at one of the many cold, crystal clear streams on the trail and the lake near the base of the summit. Tons of wildflowers, mountain goats that’ll join you for parts of the hike, and amazing views (better if the fires were out).  Best to be well acclimated (I was not), as this is an uphill push every step of the way to the top"
130,2018-07-29,['hiking'],"Definitely a tough one for those who aren't conditioned (had one or two in my group who suffered quite a bit), but a fantastic hike for everyone else. coming up over the saddle is a fantastic view, and the summit is even better! Plenty of natural beauty along the way, and the wildflowers in the upper basin are in bloom. The mountain goats are super used to hikers and will even come within a few feet of you. Recommended for sure!"
131,2018-07-29,[''],Fantastic trail.  Long but not too steep.  The flowers are still amazing but won’t last long.  The mountain goats seem more friendly and more are at lower elevations than last year.
132,2018-07-26,[''],Tomorrow I will do this trail to summit 3 times in a 24 hour period. I love this mountain and would ask everyone to be mindful not to take any shortcuts between the switch backs. It destroys the terrain and because of the mountains rocky nature it just doesn’t recover for many years. Enjoy but don’t abuse.
133,2018-07-23,['hiking'],"Hiked this on July 3rd. My first hike in the mountains. I'm from the Caribbean, born and raised and from below sea level as well. My lungs would not let me make it past the saddle. Definitely will prepare better and do this again some time soon.
the views are worth the effort.
I think I've found me a new hobby!"
134,2018-07-22,[''],Loved it!!
135,2018-07-22,[''],Incredible hike. Hiked up with my boyfriend in 2015 and slept in the fields below the peak. Woke up early the next day and we caught the sunrise on the peak. I will always cherish that memory.
136,2018-07-16,[''],"Truly breathtaking! Started the trail around noon and got back to the car at 9PM. Moderate incline until the very end, but nothing very difficult - the length is what starts to wear you down. Wildflowers still in bloom and spotted some friendly goats along the way. A must do experience."
137,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"We got to the parking lot at 5:30am and it was full, so make sure to come early if you want a spot. Other than that it was a gorgeous hike! Lots of wild flowers, we saw multiple goats, deer, and even a moose was near the trail as we came around a corner. It took us about 5 hours up and 3 down."
138,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"Picked an amazing day to hike timpanogos. Started at 7 am. It was overcast so it stayed cool all day and even rained a bit. I would say this is rated difficult just because of the distance. I think the elevation gain is moderate. It was a gorgeous hike and the wildflowers are spectacular right now. Go soon before you miss them!! Took me 4 hours to get to the saddle, 5 to the summit and five to get back down.(down is always harder for my knees so I take it slow!)   I saw the infamous mountain goat mama and baby, chipmunks, and deer. Gorgeous hike and definitely worth going to the very top. There was seriously a party going on up there."
139,2018-07-14,['hiking'],"Great workout. Lots of people (several trail runners) on a narrow trail, but everyone was friendly. Watch out for stinging nettle."
140,2018-07-10,['hiking'],
141,2018-07-08,['hiking'],"What a beautiful hike. It was 8 miles to the summit, took me about 6 hours to reach it. I met another hiker who said it only took him 3 hours. I like to stop a take photos, enjoy the views. 5 miles up the side of the mountain to what I call the Grand Cirque. Great view if Timp and the saddle to the right. Beautiful meadows of wildflowers. And I can see the trail from Aspen Grove crossing the long rock slide/snow field. That’s a much tougher hike. The final climb up from the saddle is like a giant staircase. 40,000 steps total. I’m ready to go again. Go say hi to the goats."
142,2018-07-07,[''],Amazing hike today. The views were amazing. We started at 5am and the parking lot was full. Really hot until we reached higher elevation. A lot of people.
143,2018-07-07,[''],"Unbelievable and pretty tough.  We took our time and stopped to enjoy some moments along the way.  9 1/2 hours total.  Mountain Goats... yes!!!! Mamas with babies.  I wasn’t afraid until other “humans” started acting stupid!  Getting with in feet of the goats to take selfies, getting between mamas and babies.  Completely unaware that by getting close to the goats, they were scaring them and pushing them toward us.  Several times during the different encounters I thought someone was going to get charged.  I hate breaking trail, but there were 4 goats and 2 extremely stupid humans and I was genuinely afraid for the safety of our little group.  I was concerned, initially for the other hiker, until he kept opening his mouth!  After that, my concern retreated and we just got ourselves clear.  I felt very sad for this little goat family.  They were scared, and because of that, very aggressive.  Please be respectful of the animals.  We are guests in THEIR homes!"
144,2018-07-06,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. No water to pump after scout falls, bring a lot."
145,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"First time back on this trail in 20 years and hiked with my son and brother-in-law. They were both first time hikers and it was probably too far of a hike for their first time. We were doing good until we headed up the switchbacks to the saddle and then got delayed by two mama mountain goats and their two kids. They parked in the center of the trail at the end of the second south switchback and moved after 20 minuets. The aggressive one even came within 5 feet and stared us down for a good minute. They finally ascended above and we ran into them two more times and had to wait another 10 to 20 minuets each time. Now I’ve been chased by a mama moose up on Timp because I got between her and her calf unknowingly, so I wasn’t about to make the same mistake with these mountain goats!

Waiting on the cliff sides for that long was too much for my brother-in-law and my son so they only had enough energy left to make it to the saddle. It was still a gorgeous view and a perfect place to have lunch. Our goat friends were up there and came intimidatingly close to the group of us up there and they even parked right at the start of the trail to the summit and blocked our way up. So I take it as another manifestation of the “curse of the billy goat” since I’m a Cubs fan!

I was disappointed we didn’t summit, but I wouldn’t trade the experience for the world! I grew up on this mountain and absolutely love it’s majesty and beauty!"
146,2018-07-03,[''],"this hike was incredible. the most challenging one I've ever done. it isn't too steep for most of it, just very long. it's even flat on some spots. we saw lots of families with kiddos around 8-15 yo and I was so impressed that they made the summit! with me sea level lungs I made it to the saddle. it was very hard but rewarding. started 7am and made it back down in 10.5 hrs total time. had to stop a lot. it's very narrow and can be highly trafficked. wear hiking shoes!! bring lots of water and food. it's a full day affair. definitely do it! you won't be disappointed. "
147,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"As this was my first time hiking up a Utah mountain or mountain in the Rockies (I just moved here from the east coast), I wasn't sure what to expect.  Somewhere between mile 1 and 2, I made a wrong turn, and I was climbing up a steep rock field.  I had apparently missed my switchback.  Even though this is difficult, it's important to remember that horses take this trail.  So if you get to a spot where you think, ""there's no way horses could have climbed this,"" then you've probably gone the wrong way.  I made it about 5 miles before I decided to turn back.  Not knowing what to expect, I was worried about doing it solo, but I saw lots of people on the way.  There are a few small waterfalls.  Scout Falls is probably a mile or two up and is much larger than the other spring falls.  So it's not like you have to summit to see some great views.  The meadow which is probably around mile 3 is breathtaking.  The most adventurous part happened about a mile from the parking lot on the way back down.  I turned the corner of the trail and there standing in the path about fifteen feet away was a female moose. We stared at each other for a second, and then I bolted back up the trail. I waited to see if she was coming up the trail or would exit, and a few seconds later, there she was slowly walking up the narrow path. I bolted again. Just ahead of me was a spring/waterfall. My thought was that she would at least stop for a drink, so if I could get off the trail, and when she passed, then I could bolt down and escape behind her. I decided to climb up a little ravine off the trail in the brush and get behind a large tree. I figured if she came up, I could try and use the tree to block her if she tried to attack. As I held my breath as best as I could to be completely silent, I heard the faint sound of drums. After I listened for a second, I realized it was my own heart beating. When the moose was just below me on the trail, I heard voices of hikers that were about to approach her. I thought about yelling to warn them, but I was trying to stay quiet. Suddenly they yelled, ""Moose!"" and stopped. They had a small dog who was both timid and curious and it scared the moose. Unfortunately, it scared the moose right up the ravine where I was. So I started sliding trying to get behind the tree, and she heard me. It must have startled her because she ran down the path a bit further and then went up the ravine away from where I was. The hikers thought because of the noise I was making trying to get down that I was another moose. But in the end, we humans were happy to see each other."
148,2018-07-02,[''],What a beautiful hike! Started at 1:30am and hiked to see the sunrise. Heavily trafficked; saw a lot of groups headed to the Saddle around the same time as us. Amazing views throughout the entire hike! Highly recommend giving this one a go!
149,2018-07-01,[''],"It is definitely not an easy hike, but it worth completing. Every single step of the trail offered beautiful view of the mountains and wild flowers. We saw a few families of mountain goats with their babies. Loved that hike"
150,2018-07-01,['hiking'],Beautiful yet challenging hike.  Didn't feel the trail was extremely steep but it was difficult due to the length.  Once we passed the saddle it was pretty cold and windy.  I would've liked to have gloves with me as my hands were cold holding my trekking poles.  I did put a beanie and a jacket on.  Views throughout the trail are beautiful.  I'd recommend doing it at least once a year.
151,2018-07-01,['hiking'],
152,2018-06-28,[''],Must do once a year at least
153,2018-06-25,['hiking'],The most beautiful hike I have ever experienced.
154,2018-06-25,[''],"Beautiful hike!! My fit bit tracked 8.25 miles up not 7 like the description says. But worth it! The first 7 miles are pretty moderate. Only slightly uphill, or even level. Pretty small waterfalls throughout the route and beautiful wildflowers this time of year. After the first 7 miles you’ll reach the saddle which is when the trail starts to get steep and rocky. You only have to do this for about a mile winding around a smaller mountain right before the actual peak with the shack on it. Took us about 4 hours up."
155,2018-06-22,[''],"Gorgeous hike yesterday on the Solstice. Not many people, but it was a weekday. Saw lots of beautiful wildflowers, but little wildlife (only birds). Some hikers warned of a very aggressive goat, but we didn’t come across it. There is a lot of shade the first few miles, then none the rest of the way to the top. Still a few moderate snow patches on the trail, but easily got through them with only trail runners (no poles). My puppy loved playing in the snow and waterfall creeks going across the trail a few times. I loved the view from the top! Bring lots of water, snacks and a windbreaker for the top!"
156,2018-06-22,[''],"Recommendation: is to start at the timpooneke trailhead which is the one that is listed as directions from alltrail, since you don't have to worry about trying to cross snowfields as talked about from Aspen grove. Aggressive lone mountain goat beware with dogs or horses. Great views took 3.5 hours to reach the top and 3 hours to go down. 6$ parking fee for a 3 day pass, bring cash. Was not a bad hike at all everyone said it would get steep and I felt like it never did get steep for longer than 5 minutes. The famous local Ben Woolsey just completed  his 957 time to the top today on 6-21. He wants to be over 1,000 by the end of summer"
157,2018-06-21,['hiking'],Challenging but well worth it!
158,2018-06-20,[''],"Beware, there was a lone aggressive mountain goat tonight about half way down the trail, that followed us about 3 miles down, making aggressive gestures. I highly suggest you Google what to do if confronted by a mountain goat before heading up.
other than that, it was fantastic! We saw a bunch of other mountain goats by the summit and toward the top of the trail that were in groups & paid little attention to us. Incredible views & not terribly steep but you notice the lower oxygen high up, more frequent small breaks did the trick though."
159,2018-06-19,['hiking'],"we made the summit last night at about 9pm for the sunset...not a lot of people on the trail...other than crossing over a couple small snow fields that were already tracked out, the trail is clear to the top, no problems..i had trekking poles, buddy did not, and we did just fine...lots of mountain goats along the way and at the top..great hike"
160,2018-06-18,['hiking'],This is a really cool trail and the view from the top was amazing.
161,2018-06-17,[''],Beautiful hike — we saw a mountain goat and a moose!!  Gorgeous wildflowers!!
162,2018-06-11,[''],"Great hike today, a little snow still left on the trail but no gear was needed didn’t even put on my micro spikes. The spot where the snow was still on the trail, we took advantage and slide down for a quick and fun decent. The trail is a long one, bring lots of water. I would recommend a light jacket for the summit it can be cold and windy."
163,2018-06-07,[''],"First timer, and it was everything I had hoped it would be. Ended up getting lost at the 3.6 mile ice field. We hiked in the dark and missed the WATERFALL that the trail goes right past. For other first timers, don’t follow the boot prints and slide marks up the mountain. The first ice field is only 100 feet wide. When you get to it, go straight across it and look for a waterfall. If you go up the ice field more than 100 feet, you will be too high. The upper basin still has plenty of snow, but if you have yaktraks and/or hiking poles you will be okay. I will be doing this again in July when the snow melts. For an added bonus, we ran into Ben Woolsey. Today was his 955 time up Timp. He is looking for #1000 sometime in September."
164,2018-06-07,['hiking'],"Always a lovely jaunt, especially thanks to the wildflowers. Still a bit dicey up high thanks to slick snow. I rather liked having my mountain gear (helmet, yak-trax, ax), but it seems like most people are content to roll the dice with running shoes and little else."
165,2018-06-06,['hiking'],"Beautiful! You hit snow (June 6th) at about 3 miles, but it wasn’t too hard to get over and it was only about every half mile or so. Probably will be gone in a few weeks."
166,2018-06-03,['hiking'],"Started at 4:30am and encountered lots of sketchy icy parts with big snow fields still. First encounter of snow was at 3.5 miles up. Two other groups ahead of us, but they turned around without summiting. We dug out foot holes all the way up to the saddle. No hiking poles and no spikes either. Just some Hoka Speedgoats on. Once to the saddle and can overlook the valley, you have it made. We made it to the top then slid down all the snow. Cut so much time off the decent. With higher temperatures later in the day, the snow fields were softer and melting and no ice. Saw a coyote, marmots, and lots of birds."
167,2018-05-28,[''],"Went up today - lots of snow still. Made it to the meadow below Emerald Lake with my trekking poles and yak trax. A few with more serious gear were going up to at least the saddle, but be prepared for lots of deep snow, some goats down low, and some really slick spots on the way up."
168,2018-05-22,['hiking'],"Awesome view, definitely worth the hike!"
169,2018-05-01,['hiking'],Hi Alyssa. Did you hike Timpooneke to the glacier this year (2018)? I'm looking for a snow report on the Aspen Grove side (your descent).
170,2018-03-15,[''],wide range of things to see. so much fun and by far one of my favorite hikes I've done. I did the glacier and back down the other side so it was a bit longer but absolutely incredible.
171,2018-02-23,['hiking'],"Catching up on some reviews, so note that I did this in early September. I know many people start around 2am to get to the summit at sunrise, but I just wasn't done for that this go around. Started the trail around 7am and got back to the car around 2pm. Lots of people going both directions. The log at the top  was already filled with 200 names, just from that day!! Saw a mother moose and her two babies, as well as a mountain goat. Beautifil wildflowers filled the fields. Great time with some good friends--would definitely recommend doing this one."
172,2018-02-18,[''],"I loved this trail up to the saddle. I must have done it on the busiest weekend of the year so it was a little treacherous actually summiting due to mostly a lot of boys jostling, and the summit itself was very chaotic with lots of people on it. But the part up to that was pretty mellow and had such spectacular views of the wasatch and was lush with flowers. When I do this again, I’ll just go up the the big meadow on the timpooneke side or the emerald lake, once on the summit was enough for me."
173,2018-02-07,[''],I hike this every summer. Top 10 most scenic trails in Utah.
174,2018-01-14,[''],Did this Trail in October. The views are incredible. Each section offers more and more just insanely gorgeous scenery. This hike is steep and long. Be prepared.
175,2017-10-25,['hiking'],"Great hike! Beautiful weather. Did hike 25 October. Some small icy spots lower down but not problematic.  2nd time up, much better experience than the first! Will do again."
176,2017-10-16,['hiking'],"Lovely sunny day. Minimally icy. Summited in 3:35 without pushing too hard. 
Route finding up on to the saddle a mile before summit a bit tricky."
177,2017-10-14,[''],it was actually pretty darn easy. I summited in under 4 hours while going at a slow pace. The neighbor to the north Box Elder peak is by far a harder hike.
178,2017-10-14,['hiking'],Difficult yet rewarding hike.  Best to do this hike in September or October when the temperatures decline.  Bring plenty water and your camera!
179,2017-10-10,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! My husband and I did this hike on October 9th and the fall colors were amazing! We didn't summit because of time constraints, but we made it 5 mi in and 3100 ft up in about 2.5 hours. There was snow and ice on parts of the trail, which was a little nerve wracking because we didn't have crampons and if we had slipped, we could have fallen down a steep slope. We heard from other hikers that the trail is very icy where it splits to the summit. I would definitely recommend crampons. We met Ben on the trail. Super cool guy and he helped us through some of the icy bits."
180,2017-10-07,['hiking'],"Started at 6:00, summitted by 11:00, back down at 3:00. Easy hike to the saddle. From there it gets cold and windy, also more rocky. Very easy to lose the trail, pay close attention to switchbacks. A few scary spots but nothing serious. Bring warm clothes for the top. Super cold. Views are amazing and whole hike is worth it. Met Ben & hiked with him for a mile or two. Awesome guy."

184,2017-09-28,[''],Incredible hike.. 24km round trip... gorgeous all day
185,2017-09-27,[''],Hiked up to to the lake/pond right below the summit. Beautiful views of Pesci canyon below. 3/4 waterfalls on your way up to the top. You'll see mountain goats at the top. I hiked up with a 3 year old in my back back. It was an exhausting day when I finish. Body was absolutely shot.
186,2017-09-21,[''],Long trail but manageable because of the switch backs. The incline is more gradual the trail going up the mountain. Beautiful wild flowers cover most of the trail.  Fortunate enough to see some deer and several mountain goats at the summit. Summit might be confusing. I originally got off the trail and came back down. I then ran into Ben Woolsey (awesome dude) who allowed me to follow him up the mountain. Views from the saddle are amazing but don't stop there. Make sure you go to the summit.  It's totally worth it even if you're a little scared like I was. Find someone to follow up. Take plenty of water (at least 3 liters) and food.  Go on a weekday when it's not super crowded.  I hiked alone and there were plenty of people on the trail.
187,2017-09-20,['hiking'],"difficult, but so worth it. i love starting at night and being up top for sunrise."
188,2017-09-19,['hiking'],Made summit after 3 attempts on Saturday. 5.5 hours up. 4.5 hours back. Parking lot full at 10a. Pretty cold from saddle to summit. Gloves would have helped. But fantastic hike!
189,2017-09-18,[''],"The first 3 miles were simple, Low-grade nothing too crazy, make sure you have waterproof shoes because you cross a few creeks, there really was no steep grades it was pretty much a gradual incline for the whole hike, I only made it to the saddle because my shoes were slick and I didn't trust them to go any further, and I was already wore out and my muscles are still aching 4 hours later. Make sure you have good shoes and if you plan on making the summit bring some type of a pole, there were a few places on the trail where the mud was slick. I started at 7:20 I summitted around 1140 and I was back in my car by 3. I'm 35 and I don't work out at all."
190,2017-09-12,['hiking'],"Started this hike at 1:30 and made it to the summit by sunrise! Me and my boyfriend are in our 20's and exercise regularly, we didn't stop frequently on the way up. It is cold further up! One regret I have is not bringing gloves. We wore ski socks, thermals and hats and felt good. It's cold at the summit so bring a jacket! I had read before not to cross any logs or rock walls in the trail! This is important and saved us several times from getting lost in the dark. If the trail feels wrong, odds are it is! Worth it to summit if you can handle the narrow ridges in the dark. Loved this hike!"
191,2017-09-12,[''],"The views at the top were terrific!! Being as an 18 year old, and havnt exercised in a couple months, i was almost exhausted by the time i got to the top. I wasn't very sure about hiking across all the boulders to get to the saddle, but i made it work! 
A mountain goat came and said hey, and was like 2 feet from me!! 
Overall great hike, and bring plenty of water (I brought 2L, and ran about 45 minutes i reach the bottom coming down) because on your way down, you'll be wanting lots of it! 

Highly Suggest training before by hiking steeper smaller mountains, or getting your leg stamina up. because it'll make your legs feel like the nasty jellow your grandma makes!"
192,2017-09-10,[''],"This hike was actually 17.3 miles RT. Good variety (waterfall, lake, summit). Be careful on the final ascent - steep cliffs and loose rocks. Saw several mountain goat. Unbelievable views."
193,2017-09-09,['hiking'],"Just did this one for the first time since I was a kid today. Pretty hard but super fun. We started at 1am and got to the saddle by sunrise, which was super cool to watch from the top."

195,2017-09-08,[''],"It is very challenging if your not in reasonable shape.  It is worth the hike and challenge though.  Plan on climbing stairs like hiking for miles.  

Keep your eyes out for the goats.  They are all over, way up close to the tops of the peaks."
196,2017-09-06,[''],"Hiked this for the second time on August 27th. Weather was perfect! Started at 4 am with a headlamp. Lots of water to cross in the first mile. I used a trekking pole for balance. The summit was gorgeous with blue skies and very little wind. Saw mountain goats in the high meadow.
It's a long hard hike and by the time I got back to the parking lot my feet were very sore. Used my entire 2.5 liters of water. Be prepared for quick change in weather. As we reached the last half mile it started thundering."
197,2017-09-05,['hiking'],"Great hike! Gradual incline most of the climb up until right before you summit, then it becomes a little steeper for the last 1/2 mile. 3-4 liters of water, a snack, and a jacket for up top are all you'll need. Pack out your trash!! I picked up so much garbage on the way down. Other than the litter on the trail, this is a beautiful hike."
198,2017-09-04,['hiking'],"Took off just after 6 AM this morning, summited by 9:30, spent 30 minutes at the top, and made it back to the trailhead by 1:30 PM. Gorgeous hike, although I would have preferred it to be slightly steeper during the majority of the trail -- the switchbacks seemed extremely long and winding, especially coming back down.

Other than that, gorgeous scenery all the way up, with a stream, wildflowers, wildlife, and, of course, a great view from the top."
199,2017-09-04,['hiking'],The absolutely most beautiful hike I've ever been on...ever! The wild flowers were incredibly beautiful! The hike is long and the part from the saddle to the summit is tough. It's been on my bucket list for many years so it was nice to finally do it! One pet peeve I have is that I saw at least 4 people carrying wildflower bouquets with them down the mountain. If everyone did that there wouldn't be any left to enjoy. Look but don't touch!!!!!
200,2017-09-03,[''],Spectacular!! Hiked it yesterday and the wildflowers were amazing! Very difficult at the top.
201,2017-08-29,['hiking'],"Hiked the Timpooneke trail with a friend yesterday. We are not very fit 40-year-olds who wanted to prove to ourselves that we can do hard things!  We started the hike at 5:45 am, took a couple wrong turns along the way (watch the switchbacks and never walk over a log or small stack of rocks), rested many times, and got to the saddle by noon. We tried to hike up to the summit, but my friend is scared of heights and couldn't handle the steep edges on that portion of the hike. After we ate lunch  and rested for a while, it took us 4 hours to hike back down. Weather was perfect, views were incredible, and I can't wait to do it again. Important items to bring: bug spray (I applied it before leaving so I didn't have to pack it in), sunscreen, at least 3 liters (around 100 ounces) of water, snacks, lunch, toilet paper, hat, light jacket (you can wrap around your waist when it warms up), small flashlight/head lamp. We took a couple ibuprofen before starting the hike and a couple more while at the top. This relaxed our muscles enough that we aren't very sore at all today. When you do the hike, say hello to Ben Woolsey, a 75-year-old man who has done the climb 908 times (as of yesterday). He climbs it 6-8 times a week and can be hired as a tour guide. He was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and in fantastic shape!"
202,2017-08-28,['hiking'],"I've done this hike on the Timpooneke trail many times. This was the first time in quite a few years though. I had one other person in my party. We got to the parking lot around 4:30 am on Sat Aug 26. There were a few parking spots left in the lot so we got lucky. The envelopes and fee box are by the toilets. The fee was $6 for the day. It was 55 degrees and a little breezy. We did not need long sleeves at that time. Went to use the non flush toilet and the men's bathroom was locked with no one in it and the women's toilet had no toilet paper. Luckily someone had some toilet paper left over and a few of use got a few uses out of that. I also had nose tissues I could have used but wanted to save those for the nose. A couple hours in we did not need our headlamps any longer. Got to the saddle around 9:30 am (we are not spring chickens). It wasn't as windy as I've seen in the past. I didn't need long sleeves at all on this hike. The one thing that wind does is keep bugs off. I did not bring any bug spray because of past experiences with the wind, and I wished I had the bug spray. I have a few annoying mosquito bites now. We did not go to the peak because of knees and toes hurting; we headed down around 10 am. We got to the car around 2:15 pm. It was a LONG hike down with toes and knees hurting that entire way. My Fitbit even thought it was super long and clocked me at 18 miles round trip (I believe it's 14 from bottom to peak and back)."
203,2017-08-28,['hiking'],Did this yesterday. Wore a T-shirt and leggings. Brought a windbreaker jacket and a light down jacket. Had about 3 liters of water and I finished it all. We started the hike at 6:02 got to the summit by 10:30. Enjoyed the top and at lunch for about an hour. Perfect weather. Came back down starting around 11:20 and ended back at our car around 4pm. I wasn't anticipating all the loose rocks/gravel but it was amazing and well worth it! Hoping to go again before it gets too cold.
204,2017-08-28,['hiking'],"Got to the trailhead at 3:35 am and was able to find a parking spot. We used headlamps and flashlights for the first few hours until the meadow just below the saddle. Made it to the summit for sunrise but didn't stop too many times on the way up, had to keep moving to make it for sunrise. 

Brought 5 liters of water to be safe but only drank 3.5. 

It was 58 degrees and calm at the trailhead parking lot when we left at 3:35, 47 degrees and windy at the summit at 7 am. Made it back to the trailhead around 10:45 am and it was in the mid 80's. 

You cross 2 or 3 different 'streams' probably a total of 10 times because of switchbacks. We crossed the water by walking across dry rocks, but there was almost no snow melt. I can imagine if the 'stream' was streaming at even a little higher volume that your shoes would get wet some of the times you crossed.

Wildflowers were in full bloom in the meadow under the summit. Really pretty."
205,2017-08-27,['hiking'],One of the most beautiful hikes in Northern Utah.
206,2017-08-26,['hiking'],"Started our ascent at 5:30am this morning. The parking lot was full, we had to park off the road. The hike was BEAUTIFUL! We made it up to the peak and back in just under 8 hours. Spent about 20 minutes at the saddle and 40 minutes at the peak. This might become an annual hike."
207,2017-08-26,['hiking'],"We hiked this trail beginning at 7:00 a.m. finishing at nearly 3:30 p.m. It was challenging and rewarding!!! I chose not to take my smaller dog due to the distance and I think that was a good choice.  Bigger dogs seemed alright and one even hiked the summit! The shell at the summit gave in on me and I slid quite a bit down, not fun, and seemed like it could have been very bad if I had not managed I to catch myself.  I suffered only a few minor cuts and bruises. We saw mountain goats and moose along the way and crossed a few beautiful waterfalls! The view at the top was spectacular and I never wanted to leave."
208,2017-08-26,['backpacking'],"Beautiful but challenging backpacking trip. I took a group from Wasatch Hiking and outdoors last weekend on Friday Aug 18th we camped at the meadow 2.5 miles in. We'd heard from the rangers that at midnight the BYU kids would swamp the trail. We had no idea just how many that'd be, as they summit in order to watch the sunrise in the morning. We hiked into the meadow at least 250 ft in as we'd read from earlier posts that we'd regret the noise from the trail. Thinking we'd be safe further off the trail we were wrong. We slept for 1 hour before the noise from trail started. We'd realized that we were dead center of the meadow and the trail circled us on 3 of 4 sides. The stream of the human BYU train was relentless with lights streaming the trail from their headlamps . Singing yelling ""sweet Caroline "" were non stop. Music stopped talking didn't and yelping. Ever heard of the outdoor code, (respect other campers i.e. Backpacker, hikers) apparently some of these kids missed that from scouts. The next morning we eventually summit but we'll never sleep on this trail again. Especially when the snow melts in summer and the BYU kids do their tradition of the midnight summit!"
209,2017-08-25,[''],We backpacked up to the basin that's located 5.5 miles up. We camped there in the basin overnight and then started the 2 mile ascent to the summit the next day. It's super pretty and this hike provides some amazing views! Be sure to stay on the right path so you don't make this hike longer than it already is.
210,2017-08-25,['backpacking'],I liked about 4 miles the first day and had a wonderful camp out. The next day we left our camp set up and hiked to the top. ( left around 5:30am) It definitely isn't for someone who doesn't like heights but it is beautiful and the hike isn't steep just exposed. Then we hiked to out camp packed it up and hiked to the bottom by around 3:00pm.
211,2017-08-25,[''],"I've done this hike many times and I always really enjoy it (except for one year when I underdressed, but even then it was good). If you go at the right time of year you can see the wildflowers in full bloom in the meadow before the saddle. It's a challenging hike but definitely worth it!"
212,2017-08-24,['hiking'],"We started hiking around 5:30am and it was amazing to watch the sunrise as we hiked. The views were incredible, especially all the wild flowers. We didn't have time to go all the way to the summit, but we watched the solar eclipse from the saddle and it was great. Going back down, the last mile seemed extra long but other than that it really wasn't that difficult of a hike. Just long."
213,2017-08-23,['hiking'],"Started at the base of Timpooneke at 1:45 PM and finished at 10:38 PM. Stayed at the top of the summit for about 40 minutes and slid down the snow field. Very fun and exciting! Beautiful hike at the beginning of August with all of the wild flowers and mountain goats. Be sure to bring the following: Bug spray, flash lights/head lamps, snacks/meal, water, water filter, external charger for phone, and good quality hiking shoes (may get wet in about eight streams that cross the path). 8/12/2017"
214,2017-08-23,['hiking'],"Gorgeous, but crowded."
215,2017-08-21,['hiking'],"Once i came up into the basin i was amazed to see how much further i had to go, lol. I am not ashamed to say that the last mile to the peak kicked my ass! By far the most rewarding hike i have done in a long time. Deer, goats, landscape, were breathtaking and the people i came into contact were wonderful because we all shared some commonality of getting up to that damn peak. This is a must do thing, especially if you live in Utah!  I took 3 Liters of water and had to use my filter on the way down to get more water, so I would recommend either a water filter or packing more water."
216,2017-08-20,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery and wild flowers! Great hike
217,2017-08-20,[''],Awesome hike starting early to be up at top by sunrise.  Beautiful way to start the day.  14.5 miles roundtrip.
218,2017-08-19,[''],thought we didn't reach the top because of health problems it was really fun and prity.
219,2017-08-18,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful! Saw a whole herd of mountain goats! We were surrounded by them! We started the hike at 6am. The trail wasn't that busy until we passed emerald lake. It's a must do in Utah!
220,2017-08-17,[''],loved every minute of it!
221,2017-08-15,[''],"This is my favorite hike, It's so beautiful! if you've never hiked it before and like a good all day hike you have to do it! I like to start at sunrise because the afternoons get hot since you're  in the sun for most of it. There was still a little snow in a couple places but nothing you can't pass through. The meadow is in full bloom and absolutely break taking right now. I feel the best time to hike it is late July - early September. It's definitely a must!"
222,2017-08-14,['hiking'],"No hike like it! Every Utahn that is able should do this hike at least once. This was my first time doing the Timpooneke side and I found it highly preferable to the Aspen Grove side. We started a little after 4 am and it was hard to find parking. All of the parking spots were taken by the sunrise hike crowd, so we had to find a spot on the side of the road outside of the campground. Once we got started it was an awesome time. 

Toward the beginning of the trail you have to cross some streams (which was really fun) so waterproof shoes won't hurt. The hike was beautiful the whole way but once you get to the upper basin where the two trails meet the wildflowers were just absolutely amazing. Even though the trail was very busy this time of year, it was totally worth it to see the wildflowers in their peak. Everything was so lush and green. We only had to cross two very small snow patches, and neither of them were terribly long or worrisome. There was still a lot of snow in the basin on the Aspen grove trail, and I was grateful that I did not have to cross the boulder field in the snow. 

We summited in about 5 hours and completed the entire hike in about 10. We really took our time on the way down because we hiked with someone with knee problems, but we probably could have finished in 9 hours had we hustled. It's very cold on the summit so even though we packed layers to wear, I wish I had gloves for the stretch between the saddle and the summit. We saw about 10 mountain goats coming down the mountain for the morning just above the saddle as we were headed back. It looked like the goats were watching us, one even peaked over a cliff edge to watch us walk down and it was adorable. 

This year we used trekking poles (I don't usually hike with poles) and they made all of the difference, especially on the stretch between the saddle and the summit, they added a lot of stability. The way back was in the sun and had very little shade until the last couple of miles. We tried to start early to avoid hiking in the heat of the day, but in the future I'd want to start even earlier like 2 am. That being said, we brought plenty of water. I'd recommend bringing about 3 liters for this hike.

."
223,2017-08-11,[''],This is one of my all-time favorite trails. Very well graded so that doing 14 miles did not seem that difficult. Incredible views and the hills were thick with wildflowers. Even though there are more waterfalls on the other trail I like this one better. Had no trouble getting parking at 9:30 AM on a Thursday but on Friday the lot was filled at 7 AM.campground next to trailhead is very nice as well. Recommend reservations.
224,2017-08-10,[''],Beautiful Hike! Well worth it!
225,2017-08-06,[''],"Amazing view up top. A little bit of snow left in small sections, but you don't need any gear for the snow."
226,2017-08-06,['backpacking'],Backpacked to Emerald Lake & camped there for the night then summated Mt Timpanogos in the morning. Great hike with beautiful views! Saw lots of mountain goats and a gorgeous sunrise. Definitely for more experienced hikers. Tons of mosquitos so take bug spray!
227,2017-08-05,['backpacking'],"Hiked to the lake on the first day. Made dinner, camped, got chased out by some mountain goats. Summitted on day 2, slid down the glacier rather than hike down. Really fun but also pretty difficult"
228,2017-08-04,['hiking'],"After doing some research I informed my wife that this is one of the busiest, most hiked trails in the state. She asked why; to which I replied, I have no idea. Now I know. It is amazing, challenging, close, beautiful, and full of all sorts of wildlife, flowers, and neat people.  It is like one big sweaty party.

I packed up to the final basin Friday evening where I set up camp in a hammock.  The hike up was amazing.  However the wind in the basin raged all night and I did not sleep a wink.  I suspect that is common for that basin.  I was surprised at how many hikers passed my camp all night long to be at the summit by sunrise.  If I had to guess I would say 200 hikers passed in the dark.  I saw pika in the rock slides, deer, and mountain goats very near the trail, hummingbirds, waterfalls, and fields of amazing flowers.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a great hike."
229,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"Went up the trail 4.3 miles and back. It was absolutely stunning. Water on the trail in a few spots, especially as the day got warmer, so plan on getting your feet wet. Plenty of beautiful waterfalls and miles of wild flowers of every kind in great abundance. Also had to cross two snow banks. Nothing too tough. The climb was steady and gradual. Parking was a bit tight, but had we arrived fifteen minutes later, at 8;30, we would have been able to park right in the parking lot because the first of the ""sunrise on the summit"" crowd was just arriving back at the trailhead and opened up a few spots. Much less crowded than the Aspen Grove trailhead!"
230,2017-07-30,[''],The most difficult trail and most fun I have ever had while hiking. Wild Moose and Mountain Goat. Sliding down snowpack on the way down. we got rained and hailed on in the middle of the summer. It was a super awsome adventure. I'm looking forward to doing in again.
231,2017-07-27,['hiking'],"Trail is mostly open.  There are a few small snow fields.  I would guess that there was about 400-500 ft of hiking in snow to get to the top.  First snow is at about 3.25 miles up, half of these have temporary trails to go around them.  Largest snow field is before the saddle, but a trail is getting worn into the snow pretty well. The snow field at about 3.8 miles up is above a small cliff, make sure to stay higher on it and go above the rock to make it easier."
232,2017-07-27,[''],Beautiful!
233,2017-07-26,['hiking'],Yes planning on a night hike for a sunrise summit with teenage boys. I'm wondering if the hiking conditions are safe for this hike on Saturday?  Any updates would be appreciated!  Thank you.
234,2017-07-24,[''],is the trail good to hike now? I heard there is still lots of snow. not sure what that means.
235,2017-07-23,['hiking'],"Attempted yesterday, but turned back about 4 miles up because I didn't have spikes or poles and I didn't feel comfortable traversing one of the snow fields we encountered. But it was still so worth it. The flowers are gorgeous and everything is so green. Lots of water to trek through right now so you might want some extra socks, but it makes for stunning waterfalls."
236,2017-07-22,['trail running'],"Beautiful. Flowers are not @ their peak, but probably within the next two weeks they'll be popping. So much snow melt= super green and lots of flowing falls."
237,2017-07-18,['backpacking'],It was a very beautiful time of year to go on this hike! Went with a large group!! The rocky paths are difficult on the feet and knees at times. Our goal was to go to the saddle but because of our group size we stopped at one of the larger patches of glacier/snow. It seemed adventurous but a little on the sketchy side.
238,2017-07-17,[''],"Hiked this 2 nights ago. Absolutely beautiful. We started at midnight and it was my first time hiking, so we lost the trail a few times in the dark. There were about 8 snow- fields that we had to cross, but they weren't too bad. I used 2 small sticks to stab into the snow and it helped. During the day, it was very easy to navigate the snow fields. You can slide down one of the glaciers and it was really fun, but I would take one that isn't too bumpy and look out for rocks/sticks poking out of the snow! Be safe, take it slow and you will have a blast!"
239,2017-07-12,['hiking'],"Hiked part way up, still some snow on the trail (starting about 3.5 miles up).  Lots of water this year, so the waterfalls are the best I've seen.  Some flowers are out now, but will be better later in the year."
240,2017-07-09,['backpacking'],"Very Very Beautiful Trail! Forget Me Nots and wild flowers blooming like it is Spring.

Bit of advice. Hike it during the day first time.
As great as it is to hike in the moon light, the trail turns to rivers, and obvious areas are extremely hard to find with all the snow // Melting snow.

Most recently I wore shorts and got 70 new bug bites.. Lost the trail for the last 60% and ended up on a cliff.
As awful as most of it was, the views are incredible. I always want to do it again a few days later. It is addicting.

Overall, the trail is completely different than it is in the fall. Try doing it during the day, so you know the general idea of the trail.

Bug Spray!!

If you are planning on doing this hike, stop planning and get out there! You won't regret it.

Happy Hiking!!"
241,2017-07-09,['trail running'],"Beautiful hike with meadows, snow, great views and waterfalls. Take plenty of sunscreen, as there plenty of stretches without shade."
242,2017-07-04,['hiking'],Still lots of snow.  Not too hard if you have hiking poles. The mountain goats were hiding until around 6pm. Great hike but hard.
243,2017-07-01,['hiking'],Stellar hike. One of the best in Utah for sure!
244,2017-06-30,['trail running'],
245,2017-06-28,['hiking'],"Hiked 6-27-17. Snow starts at mile 3 and doesn't stop until you get to the saddle. Ice axe and light crampons/ spikes are highly recommended. Also use lots of sunscreen (we hadn't fully intended to summit but ended up being out 9 hours and I'm paying for it today) You will definitely want to have a GPS with the trail loaded onto it. We found it was generally easier to try and stay over top of the trail (because it is covered in snow, you get it). This lets you clear some of the cliff bands other terrain obstacles more easily. The push up the saddle is doable but rough. I would recommend after clearing the first cliff band by staying with the trail that you stay low instead of trying to diagonal your way up to the saddle. Find a straight up hill shot at the saddle and work your way that way. It was a long hard day but doable if you are committed, take you time to pick your route and consult your GPS often to stay on track. Its going to be late July to mid August until you can do this without wanting ice gear. I'll try and load my track so you can see how we approached it. Hard but fulfilling day hike this time of year."
246,2017-06-28,[''],Lots of snow starting at mile 3. I had to turn around at mile 4 because of the amount of snow.
247,2017-06-27,['hiking'],"Amazing. The trail starts to get populated at Emerald Lake, as it's a great place to take a break, and continues up the mountain to the peak. If you're lucky you'll get to see mountain goats like I did!"
248,2017-06-25,['hiking'],"I tried to summit this past weekend, but there was too much snow. At mile 3 the steep snow/ice starts. I was only able to make a mile hiking on the ice before it was too dangerous. if you have crampons, the right amount of adventurous spirit, then you could summit, otherwise I would wait a couple more weeks. watch out for aggressive mnt goats. I had a confrontation with one yesterday that was trying to stir up some trouble with me."
249,2017-06-23,[''],"Great hike, great views. It's not as steep as everyone says it is. One of my favorites."
250,2017-06-23,[''],Has anyone hiked this who is age 60+? Would it be doable for a fit 64 year old man who has had ankle and knee surgeries? My husband and I are hoping to go with my dad this summer.
251,2017-06-23,[''],Amazing trail trying to do it this year but looking for trail conditions. Anyone been up there recently? What's the snow looking like?
252,2017-06-20,['hiking'],Any update on conditions?
253,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"It's long, it's hard, it's tough which made it a huge accomplishment. Did this last Sept and plan on making it an annual hike."
254,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Has anyone attempted to go up to the Summitt?  I tried about a week ago and the snow on the upper portions made it very dangerous/ difficult

Thanks!!"
255,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"Great hike. It was amazing, but I don't think my body was ready for how strenuous it was. Made it to the saddle and was unable to continue on and go to the shed as I got altitude sickness. Definitely worth the hip pain and blisters though. I'd recommend hiking poles if you don't have them already."
256,2017-06-08,['hiking'],"Made it up through the basin to were the trail starts going back up the mountain. Even with my snowshoes it was very difficult to traverse across the steep snow covered inclines. Really difficult to stay on the trail and didnt want to risk slipping off one of those cliffs! Regardless, its still an absolute gorgeous hike up there."
257,2017-06-07,['trail running'],My favorite hike in Utah. Mostly runnable and absolutely gorgeous the whole way. A must hike for the area.
258,2017-06-01,['hiking'],A lot of snow about two miles in. Hard to cross the snow fields without snowshoes or crampons
259,2017-05-28,[''],Loved it!!
260,2017-04-30,[''],Jon you can hike here next weekend but if you want to make the summit you'll have to wait until the end of July or even August. I  crossed a large snowfield near the saddle two years ago in mid August.
261,2017-04-22,['hiking'],As of 4-22-17 is this trail hikable? Do you need snowshoes or any other equipment? Looking at hiking this next weekend.
262,2017-04-19,['backpacking'],Love this hike. I have hiked this twice - the first time starting at 1:30 in the morning and getting to the summit for sunrise. The second time we brought in a tent and camped in the valley before the final ascent and finished in the morning. The trail can be tough on soft shoes - I recommend a harder sole for walking on the rocks. I plan on doing this again (at least once a year).
263,2017-04-09,['hiking'],Excellent trail. We even found a monarch butterfly at the summit. The mountain goats were very used to us. I wish we spent more time on the mountain. We got a late start and finished in the dark. My gps gave us a little more distance than 14.5mi. I got 17.2 from my Garmin on the trip. It did take a little longer than we hoped and finding a spot to park was rough. The trip was worth it!!
264,2017-04-05,['hiking'],This was a beautiful hike.  I hadn't been hiking for a long time and was still able to make it up and back in an reasonable time.
265,2017-03-31,['hiking'],Gorgeous views. Outstanding. Really wish I hadn't waited so long to do this hike.
266,2017-03-24,[''],I have done both timp trails. They are beautiful and fully worth the effort
267,2017-03-13,[''],It was a good hike long and hard at times but totally worth it in the end!!!
268,2017-01-29,['hiking'],"This is the most beautiful and rewarding hike I've ever done.  The wildflowers are stunning in July, and you can't beat the views from the top.  I loved seeing the mountain goats."
269,2017-01-08,[''],"BEAT.  

So much fun"
270,2016-12-19,[''],The large meadow Below the summit is beautiful with its wide open views and wild flowers.
271,2016-11-09,[''],It was difficult at parts but one of the most beautiful Trails I've ever been on. I would recommend this Trail to anyone. I would recommend that you at least make it to the saddle if nothing else.
272,2016-10-26,[''],Did this hike September 28th and there was lots of snow in the bowl. A beautiful hike. We started at 8am and finished at 6pm with breaks. Only made it to the bowl because the summit was too covered in snow. A total of 13 miles for us. I will definitely be back next summer to finish :)
273,2016-10-20,['hiking'],"Rated 5 stars by far. So amazing. There is so much to see and amazing views the whole way. Does not feel as long as it really is because it is so beautiful. I would highly recommend going all the way up to the summit. DO NOT STOP AT THE SADDLE. If you already go that far, you might as well go all the way and sign the registry and see everything you can. It is very windy towards the summit but there are nice places to sit near the saddle where the wind doesn't hit you. After reading other reviews, I think we got pretty lucky because there was only one other person up at the summit when we got there and we stayed for a good half hour. Also did not pass many people on the way up which was weird because it was a perfect day. We saw more people going up as we were coming down at night around 8pm. We started in the afternoon and the hike took us 8 and a half hours. We never ran and took lots of breaks. Fitbit says I burned 3067 calories which I will take."
274,2016-10-17,['hiking'],"Bring gloves in October. Perfectly still first 6 miles to the saddle, then 70 mph wind gusts!"
275,2016-10-09,[''],"We hiked this for the first time 2 days ago. Amazing hike! Steady climb but nothing too steep. We read up a lot on it and went well prepared. Started early, the temp was cool but pleasant. Took a few layers off as the day warmed up. By the upper bowl we were putting some layers back on. There was a fair amount of snow along the ridge line and up to the summit. A storm blew in and the temps changed quickly and drastically at the top. It dropped to below freezing and clouds were too thick to see any view from the tower. Our water bottles started to freeze up. All of our gear was sufficient with the exception of our gloves. I've never had my hands get that cold that fast. We did use our ice cleats for the descent. Overall a fantastic hike! Go prepared for anything! We will definitely tackle it in the spring again. Hopefully we'll get to see the view!"
276,2016-10-02,[''],"I hiked this yesterday and let me just tell you- it was the most rewarding feeling to accomplish. My group each brought 2 extra coats and a pair of hand gloves just in case. By the end of the hike we used everything we brought with us. The hike was very snowy once we reached the meadow but we were able to make it through-steep and a little bit muddy in some areas but as we got to the top surprisingly it wasn't too bad. Getting to the shack and seeing the view was worth every minute, make sure you wear a good pair of actual hiking boots on this one."
277,2016-09-19,['hiking'],One of my favorite hike in Utah.
278,2016-09-19,[''],Very challenging hike with beautiful views.
279,2016-09-12,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail on Saturday, arrived at the parking lot at 4:30am and it was completely full. We started hiking around 5am and reached the summit a little before 9am. The trail has amazing sights the whole way to and from the summit, with an especially stunning view once you reach the saddle. My only complaint with this trail and it has nothing to do with the trail but the people hiking it... No one has any type of trail etiquette! The trail is single track most of the way and instead of letting hikers on their way up pass through first everyone just pushes on and tries to squeeze by at once. I can't tell you how many times I got bumped, shoved, and stepped in front of while on the way to the summit without any sort of ""excuse me"" or even a ""hello"". I'm 29 yrs old and in pretty good shape so it doesn't affect me in any way other than irritate me but when I see people push past a mom while she is carrying a newborn on her back it's infuriating. I honestly think it's pure ignorance rather than rudeness, and luckily the views from the top make up for it but  be prepared for inconsiderate hikers."
280,2016-09-11,['hiking'],"Started at 2AM got up around 5AM. Just when you think you're almost to the top it just keeps going. Dress warm for the top if you're planning on sunrise. Windy and not a lot of cover at the ridge. Breathtaking views, lots of wildlife, and well maintained paths."
281,2016-09-11,[''],"Absolutely beautiful trail. Also brutally difficult, but that's likely just from spending several days prior wandering around the Uintas and two days prior to that driving from Miami. Some octogenarian couple was managing it easily, and I'm 27, so yeah, probably overstating the difficulty a bit. Stunning scenery through and through though."
282,2016-09-11,[''],incredibly beautiful. Very crowded on a Saturday morning in September.
283,2016-09-11,['hiking'],I love this hike! It's beautiful and has a few different routes to the top. It's a solid day hike so be sure to start early and bring enough food and equipment to stay dry and safe. The view at the top is unbelievable.
284,2016-09-11,['hiking'],"great hike. definitely intense at the last mile up to the shack, but the view out made it worth it. some rock hiking. we made it up and back in less than 8 hours. the cradles view is gorgeous."
285,2016-09-11,[''],"Fun hike. Cold at the top, make sure you have a jacket. Not a hard hike it's just long."
286,2016-09-06,['hiking'],"We started at about 5:30am, summited at 10am with a few stops to eat and rest. We went on Labor Day 2016 and it was crazy busy so we didn't get to park in the parking lot and we were slowed down a bit with the narrow trail and letting people by coming down. Overall, very fun and beautiful. Very sore the next day. Great hike."
287,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Did this Sunday on Labor Day Weekend.  Started at 6:45am.  I am not in the best of shape, but after some second thoughts and lots of breaks we made the saddle about noon.  After a quick lunch I had the energy to make it to the top.  The part from the saddle to the top was very windy and cold.  I would estimate 40 mph winds with gusts much higher, which made the last 3/4 of a mile a bit nerve racking.  

The way down wasn't too bad.  About halfway down we had a run in with a very large mountain goat that was laying on the trail.  He wasnt happy with us being there.  A short detour above him through a rock slide area and we were back on the way.  Whole trip lasted about 10.5 hours.  Still with the bitter cold wind at the top and very sore feet and legs at the bottom it was worth it 100%.  Cant wait to go again."
288,2016-09-04,['hiking'],"Sunrise summit hike - parking lot at 1:30 am was 3/4 full but we heard it was a very busy weekend. Last weekend before school started.  Hike was nice  and early morning made it very cool. Beautiful view seeing 10-15 other hiking parties with head lamps trekking up the trail above. Truly stunning. 

Nice pace, got to the summit at 5:30 after being delayed at the top meadow. Make sure you stay to the right when the trail forks-we missed the sign and went across the meadow towards emerald lake and had to cut back across a rock fall that was very difficult and steep. 

Back to parking lot I. About 2 hours. Back in bed by 11:00. Amazing day."
289,2016-09-04,[''],Do this over the Aspen Grove side imo
290,2016-09-03,['hiking'],Awesome Hike!  Views were incredible!  Worth getting to the summit!  I think it is best to get there for sunset as it also gives views of the valley lit up at night after the sun goes down.
291,2016-09-02,['hiking'],"I did this with my wife and 13 year old daughter on July 23rd.  If you're outside Utah, you may not know that July 24th is a holiday (Pioneer Day), so the trail was very, very crowded.  Parking was absolutely atrocious!  We were forced to park off the road in the brush about a mile away (no exaggeration) because there was nothing closer.  We passed about 75 trail runners coming down as we were on the way up, and I don't know how many hundreds of hikers.

Those were the negatives.  Despite all that, my wife and I really enjoyed the hike.  Our girl thought several times that she was going to die on the mountain, but this was her first hike over 4 miles long.  The hike really isn't ever that steep until you are past the saddle on your way to the summit.  It's just very long.  The views are amazing on the way up and amazing again once you get to the saddle and can see into Utah Valley.  The flowers were fantastic, although I think they had probably peaked a week or two before we came up.  The highlight of our hike was the group of mountain goats that were literally about 10 feet off the trail.  We got some amazing pictures of them.

Nearly all of the trail is exposed to the sun, so be sure to bring sunscreen, a hat, and plenty to drink.  There are some streams to filter water from on the way up, and a person could take a side trip to Emerald Lake near the saddle for water too.  We were lucky and there was a melting snow field right near the saddle that we refilled our water bottles at on the way down.  I think I ended up drinking 4 liters during the whole hike and probably should have had one more.  Also, plan on bringing plenty of snacks.  On a longer hike like this, you don't want your energy reserves depleted before you get to the saddle or you'll do what many people do and quit there only 3/4 of a mile from the peak.

292,2016-09-01,[''],"Absolutely beautiful, but crowded with little parking. Also, narrow for the amount of traffic, and lots of stinging nettle."
293,2016-09-01,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike with a gradual incline. Fairly long, but the views from the saddle and the summit are well worth it."
294,2016-08-30,['hiking'],I liked it quite a bit. I was 10 when I did it a few years ago so it was tough. But overall a very cool hike.
295,2016-08-29,[''],
296,2016-08-28,[''],"Great hike.  Great views. The mountain goats were cool.  The last stretch from saddle to peak is difficult but worth the effort.  Be careful on this section.

 The whole trail was so crowded with people though, which admittedly was partly my fault going on a Saturday.  I prefer a little more solitude with my hikes.   We had to park away from the trailhead.  We lucked out and found a spot that only added maybe a half mile to our hike.  Others weren't so lucky."
297,2016-08-28,['hiking'],One of my favorite trails.  Go on a weekday if at all possible as the weekends are extremely trafficked. Almost all the wild flowers are gone now and fall colors are starting to set in.  We saw a heard of about 40 mountain goats on the mountainside and another 20+ scattered near the trail just below the saddle.
298,2016-08-28,['hiking'],"Wonderful sufferfest, totally worth the distance, the cold, and the droves of people. Plus it's like a Utah resident, right of passage. Even though we started the hike at 1am the parking lot was nearly full and the trail very busy, maybe just because it was the weekend (Saturday morning) or maybe just because the trail is popular. The sunrise started at around 6am up there and we made it to the peak at 5:30am, pretty good timing but we would have preferred even better timing since it was freezing on top and we didn't layer up enough for just sitting around on the cold stone. There were tons of mountain goats in the basin and they're not scared of people so be scared of them. Also, don't stop at the saddle you crazies! Summit that shiz!"
299,2016-08-26,[''],"I LOVED this hike! It's has it all: Gorgeous scenery, waterfalls, challenge, distance, panoramic views, scrambling, and a very rewarding finish--you really WORK for that view! It was honestly incredible!"
300,2016-08-23,['backpacking'],Difficult hike. Backpacked up to Emerald Lake and set up camp...that in itself was a haul but had to get to the summit as well. Hiking up to the saddle from the East takes you across a vague talus trail and a pretty step section right below the saddle. View from the saddle is pretty great and would certainly be a good stopping point for many hikers. From the saddle to the summit is longer than it looks. That last section is not trivial but can be done if you are careful and pay attention. Views from the summit are pretty awesome! TONS of mountain goats which was really neat. Several at the saddle and a bunch were at Emerald Lake in the morning. Cool drinking coffee with a mom and her kids in your camp!
301,2016-08-21,['hiking'],HARD. Started at 3pm and came to the meadows as the sky started to turn colors and lighten. We got to the summit right at 6:40 as the sun peeked out. Such an amazing experience. The way down is super long and hard!
302,2016-08-18,['hiking'],"Completed this Trail a couple of weeks ago and WOW the Wildflowers :) Made it all the way to the Summit, and every view was worth it"
303,2016-08-16,['hiking'],"Started hiking at 2:45 a.m. and reached the peak at 6:15 in time to watch sunrise. Took headlamps, warm clothes, and plenty of water. The last part of the hike after leaving the saddle was pretty scary in the dark. Coming down in daylight was a lot better. Wildflowers were beautiful! Saw a moose and a mountain goat. Beautiful views of Utah county, Wasatch range, and Deer Creek Reservoir. Because we left so early it never got very hot. Good hike.  Long and hard at times. Definitely will do it again!!"
304,2016-08-14,['hiking'],Mind the trail markers. Bring lots of water and a good friend.
305,2016-08-13,[''],Great hike--flowers everywhere late July and early August. Need a light jacket at the top.
306,2016-08-12,[''],"Loved this trail, left at 10Pm and made it to the top in time to see the sunrise!"
307,2016-08-09,['hiking'],"Completed hike 8/2/16.  Beautiful scenery with lots of wild flowers . Trail well marked.  Recommend early sunrise start in summer to avoid mid day heat. We made it up 2:58 and down 2:30 which is not bad for 2 hikers in relatively good shape living at sea level on gulf coast.  Completed aspen grove trail 2 years ago and while both routes are equally scenic, I prefer the Timpooneke trail as the section below the saddle is less steep with better footing."
308,2016-08-06,[''],Great hike to go with friends. Well worth the struggles even if you get off trail like I did.
309,2016-08-04,['hiking'],Just completed this hike for the first time last weekend. Amazing views! Stunning windflowers in the alpine meadows! Always fun to hike along the trail with a pair of mountain goats ahead of you. Will do it again!
310,2016-08-03,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. So many wild flowers and epic views to enjoy. Push yourself to summit, it is a rush to be at the top of the truly epic and iconic mountain in Utah. The trail gets tough in parts and it helps if you start in the middle of the night. 2am is a good time and puts you in a position where most of the hike is done without the sun and heat of the day."
311,2016-07-30,['backpacking'],"We went up on a Thursday and had no problem finding the ideal camping spot and water at Emerald Lake.  I did the sunrise summit solo and it was the most challenging thing I've ever done.  A little too dangerous IMO because of the cliffs, altitude and rocks in the dark.  Would I do it again? No. Am I glad I did it? Yes.  It was a memorable birthday."
312,2016-07-30,['hiking'],"Amazing views, friendly people and wildlife! Will definitely be coming back again and again for this manageable challenge."
313,2016-07-25,[''],"views...goats...Wild flowers ...AMAZING...
bring lots of water....and good shoes!!!"
314,2016-07-25,['backpacking'],"I backpacked up to Emerald Lake and stayed the night with my dog. I think this is a great trail to take your dog for their first overnight wilderness trip, because it is so popular. So the majority of the large predators are scared away from all of the traffic along the trail. make sure you bring water and a water filter, because there are some hot and dry stretches along the trail. also be prepared to possibly carry your dog if the ground is too hot for his paws. the majority of the trail is shaded, but like I said before there is about an hour-and-a-half stretch that is exposed and very hot."
315,2016-07-24,[''],"I ran to the peak and back in just under 4hrs. I did spend 45 minutes at the top to enjoy the view. Overall a very strenous hike, however I made good time with the running. Will definitely be going back up again."
316,2016-07-23,[''],"what a day for a hike. 102 in the valley, beautiful up here. active rock movement  today. be careful"
317,2016-07-21,['hiking'],"July 17/18. We went up Timpanooke and down Aspen Grove. First day went up and camped in the meadow just below the summit trail start. I'm not in good shape at all and overweight, but going slow and camping before making the summit made it so I was able to summit. Summited on day 2 and down aspen. I will never ever go down Aspen (or up really) again. The trail is much harder on weak knees than Timpanooke was. 

I'm living proof that if you go slow, anyone can make it up this. Flowers were stunning. We had a scary run in with a goat when we turned a corner and he was right there. I guess we scared him too when he started bluff charging. Sore for two days after but I'm super glad I pushed myself up this!"
318,2016-07-20,[''],"I can't believe the wildflowers this year! Amazing. We saw several mountain goats and a deer as well. This is a LONG hike. Took us about 8 hours round trip which seemed pretty average.  we were a little faster than some and a little slower than others.  A lot of people get to the saddle, enjoy the view and turn around but I recommend braving the last stretch to the summit. it's a little scary because the trail is narrow on a steep cliff so might not be great for young kids...or planning holding their hand a lot of the way. Feels great to reach the top! Beautiful scenery the whole way."
319,2016-07-20,['hiking'],"Pretty strenuous going up hill, but views and scenery are amazing! Also lots of fun to run down the mountain!"
320,2016-07-19,[''],"Beware of the one-horned mountain goat. Coming down from the saddle he was actually following me! 

When I lived in Utah I'd do this hike several times each summer. Now living in Phoenix I only get to do it once a year. It is always incredible. 

The last part of the trek from the saddle to the top is pretty brutal if you aren't used to the elevation. There is a lot of climbing up and over rocks. Maybe I'm just getting old but I wish I had brought walking sticks with me this year! 

Put on lots of sunscreen. The sunburns that bloom on this hike are horrendous.

The wild flowers were in full bloom."
321,2016-07-17,[''],"We love this hike! We always do a loop, and shuttle a car! We go up Timpanookee, slide down the glacier and go down Aspen grove! Amazing!"
322,2016-07-16,['hiking'],"July 15, 2016. We saw spectacular wild flowers along the trail, and the mountain goats are great!"
323,2016-07-16,['hiking'],"This trail is absolutely beautiful! Climb up to the cirque gets tiring but so worth it. Tons of wildflowers all over. After the climb from the saddle, I started feeling the elevation and got a bit slow, but it was very worth it to make it to the survey hut. 2 small snow patches right below the saddle that you have to cross, but they're no big deal at all."
324,2016-07-16,['hiking'],amazing views as one hikes thru 3 consecutively higher bowls- each one different look entirely.
325,2016-07-12,['hiking'],"Just got back from doing this trail as opposed to the Aspen Grove trail which I've done a few times.  It's still pretty cold at the summit and before the sun comes out so bring a jacket.  

If you're deciding between the two trails, I'd suggest it's a question of whether you prefer wildflowers or waterfalls on your hike.  Timpanooeke for wildflowers and aspen grove for waterfalls.  Great time and great hike."
326,2016-07-10,['hiking'],Wasn't too steep. Just long.
327,2016-07-09,[''],"Not very steep or difficult, just long! Definitely worth it though, every step of the way was beautiful! Next time I go I may camp at the top, coming back down was a little hard on my knees to do it all in one day."
328,2016-07-06,['hiking'],"Fantastic trail with a stunning view at the summit.  Give yourself plenty of time - it's a 4,350' elevation gain and the air is thin at the top.  But it's definitely worth the effort.  Gorgeous!"
329,2016-07-05,['backpacking'],
330,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Great hike, beautiful views, only downside was how heavily trafficked this trail was. Definitely worth the climb!"
331,2016-07-02,['trail running'],Done this trail to the summit and back about 300 times. A classic.  Any round trip time under 3.5 hours is stout; break 3 hours and you've got Wasatch bragging rights.  Say hi to the goats!
332,2016-07-01,[''],"Fun hike especially if you want to backpack somewhere for the weekend, but it is highly trafficked."
333,2016-07-01,['hiking'],Amazing hike! Not for the faint of heart. will take 5 to 8 hours at least.
334,2016-06-30,[''],A gem to our community.
335,2016-06-27,['hiking'],Do it !
336,2016-06-25,[''],One of the best hikes in Utah
337,2016-06-20,[''],Gorgeous hike! The elevation gain is slow and steady which makes the hike nice and relaxing. The waterfalls were plentiful and fun to see. I will definitely be doing this hike again.
338,2016-06-20,['hiking'],Awesome hike
339,2016-06-12,[''],"Great trail, a nice walk in the summer, and if you want a challenge try it in the spring with the snow. Choose a day with no cloud coverage to ensure you get the view from the top!"
340,2016-06-06,[''],Beautiful all year but the best in early July while the flowers are blooming still.
341,2016-05-24,[''],Did this one twice. Made it to the top both times. Second time it was really windy up there. Adds a little adrenaline. Love this hike. Would do it again and again
342,2016-05-21,['camping'],I love this trail and try to hike it at least once a year. The view from the top is beautiful and well worth the effort. Mount Timponogus is an amazing mountain.
343,2016-05-19,[''],awesome views
344,2015-10-25,[''],"It took us 5 hours to get there and 4 to get back. It was a little more difficult than we were expecting, and the trail doesn't have very good signs for it, we almost took the wrong turn a couple of times. But it was still fun and got to see beautiful scenery"
345,2015-10-25,[''],Good trail very on the weekend and holiday
346,2015-10-14,['hiking'],"After early light began to dance upon the mountains my heart wondered why haven't I hiked this trail before.  I'm not a runner but am in trail shape.  I made it to the summit in 2 hours and 45 minutes.  Yes, I hike without breaks.  One spends time hiking around cliff bands up to the last one when  one climbs through a short chute.  This is a very busy trail.  Ham radio operators, take a mobile with you!"
347,2015-09-17,[''],"Someone gave this hike three stars. Come on Nature, you're not good enough!"
348,2015-09-14,['hiking'],"Great Hike,   Arrived at the trailhead at 5am on Saturday.  Only 6 spots were available.   Saturdays are very busy.  The hike up is great,  the lower part of the trail had many water sources to filter from.  After just a couple of miles there is no water available until Emerald Lake.   Camped in the Timpanogos basin, spent the rest of the day exploring the area and watching the HUGE crowds going up.  Awoke early Sunday to climb to the summit.  Much more enjoyable on Sunday.  Not nearly as many people.  Dont underestimate the distance or your need for water."
349,2015-09-09,['hiking'],Potential for more stars if done in the middle of the week perhaps. It is a very popular hike so the weekend on a full moon (Which ther night thing was a great experience) was very very very crowded.We started our hike at 1AM and the parking lot was 3/4's full. The sunrise and views are worth the climb.
350,2015-09-04,['hiking'],"The route is probably a bit less than 15 miles round trip. Horses might be present. Remember to have money for the fee the Forest Service charges. Get there quite early on a weekend or there won't be parking. Hiking in June is definitely dangerous; that's often true in November also. Many people underestimate this hike--look at a thorough description of it, such as on the Hiking Mount Timpanogos Safely web page, before heading up."
351,2015-09-01,['hiking'],Seriously awesome!
352,2015-08-24,['hiking'],"TG - Hiked Timp Saturday via Timpanooke.  Great hike, lots of hikers which was no problem and what we expected.  Parking was a joke.  know if you go on a weekend and park outside the designated parking lot, which fills up with the night hikers, be prepared for a ticket or your car to be towed.  We were told they randomly pick cars to tow that are not in the parking lot."
353,2015-08-22,['hiking'],Awesome hike. Offers awesome scenery the whole way and beautiful views at the summit. Long and the trail at times get a bit rocky so wear hiking shoes. Saw family of mt. Goats on trail last time.
354,2015-08-18,[''],"honestly, I think that this hike is a bit overrated. yes, it is a good hike with great views but there are many other hikes that are comparable without ask the crowds. worth doing once though."
355,2015-08-12,['hiking'],We hiked up on a Friday at about 5pm and camped in a meadow. We turned right at the toilet sign and hiked past the toilet to a secluded meadow away from any hikers. I didn't think it was too cold but a sleeping bag was definitely needed. Then we woke up at 4am to pack up our camp and hike to the top to see the sunrise. Seeing the sunrise on the top is amazing! I would recommend it. After we stayed up there for a bit we hiked out and were down by 12pm. The hike was challenging at times but not the hardest I've ever done.
356,2015-08-10,['hiking'],"We started this hike around 1 am Sunday morning.  I'm guessing because of the rain there were very few other people on the trail. it took us about 5 hours to summit. This hike is amazing! And as others have said, the wildflowers are in full bloom. Even in the dark with my headlamp I could see how great they are! if you can make that last push do the summit! It's so worth it. Just be prepared for scrambling and lots of loose rock!"
357,2015-08-08,['hiking'],So many wildflowers! It was beautiful. Started hiking about 6:00AM...took a lot of breaks on the way up. We got to meet Ben Woosley on his 707th summit! Inspiring! We went to the saddle and ate lunch there. We made it back by 3:45. Saw a few mountain goats hopping around on some cliffs. In my opinion this is definitely the easier route. I took 2L of water and a gatorade which was the perfect amount for me.
358,2015-08-04,['hiking'],"This is a great hike! In my opinion, the Timpooneke Trail to Mount Timpanogos is more pleasant than the Aspen Grove Trail. This trail starts at a higher elevation so it's not as steep as Aspen Grove, but it's a little longer. Both trails meet up as the Timpanogos saddle and then take the same path to the summit. 

Both trails commonly have upwards of one hundred hikers on mid to late summer weekends. Several hikers like to hike through the night to catch the sunrise at the summit.  I prefer to start at first light so I can spot wildlife and hit the summit and come back by mid-afternoon. 

I've hiked both trails, and I prefer Timpooneke over Aspen Grove because of the elevation difference and because I think it is a prettier hike. This trail won't take you to Emerald Lake, but you can easily add that onto your trip plans if you'd like.

359,2015-08-04,['hiking'],I'd definitely recommend starting this hike in the early AM to see the sunrise and also to beat the heat. The view was incredible but the hike itself was not enjoyable. It seemed never ending. It's definitely a once in a lifetime hike for me but it was a must! Now I can say I did it!
360,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! We started at 1 AM and I am glad we did. The 7.5 mile hike up there is challenging enough, it would have been ridiculously challenging in the heat. We came down around 11 and it was getting pretty hot. There are lots of things to see. We got to see some mountain goats. The wildflowers are in bloom right now. There is a small waterfall at the bottom. The views from the top are amazing. Everyone should go all the way to the top to get the full experience as well as sign the log book they have up there. Challenging hike and rewarding experience!"
361,2015-08-01,['hiking'],"Essential for anyone living in the area to do at least once. Highly recommended to do at night and see the valley lit up, and wait for sunrise.

Took us almost five hours up, and maybe 3-4 back down

Parking at timpinooke is very limited

This is an extremely popular hike. There was likely nearly s hundred people at the top for sunrise"
362,2015-08-01,['bird watching'],"I really enjoyed the hike up and back. We did it under the blue moon so we didn't need our headlamps most of the night which was cool. We saw 4 deer as we hiked. We made it to the saddle around 3:30 am took a good look at the beautiful valley below then made our way to the top around 5:19 am There was so many people along the trail and at the top of the mountain for sunrise. It was 100% worth it. I recommend it. 

My biggest problem was the trash along the trail, as well as the presence of human waste along the trail. Literally along the trail people used the bathroom?  Are you kidding me? That is not cool at all. Take a bag and poop there then carry it out. 

Otherwise, great hike!"
363,2015-07-31,[''],"I did this hike late July. I saw a lot of flowers—more as I went higher, especially at the basin. It was difficult for me, but I'm not in great shape. I made it to the basin, then went down. I rate it high because of the variety of views and the many flowers, but not higher because I didn't get much of a payoff at the top of my hike."
364,2015-07-30,['hiking'],"I love this hike, it was very difficult for me being almost 400 lbs with gear on. It took me 10 hours to reach the Meadow or the Timpanogos Basin (~6 mile point), I started past the meadow about a half mile but decided to turn back to allow myself time to descend in daylight (I prefer hiking up at night hours, NEVER DOWN).
All along the way I was just enthralled by the views and beautiful falls and wild flowers. I have never done a hike like this and at this altitude but I am so glad I did. After hiking past the first crest (3 mile point) I was followed by a dear that was not afraid and allowed to take pictures. The hike is really not difficult the only challenge for me was my severe weight and lack of fitness. I could not of made it without my Wal-Mart hiking poles and compression suit. I had a 3 liter hydration pack that only lasted me until the 9 mile point (the first crest area). If I were to do this again I will definitely work on my fitness (I'd say weight but I'd be lying) I will backpack in the Meadow before the first crest or at the Timpanogos basin and ascend the summit the next day. This is my most favorite hike ever so far. I plant to do Half Dome next month and I will definitely be in line to score a wilderness pass and hike the day before attempting to summit the Sub dome and Half dome.

Forgot to mention ascending up at night is freezing (I hiked this is late July), bring gloves and hand warmers if needed and wear layers to keep you warm."
365,2015-07-23,['hiking'],"Of the two approaches to Timpanogos summit, this one is by far the easier route. It's much more gradual, and never really becomes difficult until you reach near the summit. 
During the summer, the wildflowers are absolutely spectacular, especially in Timpanogos Basin. 
There is water available in many access points along the hike, and we found that the runoff was following the trail quite frequently along the first few miles of the hike. However, this year in July, Scout falls was basically a trickle and wasn't spectacular. 
As others have probably mentioned, get there early. Parking is awful, and even if you get there early on a Saturday, you may not get a spot from all the people summiting at night to see the sunrise from the top. Expect not to get a spot so you don't arrive disappointed."
366,2015-07-21,[''],"Great hike! Beautiful views the whole way up, so even a partial hike would be worth your time. The summit can be very cold though, so bring warm gear. 

Also, the 10 hour estimate on this site is quite slow. We finished in about 6-7 hours. Make sure to come early, because parking is terrible."
367,2015-07-19,[''],Long but the view from the top is awesome!
368,2015-07-19,['walking'],"My hike was actually from the Aspen Grove side, but I can't locate that on this site, so here it is in my Blog. http://coreykopischke.blogspot.com/2015/07/they-call-it-timp.html
Enjoy!"
369,2015-07-19,['hiking'],The variety of terrain on Timp is lovely and keeps it interesting. My son and I only went as far as the basin and counted it as scouting for a future backpacking trip. I'd rather camp and summit the second day. 10 hours of vertical hiking in one day is too much for some people's old bodies! ;)
370,2015-06-22,['hiking'],"My favorite Utah hike yet.  I felt like I was on an episode of National Geographic as I came across the Talus Field and saw Timp in the distance.  Long distance to hike but absolutely worth it.  

I shared some trail details and pictures on my blog!

371,2015-05-08,['hiking'],"Great hike. It is less steep than the Aspen Grove route, but it takes a little longer and Emerald Lake is not on the way. Personally, I prefer to go the Aspen Grove route, but to each their own."
372,2015-03-20,['hiking'],"Despite the crowds this is still one of the prettiest hikes in the entire Wasatch. It's not insanely steep, but the elevation gain is constant and unrelenting. I recommend doing the hike on a weekday to avoid the crowds."
373,2014-10-05,[''],"Beautiful trail but rocky at the end. We saw moose and deer. When you reach to the peak, there is a shelter where u can register yourself on the log book"
374,2014-08-31,['hiking'],"Just finished this hike for the first time today! I. am. exhausted. Beautiful trail, but I really didn't like the part of the trail when it was all jagged rocks; it hurts your feet like mad. It's windy and very cold from the saddle on up, by prepared. The altitude also makes it very difficult to breathe. Quite a bit of wildlife which was very neat!"
375,2014-07-26,[''],"Went on the hike to see mountain goats but you have to go very far up to have a chance to see them. Very hot, steep hill. was only able to make it a little way because of lack of light and water. Recommend doing it earlier in the summer if you want to see Mountain Goats like me."
376,2014-07-10,['hiking'],"Totally beautiful & exhilarating hike until you reach the saddle. At that point unless you're a professional endurance athlete, you will struggle. Took us 4 & 1/2 hours to reach the top & we all patted ourselves on the back until our friend, who we had  no idea was hiking that day & is a endurance athlete, summited 5 minutes after us, having started TWO hours later!!!!!!! LOL. The views are incredible & those goats are pretty cool. We did see a couple families who were really struggling on the way down with younger kids & I really don't recommend it for anyone under 14. The top 4 miles of trail is mostly that craggy, large sharp rock, which adds to the difficulty. It was worth it but I won't be doing it again."
377,2014-07-06,['hiking'],"What a fantastic hike! First time hiking this with a friend and we both loved it. It took us about 8 hours, but we weren't hiking extremely fast. We slid down the glacier on the east end of the ridge, ending at Emerald Lake and seeing mountain goats everywhere. For most of the trail it is a relatively mild incline and is well maintained. Only once you reach the saddle does the trail get steeper and more difficult. The only reason I would rate this hike as difficult is because of the length."
378,2013-08-29,['hiking'],Hiked up to the first pass/ridge and ran out of time and had to turn back. Need to try again.
379,2013-08-28,['walking'],"Used the Timpanooke Trail to backpack in with my best girlfriend. We hit the trail just after 2:30pm and made camp around 7pm in the Timpanogos Basin just in time before the rain hit. It took us about four hours to reach this lovely campsite just off the mail trial by the port-a-potty. We saw an impressive moose blocking the trail (which merely rolled its eyes at such pitiful humans and continued munching) and lots of deer during our afternoon hike.  I was glad the snowfield had completely melted due to record breaking heat this summer. 
We got up very early, 4:30am, to continue the hike, keeping to the Timpanooke Trail and enjoyed the sunrise from the summit. Although this trail is reported to be less steep than Alpine it is still a strenuous hike and my friend was very patient with me as I staggered up the mountain that afternoon, not used to carrying extra weight. We brought our own water and cooked our own food over a propane burner including hot cocoa for the summit where we had plenty of company to enjoy the spectacular views of the valleys in the morning sunlight. The chipmunks aren't shy about begging for handouts up there and, yes, I indulged them with pieces of my granola bar. 
We returned to our camp, packed everything up and I'd say it took us about six hours total (from summit to parking lot) to get back down. This was a wonderful experience and I recommend it for anyone who's never seen the sunrise from the top of the second highest mountain in Utah County."
380,2013-08-20,['hiking'],"This trail was a bit to busy for me, even starting at 6am on a weekday.   I would hate to see the weekend.   

That said, this trail is stunning.  Bring plenty of water and a lunch and you'll love it too.  "
381,2013-08-07,['hiking'],The view from the summit is amazing.  We started at the trailhead at 9:00am and were back by 4:00pm.  The wildflowers are in full bloom at the beginning of August.  The trail is crowded on weekends.
382,2013-08-04,['hiking'],"5 stars for beauty and views, 5 stars for trail easiness, 1 star for your exhaustion afterwards.  Amazingly beautiful, well worth the pain you suffer during and afterwards."
383,2013-07-18,['hiking'],"Started out on a rainy day on July 12 2013.  It was absolutely the most beautiful way to experience the trail!  The rain was on and off, and we only made it to the 1st rock slide crossing, before we decided to turn around due to our hands getting cold.  I have summited 3yrs prior, and plan on doing it again in 2013.  Wild flowers and waterfalls were outstanding!"
384,2012-08-08,['hiking'],"Awesome hike, just did first time. The view is amazing. Would recommend doing."
385,2012-06-15,['hiking'],Great all-day hike! Left he trailhead at six and got back around 5pm. Made it up to the saddle and a great view of the northern part of the valley. 
386,2011-08-20,['hiking'],Made it about half way was very fun but got lost on the way to get to the first glacier other then that it was fun
