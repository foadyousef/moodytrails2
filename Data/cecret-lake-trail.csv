0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],"such a beautiful and fun hike. great for entire family. All kids, ages 3-10 did great and loved it. "
1,2019-09-03,['hiking'],"Short hike with big payoff. Wasn't super crowded, but plenty of room for people to spread out. Views for days and even saw a Bobcat up into the hills!"
2,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"While I think this was an AWESOME hike, I would classify it as more of a moderate hike (at least the last half) it’s really steep and rocky. It’s just good to know that before you go, but our whole family did it! (Ages 17 down to 5). Beautiful lake and if you look you can see salamanders in it! "
3,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Busy for Labor Day but beautiful hike with some incline, carried a baby and only got mildly sweaty if that helps the moms out there "
4,2019-09-01,['hiking'],Trail was perfect going up this morning but by 11am way to crowded for me...
5,2019-08-31,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Beautiful! Rocky path up the mountain but definitely do-able. I had a severe knee injury a few yrs back and was worried it would be too rough but took it slow, so it wasn't bad at all. Although I would say its moderate rather than easy... to me easy means mostly flat and not rocky. I will definitely do it again."
6,2019-08-30,['hiking'],"Nice and easy hike! Getting to the lake is fun, continuing the hike for higher views is better. "
7,2019-08-29,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Great trail for a quick hike.
8,2019-08-27,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'rocky']",Beautiful. We hiked it Sunday evening with our young kids and it wasn't hard at all. We saw a deer grazing and some cool birds. The trail is wide which is nice and it's not too far to the lake. It took us about 30 minutes to get there with stopping for pictures. The mosquitos didn't bother us unless we were stopped. The wildflowers weren't as pretty as I thought they'd be so it wasn't wowing. Maybe that has to do with the time of day we went. When we started it was a little chilly but we warmed up once we got hiking. We got back to our car right when it was dark. We did pay the $8 to go up to the campground and start right at the trailhead since we were so late and had littles with us. It was a great hike and I'd like to do it again sometime.

10,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",Amazing hike. We camped over night on the edge of the lake and it was phenomenal waking up to the sun and the stars at night. They are clear and mesmerizing. The elevation change got to us a bit because we aren’t used to hiking straight up. The last leg of the trail is a couple of switchbacks that are steep and close to the edge of the cliff that sits to the back of the lake. Mosquitoes are out so bring blocker! We heard moose drinking from the lake while we slept. It was a great hike! Bring lots of water!
11,2019-08-25,['hiking'],Amazing challenging hike
12,2019-08-24,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
13,2019-08-24,['hiking'],my favorite place to chill in Utah. only a 30 min hike from the parking lot after you pay a $8 fee. It's a very easy hike.

16,2019-08-20,['hiking'],"Short romp up to see the stunning views, the lake and “Devil’s Castle” ridge behind. It was crowded, but the trail is wide and it didn’t detract from the view. You can continue up past the lake for even better views. "
17,2019-08-17,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'rocky']",Beautiful landscape
18,2019-08-13,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",
19,2019-08-13,['hiking'],Awesome trail with splendid views and wildflowers
20,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",
21,2019-08-11,['hiking'],Access to the Albion Basin Campground parking area is available. The dirt road between the booth and the campground has an amazing wildflower display. I saw only a couple-three mosquitos. 
22,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Short hike, a little steep at the end. Beautiful throughout, especially the lake. But holy hell, the mosquitos. Swarms of them. Be prepared"
23,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'washed out']",
24,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",*BRING BUG SPRAY*- We headed up the trail around 8am and the mosquitos ate us alive! The wild flowers are crazy beautiful right now along the Albion Wilderness Trail. Rocky and steep towards the end but otherwise a relatively easy and nice hike up to the lake.
25,2019-08-03,['hiking'],loved the trailer.. only problem was the 1000000 mosquitos 
26,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
27,2019-08-02,['hiking'],"Nice wide trail made it easy to help my younger kids 5 and 2 on the trail. When we got to the switchbacks just before the lake I made my 2 year old get in the hiking backpack so we wouldn't be as slow. Doable, but holding a younger kids hand is helpful for some of the bigger steps up rocks and especially down. Got there about 8 am and there were 20+  parking spots. When we left at 10 (played at the lake for awhile) there were only a few parking spots where  people had just left and many people parked down the road at the pay station and about 10 cars lined up to get in. $8 per car to use the summer road and get to the trailhead. If you get there before 7am you are to use the self pay station. Wildflowers are just starting to bloom on the trail with some real pretty meadows. The lower basin has lots more flowers blooming so I'm guessing a little higher up will follow suit shortly. Definitely bring bug spray. Lots of mosquitoes, especially when we first got there."
28,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'no shade', 'rocky']","Short, solid hike with rewarding views. Loses one star due to the insane amount of bugs, awkward parking situation, and crowd. "
29,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"Shuttle service now offered on holidays and weekends for high traffic. Comes and goes every 30 ish minutes; two shuttles go back and forth. Very little snow around but it’s gorgeous! Wild flowers are in bloom and it feels like spring up there. Crowded for parking, trail wasn’t too bad if you went early, but we went on a holiday. Absolutely beautiful. Cool air and perfect for a picnic with kiddos! We took our two year old."
30,2019-07-24,['hiking'],"Wildflowers still need another week or two, but still gorgeous."
31,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Lots of mosquitoes right now in the morning. Rocky, but a fun hike! "
32,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"Pretty easy trail. Not a lot of parking in the evenings if you pay the $8 to go up the summer road so be sure to arrive early. Saw 2 moose and a beaver. Wild flowers are starting to bloom, it was beautiful. "
33,2019-07-23,['hiking'],$8 to go past the booth. Cool night hike with lots of deer and we saw a porcupine 
34,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",My first time on this trail.  Steep in places but not difficult.  You cross water several times but it’s easy to step across on rocks and keep your feet dry.  The mountain air feels cool and beautiful first thing in a morning - but lots of mosquitos out around the campground.
35,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",
36,2019-07-16,['hiking'],The Summer Road with access to the Albion Basin Campground and the Cecret Lake Trailhead is now open for the season. 
37,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Just heard that they will open Albion Basin Campground next weekend (7/20), so access to Cecret Lake should be easier/shorter at that point. Looking forward to hiking it then"
38,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"Part of the road to the trailhead is closed. As of July 13, 2019, the hike ends up being just short of 7 miles with 1,104 ft in elevation gain. Parts of the trail are flooded over with streams, so it's pretty muddy in places. No snow on the lake, but a lot surrounding it."
39,2019-07-10,"['hiking', 'snow']","Hiked up on July 6. Road was closed, so parked at the upper Alta lot, and walked up the dirt road (Albion Basin Road) to the trailhead. The trail itself has some large streams that can be difficult to cross, and there is lots of snow near the top, so you'll have to go off trail a decent amount to get to the lake. The lake still has quite a bit of snow in it."
40,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'snow']","The Albion base area will be closed for the summer of 2019 due to construction.

Due to extremely limited parking access at Cecret Lake/Catherine's Pass Trailheads and to reduce congestion on the Summer Road and in the upper Albion Basin parking areas, it is highly recommended that hikers park in the Wildcat base area parking lot and hike the Lower Albion Meadows Trail to the Upper Albion Meadows Trail or ride the $5 shuttle provided by Alta Ski Area on weekends and holidays.

Due to above average snowfall, the Summer Road is not expected to open until mid-July."
41,2019-06-06,"['hiking', 'closed', 'snow']","The gate to the road is closed until July 4, 2019. We hiked up the road, easy walking and pretty views, only to discover up top that there’s no real trail due to snow. The lake is snowed over as well, I recommend waiting until later in the summer/fall to do this hike. "

43,2019-05-12,"['hiking', 'no shade']",
44,2018-10-30,[''],"****ATTENTION****

As of October 30 Cecret Lake Trail is closed. In fact, the only road to the trail is closed for construction."
45,2018-10-11,['hiking'],"Super easy, just chill and cool view at top."
46,2018-10-01,['hiking'],"This trail is closed through October 2018.  I made the trip up yesterday, along with quite a few other hikers, only to find out it is temporarily closed."
47,2018-09-22,[''],"It was pretty. The hike was fairly easy until the last part where it’s rocky, steep switchbacks. I’m out of shape and kinda died a little. The lake was smaller than I imagined but it was so nice just chilling on the rocks catching my breath! The breeze was a definite plus!"
48,2018-09-16,['hiking'],Pretty beautiful; enjoyed it. Great hike for a date with someone who isn’t that outdoorsy.
49,2018-09-15,[''],This was a beautiful hike but you now have to pay 6 dollars to park at the base of the hike or walk 2.2 miles to get to the hike.
50,2018-09-07,[''],Great hike but I wouldn't have labeled it as easy. Towards the end of the hike it became a challenge. The last part of the trail to get to the lake is steep and involves switchbacks. To me pretty strenuous but the result of it is very rewarding.
51,2018-09-06,['hiking'],Hate they make you pay now. But this trail is family friendly with some information. It's always nice and cool especially with a breeze.
52,2018-09-04,['hiking'],"Great trail overall. Most of it can be considered easy. However, it is important to note that the final tenth of a mile or so is quite rigorous with switchbacks. The payoff is just at the top of the hill though. For this who are not accustomed to walking at higher elevation and/or engaging in regular exercise, the last 10th is quite challenging.

Also, there is NO shuttle bus. You can buy lift tickets at Albion base (ample parking). It is FREE to ride the lift DOWN, but not up."
53,2018-09-02,['hiking'],Fun hike but I wouldn’t say it’s easy. More moderate. I hike a lot and it’s a good little climb.
54,2018-08-26,['trail running'],I thought it was a relatively easy trail and very nice reward at the end.  Very popular and crowded trail. Would recommend for beginners
55,2018-08-26,['hiking'],This has been my favorite hike in the SLC area so far!!!!!
56,2018-08-19,['hiking'],Hiked this in August with a healing ankle sprain. Fairly easy with beautiful views. Highly recommended.
57,2018-08-19,[''],Great hike!
58,2018-08-17,[''],I loved this hike!! It was great for me and my boys!! It was a good length and a mix of flat and a little steep!
59,2018-08-10,['hiking'],"Grandkids loved the hike, ages 2-14. Not too bad until the last ¼ mile, it was steep, rocky, switchbacks. Parking was tough on a Friday morning. Beautiful views. While the wildflowers are almost gone, there was still a few to enjoy. Trail is very dusty. We plan on doing this again next year closer to Mid-July."
60,2018-08-07,['hiking'],Awesome little hike to a beautiful alpine lake!
61,2018-08-07,[''],"Busy, fairly steep in places. Beautifull hike."
62,2018-08-07,[''],Lake is muddy green brown and there are few flowers. Not worth the $6 to get in here.
63,2018-08-06,['hiking'],"Was surprised my 3 year old made it to the top. Pretty easy until the last 25% where it gets a bit steep, narrow and scrambled for very young kids. The lake up top reminded me a little of String Lake at the Grand Tetons. Salamanders and chipmunks were another reward."
64,2018-08-05,[''],Beautiful trail for a rookie. Great views and the lake at the end makes to journey worthwhile.
65,2018-08-04,['hiking'],Pretty.
66,2018-08-04,[''],Be aware: Alta is charging $6 per vehicle to use the road to get to the trail.
67,2018-08-03,[''],so beautiful! great work out
68,2018-08-03,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. Should not be rated as easy. Very steep incline to get to the lake, but it’s worth it."
69,2018-08-01,[''],It was a fun family hour and half.  My kids liked it.
70,2018-08-01,['hiking'],"very good trail for the first 0.8 miles, but the last 0.1 mile of the trail is very difficult and steep. overall, it was a very fun hike."
71,2018-07-31,[''],"Fantastic 3.5 mile round trip hike, super clear water with great views."
72,2018-07-30,[''],was good
73,2018-07-27,['hiking'],"I used to love this hike until it grew in popularity. The ski lifts bringing people practically right to it have ruined it for me. We picked up so much trash. If used to be our tradition to go once a year as it was my little ones first hike, but the traffic jams on the switch backs and the phones ringing while at the lake took away from the peaceful feeling I seek when going to the mountains. 
Pick up your trash everyone!"
74,2018-07-26,[''],Heavily trafficked is an understatement. The flowers are beautiful. And we saw moose right on the trail.
75,2018-07-25,['hiking'],We are just getting into hiking and this was a great one. We road the lift up to the top and hiked the rest of the way to the lake. It was a perfect day! We even saw a moose on the way down! Very awesome. Weather was perfect.
76,2018-07-25,[''],Incredible hike with great views!
77,2018-07-24,[''],"NOT EASY! Alltrails lies! Beautiful, though, and totally worth it."
78,2018-07-24,[''],"The wildflowers were beautiful. We were able to see deer, moose, and squirrels."
79,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes, especially when the wildflowers are in bloom July-Aug. hiked it for sunrise this morning to beat the crowds. It’s even batter when you have it to yourself."
80,2018-07-23,[''],"Start your hike from the bottom of the Sunnyside lift.  If you drive up the summer road to the actual trailhead you will save yourself about a mile or so of hiking, but you will also miss out on the majority of the wildflowers.  Trail is currently clear and dry with the exception of the runoff crossings, definitely crowded so plan ahead if you have small children."
81,2018-07-23,['hiking'],"beautiful and pretty easy trail. wild flowers are amazing, and we got to see 2 moose and a deer! the end close to the lake is really the only ""hard"" part and it's really not bad."
82,2018-07-22,[''],"Went in July and the wildflowers made this hike phenomenal.  We parked at the Albion lot near the lodge and walked the whole way up.  All told it was about 4 miles.  We took 5 kids, and the beginning is pretty steep at times.  About a half mile in, it gets a tad easier, but the last .5 miles is pretty steep right before you get to the lake."
83,2018-07-20,['hiking'],"We paid the $6 fee and parked at the Albion Basin Campground parking lot to shave some of the miles off since we were hiking with toddlers. This was an easy enough hike for my 3 year old (with a few breaks, of course). The flowers were BEAUTIFUL and in full bloom and we enjoyed the scenery. The switch backs right before you reach the lake were definitely the most difficult part of the hike, but overall it’s easy. There were lots of bugs at the lake, so be sure to bring bug spray."
84,2018-07-18,[''],"We hiked it today and the wildflowers are stunning and full bloom! Heads up though, there is road construction and significant delays"
85,2018-07-17,['hiking'],This is one of our favorites. Mosquitos are bad at the lake right now but manageable. Wildflowers are beautiful. An easy hike for me and my 5 year old to walk himself. Don't forget $6 if you want to park at Catherine's or cecret parking lots!
86,2018-07-16,['hiking'],Wildflowers are amazing right now!
87,2018-07-16,['hiking'],"I've been hiking in Utah for as long as I can remember, and I don't think I've ever seen wildflowers like this. GO NOW WHILE THEY'RE STILL AT THEIR PEAK! We went in the evening (around 6:30), so it wasn't as crowded as during the day on a weekend, but still plenty of people."
88,2018-07-14,['hiking'],This hike is full of wonder and beauty! The flowers through the Albion Basin are amazing. This hike is a steeper hike. You’re already up 10 thousand plus feet in altitude so the hike can be a bit of a challenge for a newbie but it is worth it if you are able to take it slower. One of my favorites! ❤️
89,2018-07-10,['hiking'],We parked at Alta and hiked up. The kids complained the whole way (It’s a little bit of an incline) but it was beautiful. So worth it!
90,2018-07-09,['hiking'],"Our third time on this trail. We enjoy it every time. Seems to be more wildflowers this time (July 8, 2018) than at the end of July 2017. Keep in mind this trail is a bit steep, so when you get to the top bring something to enjoy your time there like snacks (don't litter, please :) ), a blanket or hammock for lazing for a bit.

This year, they started charging $6 to park at the closest lot to the trail (we parked further away, so did not pay for parking). Some people are complaining about that charge. After seeing three different rangers (one from the US forest service, one from Alta Ski Resort- who came up twice in the time we were there- and the third from Alta city) coming up and down the trail helping people who were struggling and ready to give out water (or probably even first aid if needed), I have no problem to pay that $6 in the future if we park in that lot. And, I am sure at times, they are also picking up garbage people leave/drop. Thank you, rangers!"
91,2018-07-08,[''],"After I hiked the Albion Basin, I headed up to Cecret Lake.  Just a short 0.9 miles from the campground.  It was a nice short beautiful hike, and the walk around the lake was a great cherry on top for it was adventuresome yet not too dangerous with an extra dose of more wildflowers in the mix.  Loved it.  Perfect start to the day. Remember this hike is best to do off peak hours, and before 7:30 you don't have to pay $7 to park.  Weekends buses run up to the parking lot to help you enjoy this area.   HAPPY HIKING!  https://shaunasadventures.blogspot.com/2018/07/360-adventure-hike-to-cecret-lake.html?m=1"
92,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"Easy, short hike. Plan to pay the new $6 summer road fee at Alta. You are offered 3 options: pay $6 to drive up to the campground parking lot, park at Alta and do the 5+ mile round-trip hike through Albion Basin, or pay $10 per person to take the ski lift up."
93,2018-07-07,['walking'],"Nice trail, beautiful scenery! We even saw a moose!"
94,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"Took the kids. 5 and 7. It wasn’t easy, but kids managed. Lots of elevation gain, but the views at the end were beautiful and serene. Wildflowers were blooming too."
95,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"This was such a fun hike! The wildflowers were beautiful! And lots of kids had little nets to catch salamanders in the lake! So i highly recommend bringing some so you can catch them. Also make sure to use the all trails app to make sure you’re on the right trail because we got a little lost, but overall it was a great experience. :)"
96,2018-07-05,['hiking'],Fun family hike to small lake full of salamanders. Easy in and out. Can get crowded.
97,2018-07-04,[''],"This was a gorgeous hike! We didn’t get to stay as long as we wanted to, but it was really pretty. My only critique is that you have to pay $6 to get up there. Which isn’t that bad, but when you expect it to be free.... but the lake is amazing! I would definitely go again :)"
98,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"Today was July 4th so it was extremely busy but still managed to have a great time. Update: New this year Alta Ski resort now operates the trailhead. There is a small fee to park. Since it was so busy today it was 1 car in, 1 car out. We elected to ride chair lift up for $10 a person and park in the resort lot."
99,2018-07-04,['backpacking'],Always crowded during the summer. To avoid the crowds go early or late
100,2018-07-03,[''],This is one of the greatest short hikes in the Wasatch. Easily completed it with a 3 and 5 year old with plenty of sunlight to spare after we didn’t leave our home in slc until 6pm. Mosquitos were out in force but a misting of 20% deet kept them completely at bay. Tiger salamanders were also out in droves in the lake. Flowers not even close to full peak yet. Snow completely gone from anywhere close to the trail. Weekdays are the time to hit this trail to guarantee parking and limit the crowds on the trail and edge of the lake.
101,2018-07-03,[''],"Really fun and an excellent spot for a picnic, but expect some bugs at the lake. I recommend starting from the lower Albion basin and hiking up to the cecret lake trailhead."
102,2018-07-02,[''],"I did this hike this morning with my six month old son and couple coworkers. It was a very beautiful hike. The only down fall was we saw a cougar on our final climb up to the lake. It kept its distance but made us very on edge. So anyone going out there with little ones be sure to keep them close, and always communicate with others you see on the trail as well."
103,2018-07-01,['hiking'],"A great hike, nice and cool when we went in June, still snow on the ground in some places.  Lake is nice and pristine."
104,2018-06-30,['hiking'],Fun trail with bunch of kids...
105,2018-06-22,[''],This is a family favorite hike.  We usually go the first week of July (after the gates open) and take nets from the dollar store to catch and release salamanders.  We see a moose frequently on this trail.
106,2018-06-22,['hiking'],The road is closed until 6/30/2018!
107,2018-06-16,[''],"One of my favorite summer hikes. Wildflowers are spectacular. This is a fairly easy hike, the end gets a bit rocky and steep. The lake at the top is lovely and it’s nice to sit in the quiet."
108,2018-06-16,['hiking'],"So... Albion Basin road was closed and I'd promised three 4 year-olds we were going to make it to the lake. We decided to take a shortcut instead of walk the entire road. Neither I nor my friend knew exactly where the trailhead was, but we figured we would find it when we got to the top of the road. The trailhead is in the campground.  That somehow isn't made very clear here. There's still quite a bit of snow and a whole lot of mud.
What is listed here as 1.7 miles ended up being 7.3 for us. My little hikers-in-training were troopers, but I am sore."
109,2018-06-11,[''],Beautiful and easy hike. Busy though and lots of kids.
110,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"Hiked this on 6/3, still knee deep snow covering most of the trail so plan on your feet getting wet. We hiked the summer road up to the campground since it is not open until the end of June, and there was no snow on that. We did end up making it to the lake and it was still mostly frozen. Then we slid on our butts down the snow where the switchbacks are, it was easier than trying to climb back down it. This is easily one of the most crowded trails in Utah in the summer, but this time we saw one other person the whole time so this was a plus."
111,2018-05-28,['hiking'],"I took my wife and kids up to this trail on a whim.  I’d heard about it from a friend who raved last year about the beautiful flowers.  I would have been well served to look up the details on the terrain this time of year.  I didn’t realize how high the trailhead is.  I expected to see snow, but I didn’t expect to see nothing but snow.  It turned into a great little adventure.  The dirt road to the trailhead was still gated, so it added just over two miles to our journey.  I used my phone to point us to the direction of the lake and we meandered up.  The snow was mostly crusted over so that walking on top of it was not a problem, but I post-holed up to my knees or deeper a few times.
The nice thing about going so early in the year was that when we got to the lake mid-day, we were the only ones there.  A few other people showed up while we ate our snacks and took in the scenery.
My kids said it was one of their most favorite hikes ever."
112,2018-05-27,['snowshoeing'],"The forecast of rain drowned my hiking plans, but rising above the fog and drizzle, I soared up to 8,800' while the temperature dipped to 37 degrees at Alta. Snowshoeing solo on soft snow over two miles of abandoned ski runs and frozen road to the campground in a fine snowfall and steady breeze, and another mile beyond and above Cecret Lake to about 10,200', I quit after two hours of climbing a half mile from Germania Pass to conserve energy for today's activities. Backcountry skiers were spotted making their ascents, and Devil's Castle cliffs emerged frequently from the solitary mist. Cecret was still frozen, and the silent lift lines and snow making equipment detracted little from the majesty. My spirit was contrite as I rode the gusty breeze that chased me back down. Descending swiftly down a winding chute that forms the headwaters of Cottonwood Creek, I dropped into Albion Basin and reached my car in less than an hour, having covered 5 miles in 3 hours with 1,400' gain. Enough fun. There was 12 hours of work to do at home and the office, but nothing could detract from this excellent morning!"
113,2018-02-23,['hiking'],"Catching up on some reviews, so recognize that I did this hike in early September. Went with some friends to hike this on Labor day. Quite possibly the worst day to do so. The parking lot closest to the lake was filled, so we had to park at the ski lodge. We could have taken a shuttle from there to the real trailhead, but the wait was 45min+, so we started our hike from there. Very sunny, hot, and exposed for most of it, so be prepared. Also, there were so many people! This would have been much nicer if the trail wasn't so backed up. Didn't stay long at the lake because of how many others were already there. Other than the heavy traffic, this would have been a nice, short, enjoyable hike."

115,2017-11-25,[''],"Pretty lake, but it’s a super short hike"
116,2017-11-08,[''],Cecret Lake is a beautiful place. One of my favorite hikes. In August this beautiful hike is home to thousands of wild flowers!
117,2017-10-26,[''],Beautiful lake and lovely hike.  Summer wildflowers are stunning!
118,2017-10-25,[''],Really lovely. Very few people There when we went (2 days ago).
119,2017-10-11,['hiking'],Great hike. Kids loved it! Rocky and a little steep towards the end with a lot of cut backs but otherwise fairly easy hike. I did it with my 25 pound 2 year old on my back and I'm not in great shape. My 4 year old made it up by himself as well with little to no help. We went Oct. 9th 2017 later in the afternoon around 3:30. We got up right before the sun went over the mountain and it got cold real fast.
120,2017-10-09,['hiking'],Beautiful. Worth the short hike!
121,2017-10-09,[''],Short hike a little difficult at the end because it is steep and you are climbing rocks. Also it was snowing and freezing cold today 08-October-2017
122,2017-10-08,[''],"Very short, but gorgeous lake!"
123,2017-10-07,['hiking'],Easy walk with beautiful views. Can see glacier smoothing of rocks.Was muddy in many spots because of recent snow.
124,2017-09-18,[''],Saw beautiful moose
125,2017-09-18,['hiking'],Easy kid friendly hike. Beautiful wild flowers at the end of summer. Lots of people so if possible go during the day on weekdays
126,2017-09-16,['hiking'],"I am not sure why this is marked as 'easy.' For those who grow up hiking, maybe it's easy for them. For newcomers to hiking, the beginning of the trail is relatively flat, but as the lake is at the top of the mountain, you will gain altitude and have to climb/walk through some rocky trails on the side of the cliff. If you aren't used to the altitude this can also pose an alternative challenge."
127,2017-09-09,[''],Oh not 6
128,2017-09-08,[''],Easy
129,2017-09-05,['hiking'],"I think this was given an ""Easy"" rating because it is short (if you start at the Cecret Lake trailhead). It has quick elevation change, especially near the end but it's like using stairs. Nice views and a pretty lake. Be ready to stop and wait in certain spots if you go in summer due to this lake's popularity. We went when there was construction, so we started at Albion Base, which added almost 3 miles round trip. Much of the trail from Albion Base was steep, which might warrant a ""Moderate"" rating. In fact, this hike from Albion Base  was pretty similar to Horsetail Falls in length and elevation change (just a bit easier), and Horsetail Falls was given a ""Hard"" rating."
130,2017-09-04,['hiking'],We did not wait for the shuttle to take us to the trail head so it was a longer hike - 5 miles in all. I would rate this more if a moderate hike for sure given the elevation gain. Nice hike to do once but I have definitely seen better? Not bad. Glad we did it once.
131,2017-09-03,['hiking'],Pretty hike! Easy too
132,2017-08-28,['hiking'],"The last bit is rocky, but the lake is lovely. Park at the entrance and hike up Albion meadows trail, lots of pretty wildflowers!"
133,2017-08-28,[''],"this hike is the perfect length for a quick day hike. we got incredibly lucky and saw a big bull moose at the lake, really an amazing sight!"
134,2017-08-27,['hiking'],"AMAZING hike!  Lots and lots of variety.  We crossed streams, we saw lots of wildlife (2 moose, lots of squirrels and chipmunks) 

We carried our 1 year old in a child carrier and our other 4 kids walked. Even our youngest, 4 years old was challenged but managed the entire way with a positive attitude. The lake the amazing, but the hike up was the real reward. As you go, don't be so eager to achieve the destination, enjoy the journey!  

We went in late August, at 7pm.  Got back to the car at dark, enjoyed the stars on the walk down (glad we brought flashlights!) 

One more note: parking is a nightmare. Just be patient and wait your turn."
135,2017-08-23,['hiking'],Two amazing moose at the top of the trail near Cecret Lake- largest bull I've ever seen and very exciting.   The wildflowers are still very colorful and blooming so pretty.
136,2017-08-22,['hiking'],it was a little crowded but the family enjoyed the hike.
137,2017-08-19,[''],We love this hike. Our 4 year old son enjoys it as well and only gets tired at the end. The rocky area is tiring for some - the lake and views are worth it! You can also tent camp at the base of it (get there early for general parking or for camping to get a spot).
138,2017-08-18,[''],Easy short hike. There's a bit of a steep incline right before reaching the lake but we were fine with a baby and toddler. Beautiful sights - there's a campground at the trailhead that is worth looking into if you want a place to camp out in Alta. Lake was nice and we saw salamander. The mountains around this area are pretty majestic.
139,2017-08-16,[''],Love this hike in August when the wildflowers are in bloom.
140,2017-08-14,['hiking'],"Very pretty. We went a weird way down but the hike up was easy to the lake was good. Good for family
and wanting a short hike"
141,2017-08-12,[''],
142,2017-08-12,['hiking'],Beautiful and peaceful night hike. Wonderful views.
143,2017-08-12,['hiking'],"Great hike to do with the kids.  We went early in the morning and got a great parking spot at the trailhead.  The first part of the trail is in the shade, then the second half is in the sun on rocky footing.  The kids loved scampering around the lake.  The only drawback to this hike is the number of people on the trail and at the lake.  It wasn't too bad when we got there, but, boy, it was crowded by the time we left!"
144,2017-08-09,['hiking'],We started the hike at 6:30am on a Wednesday. There were plenty of spaces even when we finished around 9am. The parking lot isn't as small as everyone described; it fits at least 20 vehicles. The trail is a nicely paved path that runs through a gorgeous meadow. It isn't till about .6 miles in that it starts to get rocky and the incline begins. There's three quick switchbacks and you've reached the lake! I rate this trail moderate because of elevation and the rocky part. I just moved to Utah and I've yet to get used to the altitude.
145,2017-08-08,['hiking'],"I would rate this trail as moderately strenuous rather than easy. We managed to take a wrong turn but were thankful to avoid the main trail. After the fork to the private cabin, stay right rather than follow the small sign with the hiker on it. Go figure. Many crying children ruining the solitude. Please know your child's ability before attempting this trail. Parking is extremely limited. The lot was full by 10am on a Tuesday. The lake is beautiful and the waterdogs/salamanders are fun to see. The salamanders were the highlight for us!"
146,2017-08-08,['hiking'],"Beautiful views and the wildflowers were worth the wait to see.  I wouldn't say the trail is easy, the trail is quite steep toward the end.  Take some bug spray with you.  Three out of the four of us couldn't make it up the last steep bit to actually see the lake due to physical limitations or age.  Definitely wouldn't say this trail is for all skill levels.  For us Cecret lake is still a secret."
147,2017-08-08,[''],Beautiful hike. Fun trail.
148,2017-08-04,['hiking'],I would not label this as easy. There is a significant incline and many children on the trail seemed miserable. We did see a moose right near the trail which was the highlight.
149,2017-08-03,[''],We had a great time yesterday. A little long for little ones if you walk from the lower lot so get there early or make sure to park in upper lot. Beautiful wild flowers and amazing views.
150,2017-08-02,[''],"Amazing hike, easy enough for all hikers. I would reccomend take the shuttle up, hike to the lake then hike down through the wild flowers back to the car.  Best time to go is mid to late July."
151,2017-08-01,['hiking'],Great hike. I hadn't done this for a long time. It was great the get out of the heat of the valley.
152,2017-08-01,[''],"Great hike, nice and easy. Wildflowers were amazing. Parking was difficult (photographers are out in full force), but if you can find a spot, it's a great trail."
153,2017-07-31,['hiking'],"Did this hike last Friday, we had to park down by Albion Basin due to the parking lot being full, so it added quite a bit of distance to our hike, if you want to be able to park closer for this hike go early and on a weekday, weekends get very crowded (Friday included). 
The last part of the trail up to the lake is pretty steep and rocky, but my 4 year old handled it just fine. It is a beautiful hike and I suggest adding Albion Basin right now because the flowers are amazing! (Just keep in mind if you do Albion Basin and Cecret lake it is about 3 miles one way, but totally worth it in my opinion.)"
154,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"This trail is listed as easy but I did not find it so. So glad I didn't take my 4 yr old because she never would have made it. My 9 yr old LOVED it. He loves climbing on rocks and there were plenty of rocks, big and small, all over the place. We went on a Saturday morning and it was VERY crowded. This would probably be a better hike to do during the week."
155,2017-07-28,['hiking'],"Start from Alta if you want to see some incredible wildflowers on the way up. Just please don't pick them! Hike is always busy, but I went during the week and it wasn't too bad."
156,2017-07-28,['hiking'],"We really loved this hike especially since we had our kids with us, actually we had ages 4-66 years with us. 
The trail was super easy, with just a bit of a challenge towards the top with the switchbacks right before you get to the lake.  Once up at the lake we saw salamanders in the water.  Some people said the water level was really low compared to usual.  There were only a few puddles of water on the trail from the recent rain.  The wildflowers were really beautiful too!
The mosquitoes were pretty bad so I would suggest taking bug spray.
Overall we loved this hike and would definitely do it again."
157,2017-07-28,[''],Pretty good family hike. Water levels were low but really nice. Mosquitos were out in the evening but soooo beautiful
158,2017-07-27,['hiking'],My family and I love this hike. My daughter requests that we do it a couple of times each summer. It is a good family hike that gets a little steep toward the end. The views and wildflowers are beautiful!
159,2017-07-25,[''],Great hike. We started at the Alta parking lot which added 2 miles to the hike through the meadows. The flowers are blooming and gorgeous.
160,2017-07-24,['hiking'],
161,2017-07-24,[''],Very crowded so my wife and I decided to take a trail off the main path and witness three moose in the meadows.
162,2017-07-24,[''],"Great family trail. Beautiful in late July/early August with wild flowers, and the lake is pretty."
163,2017-07-24,[''],Beautiful hike! Amazing views! Saw a moose as well!
164,2017-07-22,[''],"Nice trail,  the earlier in the day the better to avoid crowds.  Bug spray would have been helpful.  Abundant flowers, also saw 3 moose (bull, cow, and calf), marmots and squirrels.   Would be a great trail for children to experience."
165,2017-07-21,['hiking'],Nice and mostly bug free. Steep on the end. Lots of salamanders in the lake.
166,2017-07-21,['hiking'],"Fun, relaxed, and a very pretty lake at the end. Fun with the family... Pretty short."
167,2017-07-21,[''],Good conditions along the trail. Some snow at the far side of the lake.
168,2017-07-20,['hiking'],"Went with the kids, just like everyone else. A great hike, but people are leaving trash everywhere and have no respect for the trail - choosing instead to wander everywhere in the delicate alpine. Still a great family hike. Just don't expect serenity."
169,2017-07-20,['hiking'],"The hike was easy enough for the most part. It got trickier on the switchbacks up to the lake, but still manageable. There was still some snow and little creeks to pass through. I just walked through it but take some waterproof shoes or sandals if that's a concern for you. Loved it, the lake was beautiful, lots of wildlife to be seen. :)"
170,2017-07-18,['hiking'],Loved this hike.  The lake at the end is beautiful.
171,2017-07-18,[''],Great hike!
172,2017-07-18,[''],Easy and sometimes busy but always great. Go at 7 pm in the summer to catch the sunset.
173,2017-07-17,[''],We are beginner hikers. We thought the hike was a bit difficult. But we made it and it was so worth it! The view is breath taking!
174,2017-07-15,[''],"This hike has everything. Lake, waterfall, great views, wildflowers. You have to arrive early though. We got there at 7:30 am on a Saturday and the lot was almost full."
175,2017-07-15,[''],"I wouldn't put this as a easy hike. My newly 3 year old who loves hikes and has plenty of energy to spare got tired at times so I had to carry him a long with my 11 month old. my 5 year old did great, was tired towards the end. It's a beautiful hike! there's many small streams to pass through, a bit of snow is still there, flowers are blooming."
176,2017-07-14,['hiking'],"This is a really great hike, it's really easy and would be a good one to take kids on. Take some bug spray, there are a lot of bugs around the lake."
177,2017-07-14,['hiking'],
178,2017-07-13,[''],Enjoyed
179,2017-07-10,['hiking'],"Hiked on a Saturday evening around 5pm. Found parking in the main parking lot but there were a lot of cars, very busy. Saw the shuttle going back and forth.  Trail is very well traveled. Lots of streams crossing the path / road you are walking and still snow along the way especially as you progress. Final quarter mile is a bit more technical but a 3 year old was able to navigate it with a little help. Great hike, awesome views, really pretty contrast with cliffs and green and snow."
180,2017-07-08,[''],"Always beautiful! Wildflowers are out but not in full force yet. Get there early, 6:30-7 a.m. by 8:30 it turns into Cecret Lake Mall!"
181,2017-07-07,[''],Pretty crowded but a great hike
182,2017-07-07,['hiking'],Lake worth the walk. Watch the lake for the many salamanders.
183,2017-07-06,['hiking'],Great hike to take with family members of all ages. I have gone here with my mother and my young niece's and nephew.
184,2017-07-05,[''],"When they say holidays and weekends are busy times to hike, it's a true story! At 11am they said there were 600 vehicles. We hiked up to Cecret Lake from the Alta ski lodge area. It was a beautiful hike. We will definitely be back on a weekday...when it's a bit calmer"
185,2017-07-04,[''],Had a nice little snowball fight on the 4th of July! Pretty awesome!
186,2017-07-03,[''],Easy and beautiful. 10/10.
187,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful, nice hike for beginners like me!"
188,2017-06-30,[''],A little snow on the trail here and there. Not a problem to make it up it. Even with tennis shoes and maybe younger children. Quite a bit of runoff in the trail. You can either cross on stones or walk through in a few places.
189,2017-06-29,['hiking'],My favorite hike! It's gorgeous this time of year. Kid friendly.
190,2017-06-28,['hiking'],
191,2017-06-21,['hiking'],"There was a lot of snow, mainly at the hairpin turns at the end, where it was pretty steep. Definitely recommend some crampons or snow shoes for that last part. The lake still had snow/ice on it, with some openings. I hiked from the beginning of the Albion Meadows trailhead and got there in about 1.5 hours. Getting back down was tough with that snow. But the lake was beautiful and I was one of two people out there. Just be prepared to traverse some steep snow at the end/when you leave."
192,2017-06-19,['hiking'],Reached the lake with just enough time to enjoy the water and look for creatures before the sun went behind the mountain. Lake was all melted and snow surrounded it. Gorgeous! Glad I caught a rare quiet moment there.
193,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Started at the closed gate at the end of Little Cottonwood road, went directly up the canyon and then on the ridgeline to the East.  Lake is partially melted.  Absolutely beautiful turquoise color.  Sledded back down.  Took about 3 hrs and 20 minutes RT (see my recording) 1200 ft elevation gain, about 3.5miles RT.  Recommend ski poles and microspikes. Snow is melting fast, will be gone soon."
194,2017-06-17,[''],"June 10 - road is closed getting to the parking lot. trail is still buried under 6+feet of snow. almost impossible to navigate, but we still gave it a go. We had to hike 45 minutes up the road just to get to the trailhead, then tried to hazard our way through the snow and stay on the trail. It gets STEEP... maybe not a big deal usually but with snow on the ground.. we were so worn out from wandering through snow we just couldn't go on. took us nearly 4.5 hours. would like to go back once the trails open and make it to the lake"
195,2017-06-11,['hiking'],"Hiked to the lake this morning from the Alta ski area; up through the Albion basin meadow, 5 miles RT.  Needed spikes/cleats from the Cecret lake parking lot up to the lake.  LOTS of snow.  The lake is still frozen and covered with snow.  A beautiful snow-melt waterfall above the lake."
196,2017-06-02,['hiking'],"Planned a fun hike, didn't expect so much snow. We made the most of it and made a snowman. Wait for the snow to melt.

197,2017-05-31,[''],road was closed up to parking area for snow and construction on lifts. so it was a no go. the construction guy said there were 20 ft of snow in the parking area lol so unless you have snow shoes it's no good
198,2017-05-14,['hiking'],may 12 .no trail covered by snow.
199,2017-04-23,['hiking'],"Lots of hype for a semi-decent hike.  Maybe it just wasn't the right day, but it felt drab.  The hike was relatively short, and climbs sharply at the end.  Regardless, it was a beautiful view of the Albion Basin."
200,2017-02-01,['hiking'],"if you like rocks this is a net trail for you. 
    With its information signs and beautiful landscape this hike is a fun one for going solo or with others and makes for a great view of the setting sun. there were many people taking family pictures using cell phones as well as hired photographers."
201,2016-11-15,[''],Beautiful hike. Road to trailhead was closed so it was an extra 2 miles to get to the actual trailhead. I started at 9:30 and there were few people on the trail.
202,2016-11-14,['hiking'],Insanely short and insanely easy. It's a small lake but it is beautiful. The drive alone to the top is pretty enough! No dogs.
203,2016-10-24,['hiking'],
204,2016-10-24,[''],"Beautiful scenery, LOTS of hikers on Sunday. Try to go during the week. Trail was pretty muddy from melting snow 10/23/16."
205,2016-10-16,['hiking'],"Beautiful alpine lake, worth the time and effort. Although this is a short hike, it can be a challenge for the very young or older hikers. The last stretch is steep, so young and old should take it slowly. You will be glad you did it."
206,2016-10-09,['hiking'],Hiked to Cecret lake last weekend. It was beautiful! The hike was a little steep towards the end of the trail right before you get to the lake but our older kids managed it just fine. We packed our toddlers on our backs and my husband and I made it too! Gorgeous views along the way. This was my sons favorite hike so far. Would do it again.
207,2016-10-02,['hiking'],"So,  I went early to avoid crowds. Great time too go !! Hardly anyone there. The trees are absolutely stunning this time of year and the hike was quick and easy. I did end up loosing the trail at first which made it a bit challenging to get up the cliff , however I found it easily on the way down. Was a bit unprepared so I didn't explore as much as I would've liked. Definitely want to go back before it snows."
208,2016-10-02,['hiking'],"Tried to hike this twice now, both at the end of May. Had to park in Alta and hike to the trail head because the road to the campground is still closed that time of year. I've never actually seen the lake because the snow has been too high and the trail isn't marked well. Who knows, maybe I've stood on it both years and had no idea.  Or maybe it's called ""Cecret"" lake because it doesn't really exist. It's a trick."
209,2016-10-02,[''],I did a track with snow and not have much difficulty. The place is beautiful.
210,2016-10-01,['hiking'],very busy but still a great little hike.
211,2016-09-30,['hiking'],"It's a fun little hike, I've done it a few times, one was in the snow. If you hike in the snow, you'll probably start early where the road is blocked off, and it is 7.5 miles out and back, otherwise it is quite short. It is fun."
212,2016-09-19,[''],Short and easy.  It's pretty busy though
213,2016-09-18,['hiking'],Beautiful beautiful beautiful
214,2016-09-18,['hiking'],very fun good for kids
215,2016-09-15,[''],Completed this hike with two toddlers. Most of the elevation gain is at the last part of the hike. Absolutely stunning 
216,2016-09-15,['hiking'],This hike was nicely cut out. Although in some areas the rocks were slick due to dust. We have a group and a toddler and the little boy struggled getting up some of this hills but it wasn't too bad. The lake itself was pretty. It was a pretty good view.
217,2016-09-08,['hiking'],"Trailhead is easy to find and is well marked along the way. We parked in the parking lot next to the Albion Basin Campground. Just be prepared for 2 mi of dirt road to the parking lot. It's a pretty good road, but the first half mile is really bumpy. 

The trail is a pretty easy one. Even when you get to the ""steep"" part it's actually not that steep. My 2 yr old did the whole hike without being carried. The lake is beautiful with plenty of good rocks for kids to climb on."
218,2016-09-07,['backpacking'],Brought my family from VA to enjoy Utah and boy did we...
219,2016-09-06,[''],"Went on with family and reached the lake easily, that was a good experience."
220,2016-09-06,[''],"This is a nice short hike that you can do with your whole family.  I had my 4 kids, ages 3, 6, 9, and 12 and they all did fine and we are not avid hikers.  There are a couple picnic tables near the trailhead that you could stop and eat at if you planned to picnic.  Overall a great hike for the whole family."
221,2016-09-05,['hiking'],Great hike. We went slow and it took us about 90 minutes round trip. No swimming in the lake. Bring water. Parking at the trailhead was full so we had to park at Alta and ride a shuttle up. Had to wait about 30 minutes for the shuttle to go up and down.
222,2016-09-05,[''],
223,2016-09-04,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike in the Wasatch National Forest.  Easy to moderate hike up to the lake.  Got to see some wildflowers that were still hanging on - I'm sure in July it is beautiful.  We went on a Monday, and we were lucky it was not crowded at all.  Lake is so serene!  FYI- no dogs allowed!"
224,2016-09-04,[''],Absolutely gorgeous!
225,2016-08-31,[''],"A must do hike late summer early fall! Beautiful trail. Not much shade on the final switchbacks before the lake. My 4 year old was able to complete this hike without being carried. But it was difficult for her and challenging for me with a baby on my back. I would say this is a moderate trail, quite rocky and slick where there's flat rocks covered in a layer of dirt dust.
Look for the salamanders in the lake, on the West side there's a rock overlook of the lake, the salamanders like to hide under the rocks at the bottom."
226,2016-08-30,['hiking'],"Visited early afternoon on a Monday and the campground lot was almost full.  I would say it takes no more than 30 cars and 2 where left although people where headed down to the lot from their morning hike.  FYI the dirt road leading to the campgrounds can get very bumpy so be careful and stick to the 15 mph limit.  The trail head leaves from the lot and pretty much a very slow climb to the lake with the last part fairly steep with 3 switchbacks. Be careful if not crowded it's possible to take the wrong trail inside the switchbacks.  We did (someone moved trail market rocks) and we went off trail: not good.  The trip brings you to the lake or at this time year big pond..

I believe this trail is a moderate hike as the switchbacks are narrow and steep for trail shown on this app as ""easy"".  I would not bring little ones unless they are tied to you in some fashion.  Saw a few Mom's carrying their under 5's back down.  Hiking poles suggested for us older hikers especially through switchbacks.

The hike with the above in mind is worth the trip.  Small wildlife abound around the lake area."
227,2016-08-29,['hiking'],"This hike is a little more steep and rocky than I was led to believe by reviews. It might be an easy hike for an avid hiker, but my friend and I are just starting out and were looking for a somewhat easy hike. We made it to the lake, but it was slow going and a little hard for us. It's important to remember that the oxygen is super thin up there too. It was worth it as it is so beautiful up there. Lots of traffic though."
228,2016-08-28,['hiking'],"A good way to spend a few hours out of the valley.  Not to hard, even our 4 year old was able to complete the hike up, around the lake and back down without being carried.  A lot of people on the trail on the Saturday we went."
229,2016-08-27,['hiking'],"Decent hike. I like the more wooded hikes. The lake was nice and very clear. It seemed like all the gain in elevation was at the last .2 miles or so. There were some super cute ground squirrels that tried to help them selves to my almonds. It was an alright hike but for me personally I don't know that I would drive that far up the canyon to go the short hike. I went with my sister and niece, but I am more of a fan of 5-7 mile hikes with a nice elevation gain, so my opinion might be less favorable than others would be."
230,2016-08-26,['hiking'],"We loved the hike and the lake. The water was super clear, so you could see all the little creatures very well. The trail was very nice and not slippery at all. I found it very hard to breathe. We decided to keep going up past the lake, there wasn't a trail, but it is still pretty easy because there are no trees. Amazing views all around. We expected it to be pretty packed, but it was very quiet at the lake when we went. We left camp around 6pm on a Saturday and we stayed up there until 9:30pm because it was so nice. The hike itself took about a half hour at most (one way)."
231,2016-08-24,['hiking'],"Easy hike, but a lot of fun for kids"
232,2016-08-22,[''],I love to hike so this was perfect! I would classify the first half and the way back as easy. The last half is killer with switch backs and really steep! It's definitely a climb... I took several breaks. Worth it to see the lake. I went on Sunday and it was incredibly crowded still.
233,2016-08-20,['hiking'],"Very beautiful!  Also VERY crowded.  Expect beauty, but not solitude or quiet."
234,2016-08-18,['hiking'],"One of my Absolute Favorites! The crowds can be tedious but go during the week or early Sunday, 9/10 we see Moose and Deer - perfect quick hike with Wildflowers and Amazing Scenery"
235,2016-08-17,['hiking'],Went on a Tuesday night. Not too crowded. Saw a mom and baby moose. beautiful area.
236,2016-08-17,[''],Quick stroll with a magnificent view.
237,2016-08-15,['hiking'],"Very heavily trafficked trail but worth the views and scenery, especially during late summer when the Albion Basin is full of wildflowers."
238,2016-08-14,[''],Fun for the whole family!
239,2016-08-13,['hiking'],This is a nice little hike all the way at the top of little cottonwood. I'd do it again for the views and the relative easy access to an Alpine lake. You can take a free shuttle up from Alta or drive the last few miles to the trailhead on a packed dirt road. It's a short hike in Albion Basin to a nice little lake. We took our 2 year old and 1 month old. Day only word of caution: don't come here if you're looking for solitude - the trail was lined with hiking groups and every nice spot around the edge of the lake had been claimed.
240,2016-08-12,[''],"amazing hike! My three-year-old hiked all the way up to the top, even though we had to carry her down. It gets pretty steep towards the end but overall a beautiful hike."
241,2016-08-12,['hiking'],"short one mile, not too steep, with beautiful views. Last 1/4 mile trail narrows and gets a little steeper with rocky areas. lots of little critters running around and not afraid to approach you."
242,2016-08-09,[''],"This was BEAUTIFUL. It was difficult for my 69 year old Dad's knees, not level, but he made it. Next year we'll come in July when the flowers are not dying."
243,2016-08-08,[''],"Moose right next to the trailhead. Tons of beautiful wildflowers. Trail was fairly easy, although the last portion right before the lake could be challenging as it is fairly steep and rocky. Lake was pristine and beautiful. Good views."
244,2016-08-07,['hiking'],"This trail was really challenging for me. I would definitely rate it as ""Moderate"" Especially if you have very little hiking experience and are 30 pounds overweight. Once you get up to the lake, it's really quite pretty, and the air is cool. 

Just look out for the afternoon thunderstorms. I got rained on and pelted with hail today."
245,2016-08-06,['hiking'],Perfect hike for kids
246,2016-08-03,[''],Sorry if you don't think this is a 5 star you don't like beauty. Sure there's quite a few people so it's heavily trafficked but that doesn't detract from the fact this is as beautiful as mountain scenery gets IMO!
247,2016-08-01,['hiking'],The trail has beautiful wild flowers and great views of the mountains surrounding it.  The last part is narrow dusty switchbacks to the lake.  This portion is very crowded.  The lake is pretty with a few different places along the shoreline to sit and relax and enjoy.
248,2016-08-01,[''],All time favorite family hike. Beautiful water features and wild flowers.
249,2016-07-31,['hiking'],"We visited Cecret Lake a few weekends ago. Absolutely beautiful hike. I was blown away by the wild flowers. The path gets a little steep and rocky right before the lake, but still an easy climb for our 2 eight year olds and 11 year old."
250,2016-07-30,[''],"Such a great hike, one of our favorites. The kids love catching salamanders. (We release them after off course). It's always one of their Summer highlights. Easy hike, took about 30 min up."
251,2016-07-28,[''],Great
252,2016-07-24,['hiking'],Good hike.  Crowded though.  We were there early and still had to park at the Catherine Pass lot.  Last 1/4 mile is tough but worth it.  I continued on towards Sugarloaf Peak.  Made it about 3/4 of the way before i turned back.  Next time though.
253,2016-07-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful kid friendly hike! Took 4, 6 and 8 year old kids and my 70 year old parents. The last third was pretty challenging but they all made it and the lake at the top was definitely worth the effort! WILDFLOWERS were amazing in mid-July!  It was fun to see the rock climbers on the sheer face.  Also saw huge salamanders in the lake and a hummingbird. Spotted a moose on the drive up to parking area.  Things to be prepared for: very dusty, bugs (particularly flies) were bothersome (take repellent), horrible parking situation. We parked about a half mile away from the trail head"
254,2016-07-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful surroundings. Very busy on a Friday evening. Had to park at Catherine's Pass trailhead and walk the road. Lots of wedding and family photo groups in the meadows. But totally worth fighting the crowds to see the flowers, the lake, and a big bull moose lounging in the willows."
255,2016-07-22,['hiking'],A classic annual tradition for our family.  We see moose sometimes and salamanders in the water.  Beautiful wildflowers in June/July.  Great for all ages!
256,2016-07-21,['hiking'],Started below the meadows so it was about 6 miles round trip. Well worth continuing up to the lake. It gets steep and rocky just before getting the lake but it's not too hard. The salamanders in the lake were fun to watch.
257,2016-07-21,[''],Steep before you get to the lake but gorgeous the whole way!
258,2016-07-21,['hiking'],"It was a nice easy hike, had fun walking around the lake."
259,2016-07-20,['hiking'],"My four boys lived this trail!  We had to start further down because there was construction on the road before the parking lot but it was a lot of fun!  Saw two moose, a beaver and the lake has lizards!"
260,2016-07-20,['hiking'],"It was busy at the head of the trail so we started at least a mile below the actual trail around the lodge, then hiked all the way up. It was beautiful with all of the wild flowers. It was longer than expected with having to hike from the lodge, so if you go later on in the evening around 6 pm you might have to do the extra hike. But still worth it (however that may be too much for young kids). Loved it!"
261,2016-07-19,['hiking'],Easy and fun to go
262,2016-07-19,[''],"it was beautiful! relatively easy, and just gorgeous the whole way up!"
263,2016-07-19,[''],It was so amazing. We got up at 4 to make it to the lake by sunrise (we live about an hour and a half away) and the wildflowers are absolutely gorgeous. We also happened to come across a baby moose while watching the sunrise. Easy hike and lots of places to stop and look around!
264,2016-07-18,['hiking'],This hike is all uphill. It's really I love  pretty wild flowers and the creek is nice. We packed a picnic and ate at the lake. We parked in the lower Alta parking lot and joked through Albion meadows up to cecret lake.
265,2016-07-18,[''],Easy from campground. More difficult from Alta parking lot.
266,2016-07-17,['hiking'],Easy hike for young families. Scenic and well groomed.
267,2016-07-17,['hiking'],It's beautiful but I've seen less people at Costco on a Saturday afternoon. Way crowded. The elevation makes it a bit challenging but the flowers and trees are amazing.
268,2016-07-17,['hiking'],"Albion basin is stunning this time of year! Nice shirt hike to a lake with 360 beautiful views.  Great for kids.  Only complaints are no dogs, and busy parking lot"
269,2016-07-17,[''],"my 3 and 5 year Olds really enjoyed the hike. they're used to hiking, but we saw a lot of whinny kids."
270,2016-07-17,['hiking'],"Great hike. Right now the wild flowers are in bloom. If you have young children, the end of the hike as you approach the lake is very steep and has a lot of rocks. Our 2 year old struggled a bit at the end but our 7 year old did great."
271,2016-07-15,['hiking'],"We got there before 9 and the parking lot was nearly full.  The trail was crowded, not surprising since the lake is so beautiful!  It was a great hike with the kids."
272,2016-07-14,['hiking'],Trail was easy-going and well-maintained. We enjoyed lunch by the lake then walked all the way around. LOTS of bugs on the back side of the lake. Kids had fun exploring and was a beautiful view.
273,2016-07-14,['hiking'],"This was a great easy short hike, the gate is open since July 11, if you plan to hike this summer plan on getting there at 9am, the parking lot is full at 9:30 am. It's very crowded even during the week. Rather than that go hiking and enjoy the pretty wild flowers and beautiful lake, it's very cool like 67 degrees"
274,2016-07-13,[''],Beautiful hike . Lots of wildflowers & squirrel. Also saw a moose. The last quarter mile or so of the hike is really rocky & steep. Lake is beautiful. We left around 6:30p right as the crowd started to trickle in. Parking lot was full
275,2016-07-12,['hiking'],"The Albion Basin Road has not been open so the shuttle to the trail head isn't running. The Alta Lodge indicates that the road si scheduled to open Monday, 7/11/2016 which will make this an easier hike. I hiked this trail down from Germania pass as an extending hike. It was amazing to see the lake from above for the first time."
276,2016-07-10,[''],Difficult. Not easy.
277,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"Great trail for the novice who wants to enjoy the outdoors but not a strong hiker. About 3 miles from the bottom parking lot, through Albion basin and up to Cecret lake."
278,2016-07-09,[''],"Really beautiful destination. Short hike up a rocky path, but only moderately difficult. Most well-prepared kids can get this one done easily. Docking a star because I couldn't take a dip in the lake... no swimming!"
279,2016-07-07,['hiking'],"This is a great trail for beginning hikers or small children. Our daughter has been doing it since she was two. We love the wild flowers and looking for animals. Cecret Lake itself is quite pretty, too! When we want a longer hike, we take the Albion Meadows Trail to the Cecret Lake trailhead. It's very pretty in late summer when the wild flowers are in bloom."
280,2016-07-06,['hiking'],Great hike! Since the road was closed we took the Albion Meadows trail up to the connection and it was beautiful. Lots of wildflowers right now. Uphill the whole way but worth it!
281,2016-07-06,[''],"We loved this hike! We saw moose and deer and cool salamanders at the lake. I'd say it's more of a moderate hike and much longer, they've closed the road to the trail head so you have to hike to it which we were told was 2 miles, so it's roughly 6 miles in and out. It took us just under 3 hours, we were a little slow going though and there are a ton of shoot off trails and the signage wasn't good, so we had to keep asking if we were still going in the right direction :) I also took a million pictures because it was just beautiful! We were so glad we happened on this app and found this trail. It was not crowded, but it was a Tuesday night."
282,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Gorgeous! Followed the Albion Meadow trail all the way to the lake. Wildflowers were blooming in the meadow, so it was a perfect time to hike it. Clear trails were easy to follow. Cecret lake was peaceful and beautiful. We arrived around 6:30pm, when the light was soft. Will do this one again for sure!"
283,2016-06-28,['hiking'],Beautiful. Not many wild flowers in Albion Basin yet. Maybe more in a week or two.
284,2016-06-25,['hiking'],"The road was closed like the others have said, we have 3 kids and we had to turn back after 2 mi. in. We will def. be back, later when the road officially opens. from the walk in and out it was beautiful!"
285,2016-06-25,['hiking'],"The road is closed until July 11th so I had to hike in through the Albion Meadows Trail. Adds about 4 miles round trip but totally worth it and not very hard! Absolutely gorgeous. Saw 4 moose on the trail, but the weather was perfect and there was plenty of sun. Make sure you wear sunscreen and shoes you don't mind getting soaked, the streams run over the paths right now. Definitely one of my new favorites if you tie in the Albion Meadows Trail!"
286,2016-06-20,[''],The road isn't open to the trail head and then we were told that the trail still has snow on it. the rangers said that the trail doesn't officially open until 4th if July weekend.
287,2016-06-20,['hiking'],"This was a beautiful hike from the Alta base (Albion Basin Road is still closed as of 06/19/2016, the Town of Alta's website states it will be open July 11th), so we hiked through Albion Alps Meadow and pushed on to the lake.  The trail to the lake is easy to moderate with a series of switchbacks at the end in almost full sun.  It can be a bit tough and hot, so bring plenty of water.  It is a great hike with Devil's Castle high above you which gives an amazing backdrop to the lake.  I'm sure this hike is even better when the wildflowers are in blow later this summer."
288,2016-06-20,[''],"We parked at the Albion base area. From there, it's nearly three miles to the lake and all uphill. The last half mile was quite steep, very rocky and a steep ridge with a series of switchbacks. The trail is not marked except for one sign at the campground area. We have seen many reviews that describe this hike as easy. That may be the case if you have hiked extensively, are young or are very fit. If you are a little older and not very used to hiking, this trail is not easy but take your time and you can make it - take plenty of water. The last ridge is quite steep and high and may be a problem if you have a fear of hights. Once at the lake you are rewarded with an incredible site. Today, the lake was still half frozen and very beautiful."
289,2016-06-19,[''],the hike is very scenic. it's not a hard hike at all. this is one of my favorite hikes in the end of July when the wild flowers are in bloom.
290,2016-06-15,['hiking'],"Fun, easy hike with our young boys."
291,2016-06-13,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes to do with kids. Favorite time to go is about July when the flowers are in bloom. Super pretty hike and rewarding at the end.
292,2016-06-07,['hiking'],"There is still a ton of snow towards the top, and the gate is still closed. As of 6/7/16"
293,2016-06-02,[''],"Disappointed that the access dirt  road was closed today. The info says trail is open in June.  Perhaps end of June? I wanted to do this hike with my 2 and 5-year-old because it's short and we were staying in the Snowbird area. We did the White Pine Trail instead, just a tiny portion of it."
294,2016-05-30,[''],"The description says dogs allowed on leash, EPIC fail. No dogs allowed in the entire canyon."
295,2016-05-24,[''],Beautiful hike. Did it last spring. It smelled so amazing. So many pine trees.
296,2016-05-03,['hiking'],"Great quick hike. Perfect for beginners and to take relatives or visiting friends. Beautiful lake at the top with plenty of space to spread out and start getting away from the crowds. Definitively a busy hike, though - people every 100 yards or less until you reach the lake."
297,2016-04-25,['hiking'],"I love this trail, but I don't love the crowds. I've hiked this trail every summer since I was a toddler. The little lake is pretty, I almost always see moose, the wildflowers are beautiful, there's a little side trail where you can see a waterfall. The last four years, though, have been waaay too busy. I pretty sure this is the most popular trail in Northern Utah right now, and for good reason. If you want to hike it definitely go on a weekday and get there early because even then you'll have to be lucky to get a parking spot at the Albion Basin campground."
298,2016-04-15,[''],"great short hike for kids.  a star off because it's always busy,  but we love this area in the spring/summer"
299,2016-03-07,['hiking'],It was raining when I hiked but ceased just long enough to enjoy the lake right as I got to it.   Well worth the hike.  Trail gets extremely slick when wet.
300,2016-01-09,['hiking'],"beautiful hike year round, great for pictures. there are beautiful flowers on the way up. 
very easy hike. 
The lake water is super cold, and has little to no fish, but does contain salamanders! 

There is also a HIDDEN ABANDONED SILVER MINE entrance right on the trial, you'll miss it if you dont know its there. its a small hole under the large rock halfway up the trail. ice cold water comes up within a few meters of the entrance, so access to the rest is limited. after the entrance is a straight shaft that goes on for ~20 meters, then splits in two out of view of the entrance. rusty rail tracks can be seen here. 
 
CAUTION: This is an Abandoned mine shaft. This is very Dangerous. it could cave in at anytime, explore at your own risk."
301,2015-10-25,['bird watching'],Took the kids on a lazy Sunday Hike.  It was chilly but fun.  Lake was beautiful!
302,2015-10-16,['hiking'],"Beautiful lake it's definitely worth it! It's short and easy, the hardest part was right before the lake but even the was fairly easy. The only down side to this hike is that there is so many people around, I guess cecret lake isn't that much of a secret."
303,2015-10-14,['bird watching'],"Amazing views of wild life (birds, chick minks, salamanders, fish) even a adorable ""friendly"" moose at the top of the trail as you approach the lake. The elevation climb isn't easy but its main climb is at the very end through some switch backs- definitely worth it. This is a very kid friendly hike and a lot of families are up at the top hanging out and picnicking. On the downside it was a bit loud and crowded so if your looking for more solitude do the Lake Mary loop."
304,2015-10-07,[''],Awesome hike! It's so beautiful!
305,2015-10-01,['hiking'],"The lake is beautiful. And I'm betting that in the middle of summer, so are the windflowers. The trail itself is not anything exciting, though, and it is definitely crowded. We went in the middle of the day on a Tuesday, during the fall, and it was still pretty crowded. It is short, which I suppose is why this is classified as easy. It's not that it's very steep (although some sections near the lake are) but we ended up having to almost carry an older gentleman we met  halfway back down the trail because he was suffering from altitude sickness along with a hurt back. Their group had read that the trail was ""easy"" and so had decided to try it. I felt awful for them. I don't want to dissuade anyone from trying this trail, I think seeing the lake is worth the quick trip. And if you're used to the altitude and in reasonably good health, you won't have any trouble with it. But easy doesn't always equal a leisurely stroll. Especially not at 10,000 feet above sea level."
306,2015-09-25,['hiking'],"I hiked with a few friends in June while there was still some snow further up and the lake still had ice in it. It was a stunning view! Short hike, but definitely worth doing."
307,2015-09-20,[''],Easy day hike with great views of Little Cottonwood
308,2015-09-14,['hiking'],"This hike is one of my most favorite. It's beautiful. Surrounded by 6 or 7 peaks, including Devil's Castle which is glorious. It's not hard to get to the lake and relax. We spent a couple hours on the warm rocks over looking the water. It's perfect for a picnic date."
309,2015-09-11,['trail running'],"This hike was perfect!  It was just short enough to fit our schedule and we were rewarded with an awesome sunrise and some wonderful wildlife.  We saw a cow moose with her calf, 5 mule deer does and 1 mule deer buck.  The blue jays were all over the place.  

The views of the lake were spectacular.  It was really clear and beautiful.  I would call this an easy hike, but some many consider it moderate for it's steepness. One word of advice, the beginning of the trail shares a road for approximately 1/4 of a mile."
310,2015-09-10,['hiking'],Not an easy hike. At least moderate. it's very steep the whole hike but the view is beautiful.
311,2015-09-10,['hiking'],Some steep parts but so beautiful once you reach the little lake.
312,2015-09-08,['hiking'],"This is a great trail. It's not too far, but it's pretty steep in some places. There's a moose that apparently frequents the lake. The moose was there when I hiked it, and it was there when my friends hiked it a few weeks ago. The views from the mouth of the canyon, and all the way to the lake are pretty amazing."
313,2015-09-08,['hiking'],"We hiked Cecret Lake for the first time and it was a nice, beautiful hike on this perfect yet extremely busy Labor Day.  We've never done the watershed canyons because we hate leaving our dog at home, but it was a nice change from AF canyon.  We had a little picnic at the lake with our family before heading home and luckily because we have a handicap pass we were able to get one of the last parking spots.  The line for the shuttle was nuts!"
314,2015-08-30,[''],It was an amazing hike.  There was a rather large Moose feeding right by the lake.
315,2015-08-29,['hiking'],"This is a short 1 mile hike (1.6 km) at high elevation that ends at a lake. The drive through the canyon to get there is beautiful enough but so is the destination. Go slow on the road if your vehicle is low clearance.
Saw a large moose."
316,2015-08-29,['hiking'],"With lots of confusion we started our hike at the lodge of Alta Ski Resort, which made the hike almost 5-6 miles longer. If you are in good shape the hike is not too difficult, the View is phenomenal, we saw a moose at the lake also. Lots of family's on the trail who began the hike at the location given doing just fine! Would absolutely recommend!"
317,2015-08-28,[''],Fun and still felt like a good hike
318,2015-08-28,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes. A little tough but short. Nice views. I do it once every summer.
319,2015-08-25,['hiking'],My mom and I went on this hike later in the day on a Friday. The shuttle wasn't running anymore so we ended up hiking more than just the 1.6 miles. We were glad we did though because the wildflowers were just blooming. The most beautiful scenery I've seen in Utah. A few hikers said they say a moose. All we saw were little gophers and chipmunks. Saw a few mountain bikers as well. A fairly difficult hike for those not so avid hikers. Getting to the lake is worth it.
320,2015-08-24,[''],Nice short hike.
321,2015-08-18,[''],Popular trail. Lots of people on weekends. July and August there are many wildflowers. Look for salamanders in the lake.
322,2015-08-16,['hiking'],"Great beginner hike. The trail to the lake was a steady incline but saw lots of kids and families. I walked around the lake, there were parts where there was no ""trail"" and it was tricky so I wouldn't recommend kids doing that. Beautiful area bring a picnic lunch and sit under the shade when you go to the right side of the lake."
323,2015-08-15,['hiking'],"A nice trail that is easy if you start from the upper parking lot or moderate if you start at the bottom lot. The advantage to the lower lot is that you pass through the Albion meadow which has been filled with flowers both times I've hiked through.
One note of caution - this is a very popular trail and there are lots other hikers. On the weekends there is an overabundance of children, some of whom are very noisy! Go on a weekday if you want a quiet and peaceful hike"
324,2015-08-15,['walking'],"We went on July 3rd, hoping the trial wouldn't be too busy for a Friday morning. We had to take the shuttle at Alta to and from the trailhead. It was busier than we had hoped. There were many people on the trail that it made it almost not worth going. The steep part was tough with so many people going up and coming down.  The lake was just ok. There were too many people at the top to enjoy a peaceful mountain lake. All-in-all, I'm glad I went. I just don't think we will ever go again. 

Pros: pretty hike. 
Cons: too popular and busy. Little shade. Have to wait for the shuttle."
325,2015-08-11,['hiking'],"After doing a number of other hikes this summer, this one came a little short of my hopes. I think it's a perfect hike for a family with small children. For more experienced hikers, the drive to the trailhead took at least twice as long (coming from South Salt Lake) than the trail itself. It was a nice, easy trail. Quick and pretty views! The other thing I didn't like is that it was SO CROWDED. We had to walk single file for half of the hike up. But, great views if you're looking for a short, family friendly hike."
326,2015-08-08,[''],"This hike is fantastic! The hike is short and a little steep in some spots but well worth the work for the views at the top! We hiked around the whole lake on a trail that's slightly challenging to navigate but we saw 9 different species of wildlife including pikas, a marmot, salamanders, tons of birds, chipmunks and rock chucks! Only remaining creature to see would be moose, and we are heading back soon to try for that since we saw signs of moose present on the trail. This is a great hike for any able bodied family member and so easy to get to!"
327,2015-08-08,[''],"Amazing! My best friend and I went on a cooler day in August and it was a little chilly at first, but as you get moving we warmed up. 

Trail is easy, family friendly, and absolutely gorgeous. We saw so much wildlife up there too. Marmot (only for a few seconds), a pika, tons of different birds and even some moose poop. My friend and I hiked all around the lake snapping beautiful photos. 

I will definitely go back again"
328,2015-08-08,[''],Beautiful hike. Short and sweet!
329,2015-08-08,['hiking'],Great family hike. Kids really enjoyed the multiple boulders available to climb on and watching the numerous tiger salamander larvae swimming in the lake.
330,2015-08-05,['hiking'],"Cecret Lake is a great family friendly hike! On weekends it is very busy, and the Cecret Lake parking area fills quickly, so get there early. We always like to do this one midweek, because there aren't as many people. 

I've seen moose just above Cecret Lake on multiple occasions. The last stretch of switchbacks to the top do a good job reducing the incline of the last little bit.

331,2015-08-04,['horseback riding'],"Another journey to a new destination. The Alta Ski resort in little cottonwood canyon has long been on my destinations to see. Finally, I resolved to make the trip before the autumn snows claimed it. Setting off in the a.m, too late actually but I pressed on. Unfortunately, I forgot a number of things like a hat, water and real food. If Lutgart would have been with me this would have all been in order but she was nursing our lab Bailey who was attacked by something (raccoon?) and had her chest scratched so badly she received stitches so Lutgart stayed home. Driving through the canyons, I arrived at warm site next to the Alta ski resort. After securing water and some snacks off I went to Cecret lake, no problem...or so I thought. I started my trip at 8950ft for elevation. This changed and quickly. I was huffing and puffing five minutes into my journey and the sun was already too high for my liking. Did I mention I forgot my hat? Anyway, I was not disappointed by the views and they only improved as I walked. Beautiful fields of flowers, reds, yellows and purple dominated the fields with the mountains. Gorgeous but the walk up had my attention. I consider myself a decent hiker but I was feeling this. Hmmm, am I actually short of breath? Yes. I do love the land but I detest man's ability to ruin it. In the middle of this beauty is a ski resort. You can't miss it. And the lifts abandoned for the summer but don't worry. They'll be back with the first snow. We just can't leave well enough alone can we? Keep pushing but I am being punished for my late start. People. Too many people. Families, screaming children, overprotective parents. They are all there. I'll be honest I'm annoyed. 

One of the attractions for me of hiking and photography is the solitude. I think. I appreciate and dream a little. But that is impossible this morning. I've been zigzag walking for about an hour now and the sign informs me ""Cecret Lake"" 1.6 miles. The woods and shade beckon but I'm seriously considering whether to go because I know I will have company. Well, I'm here so I go. The woods are cool and I enjoy some moments of respite from the heat and the crowds. Gorgeous scenery but damn near impossible to photograph with the deep shadows. A mini-waterfall tempts me but I resist, eager to get the walk on. I hear more people and spot a campground in front of me full of human beings and loud ones at that. What did I expect? I veer right and follow the path of solitude. I encounter 3 young lads ahead of me speaking a language that sounded Russian but I was wrong. They were from the republic of Czech. They greeted me with a good morning in perfect English, very good! I stop to rest. The land continues to elevate and I'm really overheating. Fortunately I bought two bottles of water and I'm very thankful I had the patience to wait for the store to open. The path continues and merges as I'm joined by families all on the road to Cecret Lake. Abruptly, the woods end and a huge field emerges with a path straight through. Fields of flowers loom and the elevator continues to rise up. In the distance I can see groups of people ahead of me and at this point I think ""How much further can this be??"". The land laughs and I get my answer ""Further than you want"". 

Then I see it. Not the lake but the path TO the lake and this is not good. Well, if you were not prepared it is not good. For me to reach the lake I can't even see I have to climb the mountain! A very rocky path at that in the blazing sun. I'm tired, getting hungry and my eyes are burning from sweat. Am I really going to do this? Then I see him. Walking slow with a cane. Slightly hunched over. He must be in his late 70's, minimum. And he is doing it, up, slowly up, step after step. My God! I'm ashamed. This gentlemen wants to see the lake and he is going to do it. I take a deep breath as young people sprint by me. Seemed like they were sprinting at the moment at least. I put down my tripod, my camera, and take off my backpack and have a drink. I pour some on my head washing the burn out. Did I mention I had company? Horseflies. Some fast, some slow but always there. When I stop they seize their moment and attack. I kill one (I have fast reflexes!) and nearly kill his brother. Time to go and so I do. I cross the timeless desert, this Mojave of the mind and continue my journey. From a photography perspective this is stupid. Any experienced photographer reading this is shaking his head and thinking ""This clown is much too late. He should have been at the lake at sunrise when the walk would have been much cooler and he would have been alone."" I can't argue any of that. But the old man shamed me so I cross the burning land and start my final ascent to the mount. My legs are burning and I'm definitely struggling for my breath. Wow, haven't felt this way in a while. I catch the old gent and he greets me with a hello, I nod and press. I still can't see the lake and the switchbacks are getting tediou"
332,2015-08-03,[''],"Beautiful! The wildflowers are in bloom! I went with friends and our children ranging in age 4-9 and we all had a blast. The kids loved the hike and the lake. We spent almost 1hr up at the lake having a picnic. Even though it rained as we arrived at the base, it was still perfect weather for this short easy hike. The last stretch is going uphill through some rocks so make sure to wear appropriate shoes/sandals. Parking can be complicated but there are shuttles every 15min. Will definitely do this again! :)"
333,2015-07-31,[''],I'm tempted to give this 3 stars bc of the parking alone. We got there on a Thursday at 10 am and had to park 1 mile away from the trailhead. The trail itself was beautiful! The wild flowers are in bloom right now and makes it so worth it. There's a few slick rocks you climb/walk on but not difficult at all. And there are 3 switchbacks at the top with no shade but it's less than 1/2 mile. My 4 yr old did this with no problems at all.
334,2015-07-27,['hiking'],"Great hike, my husband and I choose to start at the grill and walk through the Albion Meadow and it was beautiful! Once we got to the actual Cecret Lake trail head it got a lot more crowded, but it was Sunday afternoon, I'd definitely  recommend a weekday if you want to avoid crowds. There were quite a few people with kids and I look forward to taking mine another time, but based on what I saw, it looked a little rough for toddlers."
335,2015-07-26,['hiking'],"We wandered off the easy family path and climbed up and around the backside of the lake. We actually  had no idea if the path would loop but wanted to avoid  the crowds and noise. Worked out great! Stunning views, no one else on the trail, and we ended up on the side of the lake with hardly anyone! The path less traveled  paid off-but it is not easy. Definitely  doing it again! 
And the Wildflowers are out of control!! Be sure to walk back to the Alta base. It is magical!"
336,2015-07-24,['hiking'],"WILDFLOWER ALERT!  It is time to take this hike.  The wildflowers are out in full glory.  The colors are spectacular.  Plants are tall with abundant blooms from the spring rains. At the end, the view of the alpine lake under the rugged cliffs is an added payoff.  Yes, lots of people up there right now, but worth the annoyance."
337,2015-07-20,[''],"Easy, great views, go early, the crowds pickup fast."
338,2015-07-19,['hiking'],Really pretty and fairly easy short hike. BUT we went on a Sunday morning and it was crowded with lots of screaming and crying kids. Go early or on a weekday.
339,2015-07-15,['hiking'],"Great trail, mostly an easy walk. There were a few spots that were rocky and were slick because of the dirt on them. My kids were able to do it (5,7) however there were some steep switchbacks. Not quite as easy as I thought it would be, but nonetheless still good."
340,2015-07-15,[''],"Great, we went just a few days before the gate opened to had to add a few miles to the hike. Beautiful lake, and we took a different trail on the way back that was to the west of the lake and past the chair lifts. Saw two moose as well!"
341,2015-07-14,['hiking'],"The hike was great, weather cool and nice parking was a nightmare!"
342,2015-07-14,[''],This was the perfect first day hike while getting acclimated to the altitude. Pretty crowed but very nice views. Perfect time of year with all the beautiful wild flowers. Saw a cow moose and her two calves.
343,2015-07-12,[''],Great short hike to the lake. Nice and cool up there too
344,2015-07-12,['walking'],Beautiful scenery and a great view at the end of the trail! Definitely one to do again!
345,2015-07-11,[''],Awesome little hike with a beautiful lake at the end.
346,2015-07-08,[''],Beautiful hike but it is up hill the entire way with a very steep and narrow path at the very end. It was not easy for me as a beginner(and former smoker) who carried 40 lbs of kid and gear in a carrier on my back. But so worth it! The lake is breathtaking! And the wildflowers are blooming and gorgeous right now!
347,2015-07-08,[''],It was beautiful. The wild flowers are gorgeous. Very easy and short hike but the views were breath taking
348,2015-07-07,['hiking'],"Great hike for kids! Our three older kids (11, 9 and 6) hiked it without any problems. I carried our baby in a backpack carrier. Short hike, beautiful views and gorgeous destination. Stayed at the lake for at least two hours before heading back. Very busy. I'd recommend visiting on a weekday."
349,2015-07-06,['hiking'],"Great hike with 4 kids (9, 6, 4, 2). Beautiful views along the way with a gorgeous lake at the end!"
350,2015-07-05,['fishing'],"Beautiful hike with kids in tow (5,7,10 and 11). The wildflowers had just begun to bloom--another week and it is going to be gorgeous. The kids caught mudpuppies and salamanders. Beware of the Mosquitos!"
351,2015-06-28,[''],The gate to the trailhead opens July 1. Plan on an extra 2 miles round trip if you go before then.
352,2015-06-28,['hiking'],"The gate to the actual trailhead was closed when I went, it added about a mile to our journey. It was about 5.5 miles round trip. Totally worth it. The wild flowers weren't quite out but probably will be within the next couple weeks."
353,2015-06-27,['cross country skiing'],Fine
354,2015-06-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. The end is quite difficult
For a 3 or 4 year old.  Aggressive rodents at the lake where everyone had their snack :)

Quite busy and you may not be able to go if you can't find parking. It's at a dead end and no parking along the road."
355,2015-05-30,[''],The area is beautiful and the hike is very manageable
356,2015-04-06,['hiking'],"Somehow we got way off course on this trail and it ended up taking us 2 hours to find it. It began snowing and getting really windy when we got to the top, towards the lake, so we really didn't enjoy it. This may be a more fun hike in the spring, summer or fall."
357,2015-03-20,['hiking'],"I've done this trail probably a dozen times. It always provides a nice stroll in the mountains, Short enough to enable anyone to do it, but just long enough to make you feel like you actually hiked. In July the wildflowers are out of this world. For some extra adventure I recommend continuing up the trail into upper Albion Basin, and even up to the summit of Sugarloaf where you will be rewarded with some tremendous views of the entire basin and the Southern Wasatch."
358,2014-10-11,[''],Busy trail. Kids trail
359,2014-10-10,['hiking'],"This is a fun, kid friendly hike with a great lake at the end."
360,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"First time I hiked up, I thought it was the most beautiful lake I'd ever seen but after discovering more hiking trails with lake views, I've had to rethink that. Lol. But overall, it's an easy friendly hike. Lots of people on the trail and fun for kids to tag along! Very short and easy. Enjoyed Cecret Lake."
361,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"been up this trail about 4 times this summer, beautiful and worth it! easy hike, definitely recommended for family hikes! I LOVE UTAH!"
362,2014-09-04,['hiking'],Amazing!
363,2014-08-29,[''],I need to add more to my review seeing as there is plenty of negative below. I went on a Wednesday so there were very few people there at the time. There was one other person there. Yes you don't forget you're on a ski resort but it's an easy quick escape from the busy city life below.
364,2014-08-12,[''],"Beautiful hike, not too long but scenic with wildflowers in abundance (August). I had read many accounts being family friendly so I chose to bring my 4 and 7 year old. It was a bit intense at the end for my youngest, but we made it and the lake was spectacular so a nice payoff. Bring a jacket - the temp dropped 30 degrees up there. Nice hike!"
365,2014-08-11,['hiking'],"Very pretty. Very easy.  I would highly recommend for people who are not able to make strenuous hikes or for small children. The downside is only that it is super crowded. I went there as an easy place to get to and chill out after a long long 20 mile hike, but there was dozens of shouting and crying kids. ... If u want seclusion and quiet, you wont likelygetit here."
366,2014-07-30,[''],"I hope I am not being too harsh but giving this trail more than 3 stars seems wrong.  Its a good hike, nice wildflowers when in season and quite a bit cooler than the city. But, there is evidence of ski infrastructure everywhere and that is a 2 star deduction in my opinion.  Parts of the hike and especially the lake are diminished by the scars of the resort operations. You never seem to forget that you are right in the middle of a ski resort. Other than that, it's a nice way to spend a Saturday afternoon."
367,2014-06-12,['hiking'],"If you are hiking from Albion Campground, Cecret Lake is the first stop on the way to the tram.  Cecret Lake is a great hike for inexperienced hikers and visitors.  Minimal danger.  Great place to take the family and photos.  If this seems too easy or crowded, continue passed the lake to the saddle and follow to Baldy, that will connect you to the tram, which is a free ride down to Snowbird.  Amazing hike.  Wildflowers are abundant.   Wildlife everywhere.   Snow  remains in the area until August most years.  Be extra careful negotiating snowfields."
368,2014-06-02,[''],"I enjoy this hike, which is fairly easy, and I can bring my non-hiker friends along. It is always busy and the parking lot is always full. Definitely easier to take the shuttle (and I would rather not drive my car on the last part of the road leading up, which us dirt). Beautiful wildflowers in later summer."
369,2014-04-26,['hiking'],"My family and I love this hike. We see moose almost every time we go. Parking was a problem. But last year they had a free shuttle that took us from Alta to the trailhead. Great idea. My younger child can do this no problem, it is sort -of gradual until you get close to the lake, then it gets much steeper and rocky up to the lake. There are salamanders, huge fossil rocks, tons of mountain wildflowers, shallow streams, and moose. Be careful about the moose! Eager photographers getting too close caused a bull moose to stand up and snort at the crowd. The person who provokes a moose may be able to get away but there are kids and older ones around so it is good to not just think of yourself and ignore safety. We had to leave an area where we were viewing two bulls and a cow because photographers were getting too close and making the moose nervous. Bring a zoom lens, and be safe. I would give this hike 5 stars but the trail is always crowded, and for us that's a negative. Every other aspect of this I trail is great!"
370,2013-09-30,['hiking'],Great Hike! Almost got caught in a snowstorm.. But we finished the hike pretty quick! I'd say a notch above easy! 
371,2013-09-03,['hiking'],"This hike was perfect for our Labor Day family venture. Our 3 year old was able to complete it without too much difficulty.. We were lucky enough to snatch a parking spot, I'd recommend that if you see an open spot at Catherine Pass take it & walk to to this hike, it's less than 1/4 mile. "
372,2013-09-01,['hiking'],"Awesome trail, moderate towards the end. Great view at the top, so worth the hike!"
373,2013-08-09,['hiking'],Pretty little evening hike. I notice a lot of the popular hiking trails around Salt Lake are way less crowded in the late afternoon and evening. Short and sweet with lots of wildflower and great info signs along the way.
374,2013-07-30,['hiking'],Love this hike. Perfect mix of easy and hard for little kids. We love to catch salamanders in the lake and rock climb at the bottom of the waterfall. 
375,2013-07-28,['hiking'],"The parking at the Basin is usually full, so plan on taking the shuttle up, which is usually a 10-15 minute wait. The hike itself is rather easy with a steady incline. The best views are above the lake. Make sure to venture out! "
376,2013-07-25,['hiking'],"Beautiful wild flowers in late July. Significant incline, and dusty trail. Wear shoes with decent traction to avoid slipping. Lake is also beautiful reflecting the sky and mountains around it. Access road was closed in June, so this most likely a late summer hike."
377,2013-07-22,['hiking'],overcrowded and way too many little kids running around a screaming. it's a real short hike that goes up to a not so impressive lake. the trail was so crowded that there were many times where we had to wait for a group of 10 people to pass before continuing. never again would I bother going here.
378,2013-07-21,['hiking'],"Must go in July, beautiful wildflowers all along!"
379,2013-06-28,['hiking'],Kids friendly with a few boulders along the road side and streams for rock climbers. A lovely and relaxed morning off
380,2013-06-22,['hiking'],I love hiking the trails that cross over the ski trails that you ski during the winter! This trail has several meadows with great wild flowers a bloom. The lake is worth the hike and neat to check out.
381,2013-06-06,['hiking'],"Great hike, worth the work to get to the lake"
382,2013-05-30,['hiking'],"as of may 30th 2013, we dove up the canyon and got to where the trail was suppose to be it was 38 degrees and the snow was still fairly deep. will be back maybe in july when all the snow is actually gone."
383,2013-05-27,['hiking'],Went on this hike with my wife who isn't a hiker. She thought that it was a hard hike. I've been hiking for years and with the exception of the last climb to the lake I thought that this that is was easy. Very crowded trail
384,2012-09-05,['hiking'],The people who rate this trail as easy haven't been on the lower third of the Provo River Trail.   Easy to me is F L A T.  This wasn't flat. It's moderate in my books. Another trail that people I know couldn't do and would have been disappointed to find it as hard vs easy. Beautiful scenery.
385,2012-08-23,['hiking'],"Easy. Brought my 3yr old with us. Only strain is the last 40 yards or so, up a switchback. No fish that I could find. A little shade for lunch time."
386,2012-08-06,['hiking'],"I've been exploring Utah all summer and this is one of my favorite hikes we've done. It's quick and easy but the view is breathtaking. On weekends parking at the trailhead is limited so they offer a free shuttle from the ski lodge. You can camp here at the lake but there are no fish that I noticed besides these huge mutated salamander looking things!
There are tons of wildflowers on the way up, I'd definitely recommend this hike for families. "
387,2012-07-17,['hiking'],"The hike up was gorgeous.  Amazing views and alpine wildflowers.  I was amazed at all the flowers.  The lake was perfect, except for the thousands of mosquitos we didn't come quite prepared for.  Soon after arriving at the lake, the thunder clouds rolled in.  Weather changes fast at that elevation.  The run down was nothing short terrifying.  Keep on eye on the sky at over 9,000 feet.  It was an amazing adrenaline rush."
388,2012-07-08,['hiking'],Loved this hike! It was so beautiful with wildflowers everywhere. We hiked from Alta station so the hike was about 2.8 to the lake. On the way to the lake there is quiet a bit of up hill to the lake. We encountered a thunderstorm on the way back and it actually got pretty cold as it started hailing and this is July so next time I will be more prepared and bring a light jacket! We also saw a beautiful Moose along the way.
389,2012-06-29,['hiking'],We just went to the Lake but it was GORGEOUS! and pretty easy for the kids!! Didn't know the road was closed so It was a lot longer than the 1.6. Wish we would have brought a lunch.
390,2012-06-09,['hiking'],One of the better hikes in SLC. 
391,2012-01-12,['nature trips'],"I have hiked this trail many times. It is relatively easy, but at altitude, which can be a concern for those who live at lower elevations. Depending on when you do this hike, the wildflowers are spectacular!!! What is in bloom changes throughout the hiking season. The views are wonderful, and take a picnic to hang out at the lake. Can be a bit busy depending on when you go, but worth it nevertheless."
392,2011-10-10,['hiking'],"Went twice.  First time was with friends to the lake and then up to the saddle.  It was busy until the lake, then we were pretty much alone.  Lots of little kids.  A great lake to take kids to.  Beautiful views and wildflowers.

The second time (date of review) I went alone past the saddle and up to the Sugarloaf Peak (11056 ft).  It was the ""last day of fall"" because the next day there was a blizzard at the top the mountain!  That made it even more enjoyable knowing that I squeezed in this hike just before it wouldn't be possible without snow gear until next summer.  Since it was a weekday, there were only a handful of other people on the trail to the lake.  After that, I was alone the whole time.  So peaceful (and windy) at the top!  I really enjoyed taking in the views.  With the sheer drop-off down the lake from the peak, it gave the illusion that I could jump into the lake from the peak.  Of course, the water would feel like concrete from that height...  :)"
393,2011-09-08,['hiking'],"Great for my family with our 4 year old.  The hike was very entertaining for our son.  Quite enjoyable.  Fairly crowded though.
At the top we found some Barred Tiger Salamanders in Larval form swimming in the lake.  main attraction for most people."
394,2011-07-21,[''],"Didnt get a chance to hike the trail. According to the police in Alta...Dogs are not allowed so I would take the ""Dog Friendly"" off the trail description. I will return to hike the trail soon."
395,2011-07-09,['hiking'],"Fairly easy trail with good opportunities for seeing wild life and wild flowers. Saw a moose in the meadow on the way up to the lake, and the lake itself is home to many salamanders."
