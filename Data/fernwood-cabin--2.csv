This hike however is literally always up until you get to the plateau before the cabin. No coverage. The trail is hard to find, because its not really marked. But once youre on it, then youre good. The cabin is okay, but i imagined more from it. But still picturesque views of the valley over Layton."

3,2019-06-17,['hiking'],"Steep, lots of sun unless you leave early in the morning. There is a stream or spring at the cabin but I don’t know if it is ok to drink. Great vistas. I’ve hiked this maybe ten times and saw some type of snake only once."

6,2018-10-24,[''],Did not realize that this was on the site.  It use to be a little secret that not many people could find.  This is a fun place to visit.
7,2018-05-24,['hiking'],Good hike up to the cabin and back. Definitely a cooler weather hike.  Not sure about winter but fall and spring would be delightful. Tons of sun exposure so bring plenty of water and sunscreen.  The only relief from the sun was around the cabin. The rattlesnakes were also out in force today! Please take caution with kids and pets. The hike gets a little steep in spots with lots of loose rocks where footing can be an issue. I am glad I didn’t bring my black lab with me. Too much sun and so little water available. I’ll be back once the cool weather settles back during the late fall.

It can be accessed via other routes that connect to this trail, but for the sake of preventing confusion, I recommend beginning at the Fernwood Recreation parking lot. I knew this cabin existed, I just had a somewhat difficult time finding any solid info online regarding it as the single in-an-out destination alone, by itself. About halfway up to Thurston Peak, there is a trail that veers off to the right into some trees. I missed it entirely, climbing an extra 1000+ft. before realizing I must've passed it already lol (d'oh!). On the way back down, I watched more closely for any signs of the cabin, and sure enough... had I been paying closer attention in the first place, I probably would have noticed it before. Depending on the season, you can see the green roof of the cabin peeking through the trees. It's a pretty run down little cabin, in fact its completely missing an entire wall. Kinda creepy, but still super cool none the less. This trail is very steep, particularly once you've passed the cabin (this is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars - I am not a fan of super steep lol). It goes without saying that bringing plenty of water is a must, especially during the afternoon/evening hours. Also, beware of rattlesnakes! This trail is riddled with them. However, if you don't bother them, they're just fine with your presence and won't bite you if you just walk around them (imagine that!). Again, not a favorite of mine, but it's one that I can now cross off the bucket list."

10,2017-04-12,[''],Excellent for trail running and gorgeous scenery!!
11,2016-10-07,['hiking'],"Good hike for the fall and spring months because it is mostly exposed, which would be miserable during the summer months. It has many climbs and a few steep hills which would be difficult for winter snowshoeing or even with crampons. Some cyclist on the trail. You can hear the highway noises crisply (hwy89) but throughout some of the hike you can also hear the river.  Overall it was a nice hike."
12,2016-06-05,[''],"Great views. Fun trail, but it is getting overgrown. It takes some searching at times to stay on the trail. Not a big deal with very little chance of getting lost, but be aware."
13,2016-05-30,[''],Fun for the kids ages 3-6 beautiful and tons of awesome flowers!!!
14,2016-05-01,['hiking'],"Nice trail, I would say it was ""hard"".."
15,2016-04-20,['hiking'],Nice.
16,2015-11-14,[''],great trail. awesome views.
17,2013-06-02,['hiking'],A nice network of trails that lay between the Kays Creek North Fork and South Fork. Some areas can be slippery due to steep inclines and loose gravel. Much of the trail does not have cover and is in direct sunlight all day so bring head cover and lots of water. The trail us used by hikers and trail runners and its proximity to housing makes it a high use trail network.
