0,2019-09-05,['hiking'],really nice trail. we go hiking with the dog and we had so much fun.
1,2019-09-02,['hiking'],don’t on labor day
2,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Went on Labor Day. Good hike for kids, but the trail was really crowded with people who had poor hiking etiquette. Large groups (15-20 people) from the summit would steamroll downhill without yielding to uphill traffic. And some impatient hikers stuck behind large groups were hitting people with their poles. We went up the shortcut, rocky path. Our kids (8 and 6) enjoyed that part, and I went up and down it with a toddler in a backpack without an issue. It seemed to save a lot of distance versus continuing on the trail until the tree roots."
3,2019-09-01,['hiking'],"Definitely bring a pack with warm cloths for the top of you plan to beat sunrise. I was training for Nepal so I had a pack with 50lbs of appropriate gear.  

A Jet boil for coffee/tea (tip- keep the fuel warm..near your body otherwise it can have trouble lighting) and if you have a Nalgene, it makes a great hot water bottle you can hold or stuff in your jacket.

4,2019-09-01,['hiking'],Scout falls is a beautiful double waterfall. The hike is fairly easy & beautiful with loads of mini waterfalls along the way. This is a great hike for kids. You could easily miss the turn to the waterfall so we made a video to make sure you don't miss it. Click on this link https://youtu.be/5iBDTVjPxvE
5,2019-08-30,['hiking'],"I loved this one. Was not hard but great scenery along the way. Not very shaded but it was overcast Ed and raining when we went and it was awesome. Make sure to climb over the big tree at the end to get there. Not a lot of sitting room at the top. And when you get past one stream, take a right to get up to the falls. Otherwise it takes you to a spot lower and you can’t get up that way. We also crossed several streams and our feet were wet. "
6,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']","This was a great trail. 3 1/2 hours round trip with 2 kids, ages 5 and 8 carrying their own camelbacks. The wildflowers are in bloom so expect lots of bees and butterflies. A bit muddy in spots and lots of small creeks to cross on the way up. Lots of sun at the beginning but became really shaded and cool about half way up. The falls themselves are hard to find, we overshot them and climbed a bit more up the trail. We soon came to a meadow that had a few streams trickling down and realized the falls were below us. We went back down to the corner of the switchback where the falls are the loudest. The falls are down a trail that goes to the left, when you're going up,  where the rocks are lined up looking to block the trail. Go down this a bit and you'll see some huge tree roots to climb up, then the rocky two waterfalls are right ahead. Very cold water and breathtaking views. I'm excited to hike this again in the fall! "

8,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'muddy']","*Never actually found the waterfall up close* **This highlighted map doesn’t actually take you to the falls, but to a plateau with beautiful views! which is why I give it 4 stars. 

Beautiful moderate hike with several little waterfalls through the trail that you have to cross, very beautiful. Our 9 and 12 year old did great until we came face to face with a moose on the trail about half way up! Luckily enough people came by that we spooked him off the trail and could continue. We followed this map and it takes you to a plateau with amazing views. You can hear the waterfall from there but cannot see it. We tried a few off shoot trails on the way up, and the second one you can sort of barely see the falls. 
"
9,2019-08-16,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, lots of wildflowers, I liked having poles and spikes available for the 5-6 snow patches that were on a slope. Have seen recommendations for sliding down snow on garbage bags; be careful as sharp rocks can be just under surface (as noted by friend who cut and broke his arm doing it as well as a ranger who has seen incidents)."
10,2019-08-15,['hiking'],Easy going fun hike! So beautiful this time of year!
11,2019-08-12,['hiking'],love this hike as you get closer to the falls the sound is amazing it almost sounds like a car
12,2019-08-11,['hiking'],our favorite hike in the area.  tons of waterfalls...my dog loved it. have to climb a few tree roots to get to the big waterfall but totally worth it. there is snow at the top and it keeps going but we just stopped at the end of the mapped trail. would say moderate terrain but not difficult at all.
13,2019-08-11,['hiking'],This trail was a little steep but very doable. Along the way there are pretty wildflowers and the cutest little waterfalls along the path on the way up. Its plenty shaded in areas and easy to follow. Once you get to the top it is a little tricky and lots of rocks to climb over. The views are beautiful though! I would definitely recommend trying it out at least once! 
14,2019-08-11,['hiking'],Amazing hike. We didn’t really see the falls from the top but we might have stopped too soon. We did get to see a moose!!
15,2019-08-10,['hiking'],We took our mini golden doodle and our four kids. It was a perfect hike since it’s not too long. We crossed a few streams and the mosquitos were really only bad in one spot. The view is incredible and the trail is in the shade for most of the afternoon. Recommended for people of all ages. We’ll definitely visit this trail again. 
16,2019-08-09,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']",
17,2019-08-08,['hiking'],what a beautiful hike! Our favorite so far this summer. We counted 24 waterfalls that we saw or walked past or through.  The flowers are in bloom and everything is so plush and green. If you are considering this hike stop thinking and go do it! GORGEOUS! When you think you're at the end of the trail climb the tree roots and keep going. 
18,2019-08-06,['hiking'],"Still a favorite! The 3, 4 and 6 year olds all hiked the whole way and were so entertained by all the fun stream crossings/bridges. It was pretty busy on Saturday and THE MOSQUITOS AT THE FALLS WERE HORRIBLE, but everything was lush and beautiful!"
19,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"Trail is easy to follow and easy to hike on without paying a lot of attention to where you step.   Beautiful views, as well as hearing stream or falls almost the whole time.   Saw moose with young one.  With snowfall so heavy this year, there is plenty of water over the falls even though this is August already.  Very enjoyable hike.  Can continue up to Timp peak if desired but this is much farther up the trial.  "
20,2019-08-04,['hiking'],I hiked this trail with my favorite 4 year old hiker. He walked the entire way. It was beautiful. Bring bug spray and shoes that you can hike in and still get wet. There were a lot of little runoffs that I think added to the hike but def got our feet wet. My 4 year old climbed up the tree roots fine at the end but I recommend having another adult to help with that part of the hike. Overall amazing! 
21,2019-08-04,['hiking'],Awesome views and perfect for kids! Took my 5 year old daughter and she was able to walk the whole thing
22,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Beautiful, heavily trafficked trail. Little scramble to the falls at the end. Just about 2.7 roundtrip."
23,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'over grown', 'rocky']","It was AMAZING! Loved this hike. I’m not fit or anything like that but I love hiking and this was a good one, will most certainly do it again and again. "
24,2019-08-02,['hiking'],"This was a beautiful hike! There was plenty of shade and so much green! Read others  reviews on here for good directions.  You do cross over the streams a few times and at one point, after crossing a bigger stream, when you are closer to the falls, there is a sharp right, go that way, if you go left (well, straight) it takes you to a part that isn't an approved path and its super rocky. Go right on the path (it takes you away from the falls, but you will switch back) and about another .25 miles you will get to what looks like a dead end, just climb over the giant tree with its roots and you will see the falls and be back on the path! My daughter and I had the falls to our selves! Im assuming everyone else went further to Timpanogos. "
25,2019-07-31,['hiking'],"This trail is gorgeous!  (7/30/2019)  It winds through aspens and wildflowers and has stunning views in every direction.  You can see the falls for a good portion of the hike which kept the kids motivated.  As others have mentioned, it feels counterintuitive to turn right and continue up the trail away from the falls, but not only is that the easiest, less treacherous way to go, it is also incredibly beautiful.  Be sure to continue across the planked pathways and up until the trail leads back toward the falls.  Once you get to the tree roots, climb on up and enjoy three pretty falls along the cliff side.  What an incredible view from up there!  Our waterproof hiking boots came in clutch with all the stream crossings, though my boys were happy to get their tennis shoes wet.  We started about 6pm and had shade the whole way.  At first we had the trail to ourselves, but then it got a little crowded.  According to the ol’ van, it was 105 degrees when we got off the freeway, 75 at the trailhead, and I’m guessing 55 at the falls with all the mist.  When we got back to the car it was 60 degrees.  This hike is a soul-satisfying way to beat the heat!"
26,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"Great family hike! Easy enough for beginners, just enough challenge to make it feel like an adventure.  Beautiful views the entire hike, flowers, water crossings, lots of shade, and amazing falls at the end. Highly recommend!  The only downside was the volume of hikers late morning. Trail is only wide enough for one person, so lots of breaks to let others pass going/coming."
27,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"3 Falls for the price of one. Tons of water flowing, easy hike to the turn-off. Go up to the second log up the big tree roots to go right to the falls. "
28,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","This was a relatively easy hike up to the falls, a little wet, it had rained the night before and rained a little bit on the way up as well, but it wasn't bad at all. 
The falls are absolutely phenomenal! The whole place just takes your breath away. Highly recommend! "
29,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Sign was down at the turn to the falls and I made the mistake of following the map on here. Luckily figured out this map was sending me away from the Falls. Beautiful hike otherwise.
30,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"A good hike, but not the most exciting"
31,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"Nice easy trail. Easy to miss the turn to stay on main trail instead of ending up walking up the rocks and water. Not bad though
FYI yesterday 7/24/2019 found a flashlight of the trail before the falls not sure if it was somebody hiking timp or the falls. Wonder if I might be able to reunite this flashlight with its owner. "
32,2019-07-25,['hiking'],Summer monsoon chased us back to the car halfway to the falls. Still fun though!!
33,2019-07-25,['hiking'],Beautiful and super kid friendly!  I don’t recommend kids climbing the rocks at the falls.  It is hard to get back down.  
34,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"Hiked 7/23/19 12pm: It was over 100 degrees in the valley today but only about 85 up here and plenty of shade and water aground to make this hike totally doable. Beautiful views through the canyon and lots of little stream crossings. I wore bug spray and wasn’t bothered. The falls are super awesome. This was my first time here, but I’ve heard this year is much more epic than other years. "
35,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
36,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"I loved this hike. I was grateful for the reviews that let me know to climb up the upturned tree at the end to get to the falls. They were so beautiful and there were many small falls along the way if you can’t make it all the way up. Yes, our feet got wet, but it felt great. Nothing scary. 
It was shady in many spots. I don’t think it’s really 4.2 miles. I think it’s closer to 3 miles. Not many people on the trail on Tuesday morning. Can’t wait to hike it again. "
37,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky']",This was very pretty! It goes from easy to harder quick tho. A lot of up hill. Lots of flies and mosquitos this year so watch for that. Lots of dust too. We all got dirty.
38,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"Great hike! Did this hike today (Monday) and we had the trail and the falls all to ourselves! Please read others reviews because this trail does come to a “dead end”. You need to hike over the tree/roots to get to the falls! It also does get a bit rocky at the top, so just be careful! "
39,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"Loved this trail! We started around 8AM and didn’t really see anyone until we started to head down. Our feet got wet, but the river crossings others mentioned are just little streams... you’ll get wet but there’s not any fear of falling into a deep river (yay!). The tree you have to climb over to get to the falls looks intimidating, but my 7 year old stepson plus myself at 33 weeks pregnant didn’t have any issues with it at all. If you’re too scared to do it, you can still see the falls - you just don’t get as close. Beautiful hike the entire time! Lots of shade! "
40,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"Heavily trafficked with amazing views the entire way! I went tot the base of the falls, the falls themselves, and explored the emerald lake hike (about another 5 miles up). Great workout with a lot of shade. I recommend going earlier. 
Be aware, on my way down I did see a snake slither into the brush so I recommend keeping the dogs on a leash. "
41,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']",
42,2019-07-20,['hiking'],Pretty easy hike for just about anyone wanting to get out and explore. Falls were pretty.
43,2019-07-19,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'rocky']","At the very end when you see the sign that says Emerald Lake one way and Scout falls the other, the scout falls trail seems to end, but if you’re willing to climb a tree and a couple granite steps, you’ll reach the falls. Kind of confusing because it just dead ends."
44,2019-07-18,['hiking'],Great hike! Lots to see and fun mini waterfalls along the way. Not too busy on a week night and was a perfect evening hike. Bring mosquito repellent! And expect your feet to get wet. Beautiful payoff at the end. 
45,2019-07-18,['hiking'],"Quite possibly one of my favorite waterfall hikes! We walked through lots of little streams crossing the trail and down the middle of the trail itself. Incredibly green and the flowers were amazing. Mosquitoes were out as well. We had little kids ages 4-9 who all did incredibly well. All in all with lots of breaks to allow other hikers to pass, and time at the waterfall, we spent 2 hours 20 minutes on the trail. Well worth the drive to Utah County!!"
46,2019-07-18,['hiking'],"Incredible, can’t believe I havnt been on this before. Very chill with intermittent shade. "
47,2019-07-18,['hiking'],One of the coolest trails with a huge pay off at the end! Def would rate this trail as moderate due to the scrambling needed towards the end to really get up close to the falls. 
48,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike and waterfalls with lush greenery along the trail. 50/50 shade/sun. Well worn trail with parking lot just above the Timpooneke campground. Although there were little kids who were on this trail with parents when I hiked it, I wouldn't rate this trail as 'easy' due to some rocky sections of trail and lots of stair-stepping up over rocks, and about 6 to 8 small stream crossings. it's a steady incline to the falls. One spot at end of trail required scrambling over a small vertical section of tree roots. Maybe more of a ""moderately easy"" rating is better. Definitely worth the hike. "
49,2019-07-14,['hiking'],This was. Beautiful hike ... a bit hot but some shade last half it seems
50,2019-07-12,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Loved this hike! Pretty views on the way up and spectacular on the way down. I had hiked this one a few years ago but didn't make it all the way to the falls, I'm so glad my first time up was this year when the falls are so full, it is absolutely beautiful! Busy traill but everyone is courteous, several stream crossings and a wet/muddy stretch when you're closer to the falls but nothing too bad, feet will get a little wet though. Some open sunny stretches but lots of shade too. Well worth the drive and time, will definitely do this one again!"
51,2019-07-12,['hiking'],"This hike is BEAUTIFUL! Everything is very lush. The trail is pretty narrow and was rather busy but I didn't mind because everyone was very considerate of other hikers. I didn't take kids with me but I would say this trail is great for kids because I passed more children than adults. There are a few small waterfalls along the trail.  You will have to cross over some water and walk on a little mud. You will go in and out of shade during this hike. I think everything about this hike was wonderful, even the drive was beautiful. The only thing that bugged me was that you can't buy a single day pass when entering the canyon. I had to buy a 3 day pass for $6. Only mildly annoying but I wouldn't let that stop you from exploring the beauty. "
52,2019-07-11,['hiking'],"Fun little trail, beautiful views of these awesome falls! Not a lot of spots to sit and eat your lunch from while gazing at the falls. Did this one 7/10/19. No snow on trail, water crossings and water running down trail in spots, so don’t be afraid to get your feet wet!!"
53,2019-07-10,"['hiking', 'muddy']","some mud, and a lot of sun, so I recommend starting early. Great for kids, though there are a few steep edges. Our almost-3 year old was able to hike this with us, though we did carry him for a few short stretches as he tired out."
54,2019-07-09,['hiking'],"Wow!! I have done this hike multiple times a year for several years, but I have never seen the falls be so full and beautiful! With all of the snow that fell, they are literally running on half of the mountainside! STUNNING and so rare! There is more water on the trailb than normal, but easily passable. Young children would need help and waterproof shoes are a good idea. 

I will definitely be hitting this trail a few more times this season! "
55,2019-07-08,['hiking'],This is a great hike for both dogs and kids. We went on a Sunday morning so it wasn’t busy at all. It was nice and shady. It’s beautiful and my son loved it for his first hike. 
56,2019-07-08,['hiking'],"Great hike!  I’d recommend seeing the falls and then hiking up to the next plateau which is only another 15 minutes and offers great views of Lone Peak and nearby ranges.  The hike was just right on length and challenge for our first hike of the season, but I would be ready for navigating a handful of shallow streams."
57,2019-07-06,['hiking'],My kids LOVED it! Their favorite part was walking through all the water. There’s some BEAUTIFUL views up there and the falls were Gorgeous. 
58,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"I would highly recommend this trail however would be very careful with small children. There are a lot of river crossings with slippery rocks and a cliff on the other side if you fall. Other than that, beautiful hike "
59,2019-07-05,['hiking'],loved this hike!!! the waterfall and the scenery is just beautiful.
60,2019-07-04,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Such a great hike! Snow is out of the way. Just a little water and mud at times. 
61,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"The falls are in rare form due to the amazing winter we had. Easy hike, spectacular views and photos just can't do it justice. Go see for yourself!!!!"
62,2019-07-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Great easy trail. Not too much snow on the trail, just watch your step. Take the switchbacks up to the falls for an incredible view."
63,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'snow']","beautiful trail and views! was a little muddy and snowy at the top but nothing crazy :) 
falls were going full force! 
we saw some deer too! "
64,2019-06-29,['hiking'],Still snow when you near the end of this trail. Falls are awesome. 
65,2019-06-28,['hiking'],"So beautiful! Avalanche totally changed the top of the trail, but tons of water and amazing views."
66,2019-06-22,['hiking'],"beautiful hike with a fantastic destination!
"
67,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",So much water!  waterfalls were everywhere it was beautiful.  Snow still blockes the last part of the trail.
68,2019-06-17,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful walk, unfortunately there was still snow so we were not able to hike all the way to the falls. We will be returning later in the summer to do the entire hike. Beautiful scenery though!"
69,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Trail was fun with lot of beautiful views . But had to come back from mid as there is still lot of snow after a mile hike . 
70,2019-06-15,['hiking'],Trail still covered in snow about a mile in where most people were turning around today
71,2018-10-29,[''],"The water fall has dried out , but it was nice and easy hike . I enjoyed it itself"
72,2018-09-24,['trail running'],This was an awesome little hike! Kid and dog friendly! Super easy! Great views! 1 hour up 1 hour down! Super shady and very easy!
73,2018-09-16,[''],Easy hike and so beautiful!
74,2018-08-24,[''],"Took my daughter yesterday and she is 4 years old. She is an experience hiker. I would not necessarily call this a kid friendly hike. I was also back packing my 10 month son and when you have to climb the branches to view the falls...it was not ideal. However, lovely hike"
75,2018-08-19,[''],"Awesome hike with low traffic even late morning on a Sunday. The trail markings are awful though! You take Timanookee trail for about a mile and a half, cross a stream, and take a left at the fork right after. Shortly after that you will start climbing rocks that get steeper towards the top and then you are there! I took a 4.5 and 6 year old with me and I don’t think I’d do that again with those rocks. The falls are very small right now. Overall nice, pretty hike!"
76,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"We took our 9 and 11 year old girls, they did just fine with a few stops for water; we hit the trail at noon in mid-August, it was dry and hot, but lots of sections of the trail had shade, which our kids liked."
77,2018-08-17,[''],Falls are only a bit more than a trickle this time of year. Steeper hike than you'd think
78,2018-08-10,[''],"great hike with great views!! made for a nice escape from the smokey valley too. there is one spot that was a bit sketchy, but our dog did it no problem. you basically climb up some trees roots hanging over the trail. the falls were so cold, so I don't recommend standing under them. ;) and the flowers were beautiful too!!! I'd definitely do this one again."
79,2018-08-05,['hiking'],Beautiful hike!  Everything was green and lush on the trail.  Lots of people coming down from seeing the sunrise on Timp but the trail wasn't too crowded.  When we got to the falls there was only one other small group there so we got some peace and quiet and cooled off next to the water.  Our little dog loved it too!  Good hike for families and people of all ages!
80,2018-08-02,['hiking'],We loved this trail! I went with my brother and 6 month baby in a carrier. We tried it once in the heat of the day and couldn’t make it with my daughter but tried again in the morning and it was perfect for all of us. Make sure you to take the right at the first fork. There is a part where you have to climb up some tree roots but it was not too bad. There were several elderly people who were hiking it just fine. In total it was about 2-2.5 hours round trip. (With lots of time enjoying the falls.)
81,2018-07-30,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery.
82,2018-07-22,['hiking'],LOVE this hike. Great for kids. Awesome views. Short. One sketchy section for little ones but no big deal if you hold their hands.
83,2018-07-21,['hiking'],"This is a fairly straightforward climb to a waterfall that is, as others have noted, pretty dry this season. The first 1.3 - 1.5 miles of the ascent are rather featureless. Once you reach the higher altitudes, you start to get some views of the canyon and Alpine and Lehi beyond. It is a pleasant trail, one of the busier ones we hiked, but probably not one we will repeat.

As to the fork at the log referred to in previews reviews: there is a sign post pointing to Scout Falls which takes you on a short (but slightly difficult climb) and, if you take the other fork, you climb above the falls and get a nice view of the area.

The great: not much other than the clear paths.

The good: some of the views are nice and it is a good workout.

The not so great or good: busy trail, much of the trail is meh, a long way to drive to the trailhead."
84,2018-07-18,['hiking'],"The trail itself is beautiful right now. Lots of shade and wildflowers. It is a steady incline the whole way to the falls, but is very manageable. The falls themselves were a bit disappointing due to the lack of snowpack from this past winter. Like others have mentioned take timpanooke trail and stay right at the fork with the log. From there it’s a few gradual switchbacks to the falls. Word of caution, getting to the actual falls requires you to do a little bit of climbing up some rocky area ensnared with tree roots and the falls themselves are on a somewhat sheer cliff face."
85,2018-07-16,['hiking'],the falls had little to no water and the trail wasn't well posted. have to be careful you don't continue on the timp trail.
86,2018-07-09,[''],"Fantastic trail. Beautiful, family-friendly while still being a bit of a challenge. Beautiful falls at the end. Can get crowded, but if you go early it's just you and the wilderness! Watch for wild life; I saw a mother moose and 2 calves with her!"
87,2018-07-08,['hiking'],Great hike. Read previous reviews to follow the 7.7 mike hike and to stay right at the log so it worked out well! Lots of shade. Great for dogs. Proved to be a good workout!
88,2018-06-25,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike and the wild flowers are starting to appear. The waterfall isn't very big, but still really pretty so bring your camera. I will say that if you have bad knees this might not be the best hike for you. Also, the trailhead isn't marked very well so it's a little confusing. Take the trail marked as Timpooneke (the one marked as 7 miles.) You'll pass a few small water falls on the way up and then you'll see a big log where the trail forks keep right at the fork and keep going up. You'll see the bigger waterfall and when you keep going up for about another half a mile it levels off to where you have a beautiful 360 degree view, very beautiful! =)"
89,2018-06-20,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike!! Gorgeous views, the flowers are popping out everywhere and very well maintained. Only sad the Falls weren’t as big due to our warm winter."
90,2018-06-18,['hiking'],Very nice trail with beautiful views! I didn't read the reviews that said to stay right at the fork (honestly don't remember a fork) to get to the top of the falls so we ended up climbing up some rock and cutting over about the middle of the falls. Will definitely try again to find the right way to go to the top!
91,2018-06-17,[''],Was a lovely evening hike with the kids. We had shade cover most of the way up that you wouldn’t have in the morning. There were a few forks in the trail that were unmarked so we followed a previous commenters directions and made it there no problem. Lots of smaller waterfalls to cross over on the way up added to the fun for the kids.
92,2018-06-15,['hiking'],"This may be easy for fit persons, but for those who are just starting to get in shape and are heavy, this is a bit of a strenuous ascent - but a great workout and well worth the views! We went on 6/10 mid afternoon - no snow and the trail wasn't crowded, we passed maybe a dozen other groups. We went up past the falls, took a right at the fork and hiked another mile to a windy clearing below Mt. Timpanogos where we spotted a female moose and a doe with 2 fawn. "
93,2018-06-14,['hiking'],Great little hike. The trail is a gradual incline all the way to the falls and easy enough for the whole family to enjoy. The scenery is beautiful and the falls are spectacular. We went on Sunday (6/03) in the afternoon-evening and the weather was perfect. The trail wasn't very crowded either. This is a perfect quick hike for anyone. Remember to stay right at the fork near the end of the trail and it will take you to the top of the falls.
94,2018-06-14,[''],"The trail to this hike is pretty narrow and crowded. This trail gets a lot of people. The scenery while hiking is quite beautiful. It’s a peaceful environment, you get a calm feeling. Getting to the waterfall is a bit tricky. It looks like the trail ends but you just have to keep going. Successfully made it to the top but there isn’t much to see, I wouldn’t recommend going any further than the second level of the waterfall."
95,2018-06-04,[''],Beautiful hike or running trail. There is no snow left on the path. I went in the evening (6/3) and didn’t have any problem with crowds. Enjoy!
96,2018-05-31,[''],"Fabulous easy hike. It took me a minute to figure it out but here's some info that helped me. When you get to the trailhead it forks into three different paths. Take the one that says Timpanooke trail. It will go up to the right a bit and you'll pass a hiker registration board and a small building. This is the trail you'll take all the way up to the falls. A while down the trail, you'll run into another fork. The left trail has a log in the middle and is closer to the sound of the falls. The right trail goes up father and leads away from the sound of the falls. Take the right trail. It will lead you to where you want to go. Taking the left trail at this fork will only take you to the bottom of the falls and it's a long hike up to the top. I ran into some great people who directed me on which way to go yesterday. S/O to those awesome women!"
97,2018-05-25,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! Perfect for kids. Go during the week to avoid crowds
98,2018-05-22,['hiking'],We parked from the gate at the alpine loop so it added about 4 miles in total (2 miles each way). Gorgeous weather and no one on the trail due to the long precursor of a walk. It’s a lovely valley to walk in.
99,2018-05-21,['hiking'],"Always one of my favorite hikes in the area.  Just went up today (5/20) path was clear and barely any snow on the trail up to the falls.  Usually around this time of year there are large patches of snow to hike over.  The falls were a bit small today, I’m hoping as the snow on the upper mountain continues to melt the falls will grow, but with the limited snow fall this year I’m not holding my breath.  Regardless of the amount of water this is always a beautiful area and one of my favorite mountains to be on in the summer."
100,2018-05-11,['hiking'],"Didn't pick the best time of year for this one, went in early March. The snow got deeper and deeper as we got closer to the falls till we were waist deep for a good quarter to half mile. It was incredibly difficult to hike in that much snow but it was beautiful and I imagine it would be a pretty easy hike if there wasn't any snow! Part of the road was closed which added a little distance but not much."
101,2017-12-27,[''],Simple and fun
102,2017-11-06,['hiking'],"The road is closed to get to the trailhead for winter, walked 1.8 miles up the road to get to the trailhead"
103,2017-10-20,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes! If you live in the Utah County area, this is a good hike to keep in mind if you're short on time."
104,2017-10-14,['hiking'],Nice little hike.  This is usually the first hike of our season and we always go beyond Scout Falls.  Easy hike unless the snow is too deep.
105,2017-10-01,['hiking'],"Super pretty and pretty easy hike. It's a little confusing when you get to the sign though. Take the left fork and follow it, you'll climb up the tree roots and then your basically there!  It's seriously beautiful "
106,2017-09-17,['hiking'],A nice steady elevation.  Gets cooler as you go up so dress with a few layers.
107,2017-09-14,[''],Scouts Falls always a great hike. You come to a fork stay right.
108,2017-09-13,['hiking'],The root wall I had to scale at the end was interesting.  Beautiful waterfall and didn't take as long as I thought to get there and back.  $6 Canyon fee
109,2017-09-12,[''],Great hike for a family - nice to have a waterfall at the end for the kids to look forward to.
110,2017-09-07,['hiking'],Relatively easy trail that is at a slight yet constant climb.  In the afternoon you can have full shade the whole way which is nice in the summer time.  The Falls vary in intensity but never disappoint.  Hardest part for me on this one is not going to the top of Timp.
111,2017-09-04,['hiking'],"Fabulous trail! Was a little worried it might be packed on the holiday weekend, but it was perfect! Beautiful views and nothing too intense. We took our time and enjoyed every minute l."
112,2017-08-27,[''],Great Trail fun for kids! Beautiful waterfalls
113,2017-08-20,['hiking'],"Did this one in the late afternoon so it was shaded the entire way. It's uphill the entire way, but a gradual incline so it never became strenuous. You cross many small runoff streams, so wear shoes that can get wet. The most difficult part is climbing some tree roots right before the falls, but even that part wasn't too difficult. Overall this was a fun, beautiful hike good for pretty much any skill level."
114,2017-08-14,['hiking'],"The view is amazing! Has some steep parts, but not too bad. There's shade later in the day, but personally I like going in the middle of the day because the sun makes everything much more green."
115,2017-08-14,['hiking'],"Easy enough my 3 year old hiked most of the way. Cool, shaded, nice views of the mountain and falls."
116,2017-08-12,['hiking'],Great hike today!
117,2017-08-11,['hiking'],Family hike with my 9 year old and 4 year old daughters. Very fun and worth seeing. Everybody loved it.
118,2017-08-05,['hiking'],I absolutely loved this trail! It was a little harder than expected but I loved it so much I did 2 days in a row!! I would definitely recommend it.
119,2017-07-28,[''],"This hike has about everything you could ask for in 4+ miles round trip! Gorgeous trail, wildflowers, amazing views, and an incredible payoff with the waterfalls. I could not recommend this hike more!"
120,2017-07-27,['hiking'],Probably my favorite hike so far this year. We hiked about a half mile past the falls and saw a bull moose with a cow and calf. It was super awesome!
121,2017-07-26,['hiking'],It's a little harder then I was expecting but so worth it.
122,2017-07-24,[''],Definitely a favorite!
123,2017-07-24,['hiking'],"I loved this hike! There were so many wildflowers and beautiful falls! It was not too long. I tried it earlier in the year and could not figure out which trail to take. Luckily, there were a forest ranger to help explain which way to go this time. So beautiful!"
124,2017-07-23,[''],It's a very easy hike until the last few hundred meters where you'll have to climb over some branches/ roots to get a good view of the three waterfalls. Expect to get your feet wet as you will be walking through quite a few patches of water. It is a gorgeous hike that must be even more amazing when more flowers are in bloom.
125,2017-07-21,['hiking'],This was the best hike ever! I did it twice in one day it was so awesome haha very easy and the end is definitely worth it!! 
126,2017-07-18,[''],"Signs would've been helpful, easy to go the wrong way and not make it to the top. But great hike!"
127,2017-07-15,[''],"great trail...the falls are beautiful! would definitely do it again. Steady climb all the way up, but not too bad and worth it! Going down was quick and easy. I read this on another review, but I'll say it again...when you come to the fork, go right, even though it looks like you are headed away from the falls. the left way will take you rock climbing!"
128,2017-07-15,['hiking'],Great hike! Still really hot so I recommend going early. Single track trail. Crosses waterfalls so wear shoes that can get wet. The Falls were amazing! Will hike this trail again.
129,2017-07-15,[''],"Such a beautiful hike. I took six kids with me ages 2(in a back pack), 5, 8, 11, and 2-13 year olds. We all loved it. The waterfall at the end was icing on the cake, it was amazing!!"
130,2017-07-13,[''],"Loved this hike! It's a good challenge for kids or beginners; fun and pleasant for experienced trekkers. The last quarter mile to the falls was my favorite!! Beautiful water, amazing view. This is a must do hike! Go early and you won't see anyone else. We were totally alone but saw tons of people on the way back. We got on the trail at 9am and left parking by 11 and it was busy. (We also saw a moose and her two babies! Didn't stop to say hi, but that was great to see!)"
131,2017-07-11,['hiking'],"Easy hike for kids. Only a couple parts that you need to be careful with the little ones. It is a beautiful hike from start to finish. There is no sign at the trail head, but you can see the fall early on in the hike to know your on the right trail."
132,2017-07-10,[''],"So far my favorite hike this summer. I love American Fork Canyon. It's so pretty up there. Reminds of of western Washington where I grew up. We did this with our 4, 10, and 12 year olds. They did awesome. Great trail. 4 year old got carried a few times, but not too much. Scout falls is really pretty and flowing like crazy this time of year. Little hint, stay right even though it looks like you will be heading down away from the falls. It wraps around and is much easier to navigate. We went straight up and it was a little sketchy with the incline and loose rock. "
133,2017-07-10,['hiking'],This was a beautiful hike.  We took our 1 and 3 year old and they loved it.  The 3 old was able to hike most of it on his own.  We only carried him a little.  I definitely recommend it.  Dog friendly but they wouldn't be able to go to the falls.
134,2017-07-10,[''],"Stunning views and a pretty tame hike. Somehow we were the only people at the falls for 20 min. Steady, moderate elevation gain. Clocked exactly 4 miles round trip on the Garmin. Will definitely do this one again."
135,2017-07-09,['hiking'],Was a beautiful hike filled with views and water. The falls being so cold at the end made for such a refreshing stop and stare at the Unitas.
136,2017-07-05,['hiking'],"Took 4 kids on the Fourth of July. Take the right turn every opportunity until you are right below the falls. We crossed runoff streams on the trail several times- cold water sloshing in our socks made the day better. We saw several butterflies and wildflowers. The kids loved standing under the falls and reaching into the water. That made me a bit nervous; but if Daddy does it, so do they. We went at a 4-year olds pace and took 90 minutes up and about 60 back."
137,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"Great hike, especially this time of year with the runoff. The wildflowers were gorgeous. My 7-year old did great until the very end, which is really rocky and steep. But you can still see great views of the falls."
138,2017-07-02,[''],"Went June 21, 2017 - took my 7 year old nephew. Great hike for kids in my opinion. Had a small patch of snow and a couple water run-offs to cross. It had beautiful views. We saw a deer on the way up."
139,2017-06-18,['hiking'],Hot! Not a lot of shade and we did it starting around noon. Wear sunblock and bring lots of water. Beautiful payoff with the falls at the end. Made it with just a little fussing from the 3 and 6 year old. Confusing to find the trailhead. Ask fellow hikers and read previous reviews.
140,2017-06-16,[''],"A must do hike, got a little rough at the end but it was well worth it."
141,2017-06-11,[''],Awesome hike for all ages. The falls are some of the prettiest I've seen in Utah. Of course we are watching a record snow fall melt off so it's a good year. It took us 40 minutes to get to the falls including some significant time messing around on the snow field 1/2 way up.
142,2017-06-08,['trail running'],
143,2017-06-05,['hiking'],Too much snow to safely hike to the falls right now. It's melting quickly though. It'll be great in a couple of weeks.
144,2017-05-30,[''],Beautiful but snow too much for us to pass with our baby
145,2017-05-29,[''],"the trail is mostly covered in snow about a mile in to the hike, with rivulets of snow melt making the trail a bit muddy between snow patches. We (and lots of others!) braved the snow to get to the first big falls, but without better equipment and preparation Scout Falls was out of reach. Guess we'll have to try again at the end of June!"
146,2016-09-14,[''],Beautiful trail. So glad I read the reviews before or I wouldn't have known where the trailhead was. Just stick to the Timp trail and pass the ranger box. The trail was easy for my little ones but the difficulty came in the last bit to actually see the falls but they bravely climbed the rocks and got their view of the waterfall.
147,2016-09-12,['hiking'],"This hike is easy and it is not 9.5 miles as it's stated in the decription, it's about 4 miles roundtrip. The falls are very small but beautiful. There are no signs that states where the trail begins but it is the same trail that takes you to Emerald Lake and Mount Timpanogos Summit. The views are very nice and the hike is friendly enough for kids."
148,2016-08-27,[''],"I liked this hike - beautiful views, tree coverage and well maintained.  The trail is not marked - so reading the reviews was very helpful.  Right before the falls was a series of steep loose rocks which were a bit unsafe."
149,2016-08-21,['hiking'],"This hike is GORGEOUS! My husband and I took our daughter (8) and it was the perfect length for her. It was also easy. Make sure to read through all reviews before heading out; there is some great advice that saved us time and difficulty! My main suggestion is to head to the RIGHT when the trail forks. It will take you right up to the falls, no scrambling required! The leaves are beginning to change, so get up there soon!"
150,2016-08-08,[''],"Love this hike !!! Nice shade, pretty easy, lots of fun creeks to go through, and a nice beautiful waterfall at the top!"
151,2016-08-03,[''],Easy but beautiful hike. Fun to do with the kids.
152,2016-07-29,['hiking'],"Great, short hike. As other reviews have said- this is not 9 miles. It's about 4 miles to get to the falls and back. The falls are small but the surrounds are very pretty all the way up."
153,2016-07-25,['hiking'],"It was a great easy trail for kids.  Just don't miss the left turn to the falls, the sign that we had remembered from previous years wasn't there anymore."
154,2016-07-12,['hiking'],Loved this hike!  Took 11 kids ranging from 6mo-16 years and it was a blast. The scenery was incredible the falls were worth it. We did have some trouble getting the littlest ones up that last climb to the falls but had many helping hands from the older kids and we made it work. Can't wait to do this one in the fall!
155,2016-07-08,['hiking'],"This hike was great! Took a bit longer with 3 littles, but the waterfall was pretty and there are lots of wildflowers most of the way. Make sure to not cross the tree (toward the top) and to just turn right when you get to the fork, the path is much easier that way :)"
156,2016-07-08,[''],small trail but beautiful!
157,2016-07-08,['hiking'],Amazing
158,2016-07-08,['hiking'],"I absolutely loved this beautiful trail - gorgeous scenery and vegetation, including about a dozen varieties of wildflowers. We hiked in the evening at the end of June and the trail was almost entirely in the shade and the temperature was perfect. The views are amazing throughout. We loved that the switchback part of the trail crossed over several little waterfalls and creeks. The falls themselves were lovely, but the hike to get there was my favorite part."
159,2016-07-07,['hiking'],Loved the hike!  My 4 year old had no problem with it.
160,2016-07-02,[''],"This was a great hike. Starts at the Guard shack on the right from the trail head. 1.4 miles in, 1.4 miles out. Gorgeous views. Great for kids (mine is 8 yrs. and he loved it) Gradual climb, and fun to run back down! There is some sunny and some shady areas of the trail, so even midday hiking was nice. Towards the top there are some lovely little falls to cool you off along the trail, then a steeper rock scrambled the last 50 yards leads to 2 larger falls."
161,2016-06-25,[''],"An awesome family hike (we have kids ages 1-8) about 4 miles long. Really easy until the very end where you have to climb some really steep areas to get to the actual falls. Lots of wildflowers and butterflies. Our kids all want to go again soon. Take the sunscreen- there are some places on the trail where you don't get shade for quite a while, but lots of it is shaded."
162,2016-06-20,[''],"A short and easy hike and perfect for younger children (age 7+). It's a gradual incline so not too strenuous. Well maintained with stunning views all along the way. It's a bit confusing when you arrive at the parking lot because it is the head for several trails, but none marked ""Scout Falls"". Go to the trail on the right and start at the little ranger hut and head up. It's just short of 3 mi. round trip. There are a lot of trees and vegetation lining the trail, but by mid morning and afternoon, the sun is straight down on you and shade is sparse. When you get to the falls, it's a bit tricky because the trail ends at a very steep and extremely rocky hillside. You need to scale up the rocks for about 100 yards until you get to the base of just 1 of the falls, then need to hike through the water and up a muddy hill to reach the 2nd falls. If you have young children, this may be difficult to do and the falls might just be something you view from a distance. We found the spray from the falls to be very refreshing on a hot summer's day and really enjoyed it! Once you are at the falls, the view down the canyon is spectacular!"
163,2016-06-20,['hiking'],Fist off. This is nowhere near 9 miles. It's about 2.25 miles to the falls and it's gorgeous. Very nice hike and well worth your time if you're in the area
164,2016-06-10,['hiking'],"This is an absolutely beautiful hike. We were in awe the whole time we hiked and stopped frequently for pictures. The falls were beautiful and impressive. There were several smaller falls as well, which were also great. It's a good hike for beginners, but isn't too easy that it's not fun. The hike constantly over looks a beautiful valley. So glad we did this one!"
165,2016-05-30,[''],"Still some snow up there so couldn't get as close to the falls as we would like, but still beautiful.  Walking stick would be good over the snow."
166,2016-01-11,[''],Beautiful in the spring with purple blooms growing on the wet rock walls near the falls.
167,2015-09-07,['hiking'],This is definitely a hike for those who are just getting into hiking. It is great for families and for a quick trip in and out. The falls were not in full force because it is late summer but they were still a satisfying finish to the hike. The best part of the hike was the constant view of a beautiful canyon. We couldn't stop taking pictures. The waterfall was also a great spot for taking pictures. All in all it was a very scenic and beautiful hike that the whole family can enjoy.
168,2015-08-25,['hiking'],"The runoff later in the season is scarce, but still makes for two small waterfalls. Not too hard to find. Only thing I would recommend is don’t park on the road! Park in the parking lot, or if you go down the road either ways there are campgrounds where you can park. As we were leaving we saw just about everyone on the road get ticketed and some cars were getting towed because they didn’t have all four tired off the road. 
Awesome hike altogether though. It’s dog friendly and fun for the kiddos. Spent about 1 ½ hours doing the whole thing and got back before noon. It’s a good morning hike to do before it gets too hot in the afternoon."
169,2015-08-22,['hiking'],"Super easy, if you climb up to the water fall you can capture good photos."
170,2015-08-16,[''],only downside would be shortage of parking and the many other people that are there on weekends. go on weekdays to avoid crowds
171,2015-08-12,[''],Pretty good hike. Make sure you go earlier in the summer so the falls are bigger.
172,2015-08-11,[''],Great hike. Perfect for a quick family hike. I would do it again any day.
173,2015-08-09,['hiking'],"Really awesome hike, gets a bit muddy towards the top but the view is amazing all the way up!"
174,2015-07-28,[''],"Pretty nice hike. Good scenery going up and the little waterfall is pretty. I can see why some people report the end to be slippery and dangerous. I think it all depends on the timing of when u go. There was some slightly muddy rocky areas, but the muddy spots were short and not that bad. At another time, they may have been quite a bit worse, I imagine if there had been recent rain. 
One thing that I didn't care for with this hike is that it's the same trailhead as Timpanogos, so you basically don't feel like the hike is done as it keeps going and it's possible I didn't even complete it as there may have been a bigger fall further up. But at the base of the trail, it tells you that it's a 1.4 mile hike up, I stopped at almost 2 miles, but didn't feel like I really reached Scout Falls (it wasn't like in the pictures I've seen). That may be even further up. Took about an hour up and 35 min back down."
175,2015-07-26,['hiking'],"Scout Falls was probably the perfect family hike. 3 miles round trip, with an elevation gain of almost 900 feet. Really gentle incline, shaded most of the way. A few stream crossings, gorgeous views, and a waterfall at the end. It took us 2 hours, but it could easily be done in less. There is a spot at the end where you have to climb up through roots, but we didn't find that hard to navigate with kids (youngest 7, plus a baby in a pack) although the ledge afterwards on the way to the falls (and the area around the bottom of the falls) was a little slippery and steep and I had to keep my youngest close. Also, we went in early evening and my kids were a little cold by the time we got to the falls, so layers might be a good idea even in the summer.  When we went (end of July) the falls were not as strong as I imagine they would be earlier in the year, but the view from the falls was breathtaking. Definitely recommend."
176,2015-07-20,['hiking'],"It was OK. We had a lot of kids ranging from 2-7. Base of falls was sketchy and steep, not really a place for kids to play. I was thinking it would flatten a little (or even pool) at the base of falls, but it doesn't. I should have looked more closely at previous pics. It was very pretty and not very difficult, but it still took us about 3 1/2 hours."
177,2015-07-19,['hiking'],This was a fun little hike. Great views and not busy at all on a Thursday evening in July. I would recommend it for anyone starting to get into hiking to more experienced hikers looking for a shorter hike.
178,2015-07-15,['hiking'],"This was an amazing hike! Great for kids, dogs and adults! Beautiful view! Would highly recommend this trail!"
179,2015-07-13,[''],Beautiful hike!!!!  Loved it and it was so easy for my little ones. There are three trails take the trail that passes the ranger station.
180,2015-07-13,['hiking'],Such a beautiful hike with great views! I highly recommend it!
181,2015-07-06,['hiking'],Excellent evening hike! Especially in the hot summer. The trail hugs the eastern slope of the valley and has a lot of tree coverage. Good for any skill level. Our three year old hiked the whole thing without any complaints. An added bonus is that there are several small mountain streams that cross the trail in the spring and early summer months. The kids thought that was super fun. Scout Falls is beautiful and refreshing to stand near. Definitely want to do this hike again!
182,2015-06-27,[''],I'm 30 weeks pregnant and was able to do this hike! It's so beautiful and super fun. Preggo friendly too!
183,2015-06-12,[''],super easy. great views. pretty quick hike. loved it!!
184,2015-06-09,['hiking'],"Loved this hike.  Beautiful and constantly changing scenery all the way to the top.  Take the fork in the trail to the right when you come to it.  Your mind will say go left...if you don't mind scrambling straight up the waterfall kicking rocks on those behind you this is your path....Going right is a smooth trail that requires navigating a very simple section of tree roots.  If you can climb up 3 rungs of a ladder, you can get over the roots."
185,2015-06-06,[''],"I went on this hike today (6/5/14) with my two 5 year olds and we all had a good time. The trail is beautiful and the falls are even better. If you've never hiked this trail before, at the beginning make sure to take the middle path that goes past the ranger station and then when you come to the fork, take the right. That will get you right up close to the falls. Great hike."
186,2015-06-01,[''],Pretty hike with some fun rock hops. Beautiful view of meadow below as you ascend the trail. Falls are impressive up close. Valley view between the two mountains at the falls was stunning.
187,2015-05-26,['hiking'],Nice gentle hike with beautiful vistas.  A lot of people but it was Memorial Day so not unexpected.
188,2014-10-26,['hiking'],"The falls at the end was a great reward for this hike. Its a pretty easy, flat trail that heads up to the falls. A great trail to bring the dog along with. Trailhead is clearly marked and plenty of parking. Trail is easy to follow and well maintained. I did this hike in May, which was a little early as there was still plenty of snow on the trail as we neared the end, and our group was actually forced to stop short because there was too much snow to continue. We were able to still see the falls though. I wouldn't recommend doing this hike earlier than June."
189,2014-10-13,['hiking'],Incredible
190,2014-09-13,[''],Great short hike. Good if you want to do some of mt. Timp but not the whole hike. There are no signs for hike until the turnoff. So just follow timpanooke trail till you hit the one sign there is.
191,2014-08-30,['hiking'],"Super easy! It was fun and simple, the only part that was ""difficult"" was climbing up tree roots for 8 feet just before you hit the falls. Our 5 month old puppy had a blast too."
192,2014-08-14,['hiking'],"First hike out with my husband, so we decided to try something simple.  This trail is fairly simple with plenty of views for meadows and aspen trees and flowers.  I noticed several butterflies while we walked along the trail.  There are several mini-waterfalls/creeks that you will pass on the trail, so I found that my water-proof boots were put to good use
.
Once you actually reach where the waterfall is, you have to climb up some tree roots and dirt about 8 feet tall to actually get to the waterfall area, which is hidden behind said trees.  The waterfall area made me somewhat nervous because it wasn't as wide as I would have wanted the walking area to be and it was literally on the edge of a cliff.  We got some pictures though which were nice.  Overall fun first hike."
193,2014-08-11,[''],"I read online this was a kid friendly hike. After doing this last night I can confirm it is NOT. We took my 6 year old who did great & our 2 year old. The hike was longer then I expected but for the most part pretty easy. We got all the way t the ""Scout Falls"" sign & had to turn around. The part tithe actual falls was so steep & so dangerous I don't understand how any child could climb over that with out lots of assistance. It was wet & slippery & too dangerous for us to do with carting both the kids so we left. The hike total round trip took us 3 hours with the inpatient kids.  I think this would be better suited for older youth. Not for younger kids!!!"
194,2014-06-27,['hiking'],Good 1-2 hour hike. Nothing too difficult. Wouldn't recommend hiking up into the falls if you bring a dog because it's difficult to get them back down through all the loose rock.
195,2014-06-11,['hiking'],"Lovely hike.  In another two weeks, the lupines will be amazing.  The falls were beautiful."
196,2014-06-09,['hiking'],"I was trying to get in a short two-hour hike and this hike was the perfect fit.  This was my first time taking this hike and I'm glad I did.  From the parking lot, take trail #53 (by the small ranger station) since there's a few different directions to go. Once you're on the trail, you'll start out in an aspen forest that will connect to an open  mountain meadow with a meandering stream.  In the distance, you can see and hear Scout Falls roaring.  The trail will hug the meadow most of the time through the hike.  Timewise, you'll get there in under an hour at a steady pace.

Once you arrive, there's a couple ways to access the falls.  With a little extra climbing, there's off-shoot trails that take you right over to the base.  If you continue 10 minutes past the falls, you'll be treated with an alpine meadow replete with wild flowers and an overlook of the canyon.  A great bonus!!!"
197,2014-06-08,['hiking'],"This trail is absolutely beautiful!  All along the way there are vistas of meadows or small waterfalls right along the trail.  Then, when you get close to Scout Falls you can see it off in the distance and it's breathtaking.  Before you actually get to the falls there is a little trail you can take to see it a little better but don't stop there because if go back and continue on to the actual sign that tells you you're there and hike back in to the falls you can see it SO much better!  Don't miss this hike!"
198,2013-09-15,['hiking'],"I actually did not expect to come by Scout Falls, but it was about 3am and we took a turn over to it.  After scoutting around and looking at the trail on the GPS we could see that we needed to back track to get back on our path.  It didn't look like it was running very hard.  I look forward to coming back when I can just take a shorter hike to get some pictures of the falls."
199,2013-07-18,['hiking'],Very nice hike to the falls today. Nice gradual climb. 3.5 miles out and back per my tracker. Not a lot of water coming over the falls this time off year but still a nice hike. It was very hot today. There was a fair amount of shade here and there. Roughly 2 hrs to complete this hike.
200,2013-06-13,['hiking'],Great hike.  did it with our 9 month old and 2 dogs.  its a steady climb but not hard.  Also it the pictures posted by the previous person were pics of the stewart falls hike so the ones i just uploaded are of the correct water fall.  :) enjoy!
201,2012-08-01,['hiking'],Still quite a bit of snow on upper trail in late May. Also some very squishy muddy sections. Dog friendly.
202,2011-07-13,['hiking'],Really beautiful hike. Do it in early summer otherwise the falls and creek might be dried up.  Awesome place for large variety of wild flowers. Dog friendly.  I wouldn't call it easy though. It's moderate with easy parts. 
203,2011-05-22,['hiking'],"Nice, fun, short hike. Great views. Good for kids too."
