1,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail. Lots of Aspens and Meadows. As for wildflowers, we saw plenty of Aster and other flowers too. I love the stream that runs around the trail. Lovely!
We hiked about 45 minutes up just past the big meadow and then turned back. Our kids ages 6 and 7 did really well and seemed to enjoy themselves."
2,2019-07-23,['hiking'],Loved the hike beautiful trails with a creek that you can play in! 
3,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"This would be a great trail to hike, I do not recommend trying to run it. Your calves will scream bloody murder. Other than that you can see all sorts of wildlife! We saw a snake and a lot of bunnies!"
4,2019-07-13,"['backpacking', 'bugs']",Great little trail. Has good camping spots and very easy. Well maintained trail. Went this last weekend with the family. As many has said it doesn’t end with a bang but the scenery along the way makes it worth it. The only problem is the people on bikes. They have no trail etiquette and will not yield to uphill or hikers both of which should be known. They don’t realize how rude it is when they act like that.
5,2019-07-03,['hiking'],Great trail for kids. It's a gradual uphill climb the whole way but doable for my kids aged 11-4. Only partly shaded so wear sunscreen.
6,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Fun and easy hike 
7,2019-06-16,[''],"Great hike, lots of fun streams to cross with a nice meadow area! "
8,2019-06-05,[''],"Great trail, with a lot of shade and water. Will definitely come again"
9,2019-05-31,['hiking'],No grande finale (or even marker for that matter) at the end. But a fun hike with lots too see. Easy hike with little kids - I wouldn’t even go that far since the last part is dry/ugly and steeper than the beginning. 
10,2019-05-28,['hiking'],"Very gradual incline, great hike for families. A few of the bridges crossing the stream had planks missing, or nails exposed, so be sure to watch your little ones."
11,2019-05-19,['hiking'],Family friendly trail. Some pretty streams on the way up... once at the top there are some fun bridges over the streams.
12,2019-04-07,['hiking'],Would definitely recommend snowshoes
13,2019-04-05,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. Still plenty of snow. Snowshoes needed so as not to sink in. Parking lot completely clear.
14,2019-01-18,['mountain biking'],This is my favorite trail to mountain bike on. There’s so many good views and the river along the trail is beautiful. Good place to go if you just need to get away from the city. Doesn’t take very long either. I went hiking there last week and it was just as beautiful with all the snow and the sound of the creek.
15,2019-01-15,[''],"One of the best snowshoe hikes in Provo Canyon. There was a ton of snow today. I wore my spikes, but wished I had snowshoes. I usually do this as a loop, turning left at the Big Springs sign, heading through a couple of meadows. I often see turkey up here."
16,2018-11-14,[''],Nice walking trail. Nice and easy. Looked beautiful with all the fall colors
17,2018-10-09,[''],"Lovely trail to see the fall colors, and the hike is easy/fairly flat with good tree cover and a stream and is dog friendly and wasn’t crowded at all."
18,2018-09-23,['hiking'],"This time of year it’s perfect up there. This is just one of many local trails that’s great for an hour or two on a fall afternoon. The streams wind all over the valley and cross cut each other so every now and then you’ll cross over another little bridge. Also there’s dozens of places to hang a hammock or camp for the night, not sure if that’s permitted here though. I’ll update."
19,2018-09-10,['hiking'],Beautiful!
20,2018-08-28,['hiking'],"Beautiful, lots of river crossings and gradual incline!"
21,2018-07-30,['hiking'],Awesome hike. Had a great time. Pretty easy to hike.
22,2018-07-28,['hiking'],"Great family hike, even when it is hot.

many butterflies and photogenic areas.

grove like places along the trail to sit or even camp.

blatant sign before the hike starting no open fires allowed in the areas.

the springs have been capped for some time, but the caps make good tables.

other trails accessible from here."
23,2018-07-19,[''],Hike this often with my 3 year old — It’s our favorite! Nice for a leisure hike with our dogs and plenty of places of hang a hammock and relax in nature.
24,2018-07-15,['hiking'],Spring looks like it's been capped and goes through a pipe. During higher runoff water could come out an overflow pipe. Good trail
25,2018-07-09,[''],"Fun and easy hike for the whole family. Plenty of nice shady spots by the stream to stop and rest, play or picnic."
26,2018-06-21,['hiking'],I went on a Wednesday afternoon & was clearing cobwebs! Lots of butterflies & it runs right along the stream. I did encounter a few deer flys further along the trail.
27,2018-06-17,[''],"Beautiful, slightly busy. packed out a few bits of trash."
28,2018-06-12,[''],"So pretty, and hundreds of butterflies! The springs is dried up, but it was still a very fun place."
29,2018-06-02,[''],"Beautiful trail! Unfortunately...no springs. Provo City capped off the springs. Still beautiful, green, lovely nature to enjoy!"
30,2018-05-26,['hiking'],"It's a beautiful time of year to hike this trail. The landscape is vibrantly green. Butterflies are out and about. Flowers are starting to bloom. A drawback: the springs are no longer flowing as they've been capped off. But, there are still a few small creeks running throughout the hike."
31,2018-05-10,['hiking'],It was a great time. My kids and I enjoyed it!
32,2018-05-09,['mountain biking'],"Cool scenery, plenty of area to bike and not interfere with hikers. Awesome area."
33,2018-05-01,['hiking'],"Great Hike, Saw some Turkeys up at the spring."
34,2018-04-24,[''],Definitely recommend early in the morning because it gets hot and there’s not a ton of shade but it’s a beautiful easy hike
35,2018-03-31,['hiking'],"The trail isn't marked very well so we ended up going a mile or two more up the mountain, but even in July and August, it's gorgeous up there. We went on a morning just after it had rained and the whole mountain felt like the Columbia river gorge in Oregon. Everything was so green and humid and cool. It's our favorite ""get us out of the house"" trail. The last time we went was in August last summer. We have moved to SLC since and still plan to head down whenever we get a chance. 

Watch out for mountain bikers for the first half hour to hour and then you shouldn't see many more."
36,2018-02-11,[''],The butterflies in the summer are unbelievable. My daughters like us to take a picnic and rest by the beautiful little stream. One of my favorite family-friendly hikes!
37,2018-01-06,[''],This is a pretty hike any time of year. Right now it's quite snowy/icy use some spikes
38,2017-11-03,[''],"Not difficult at all, gorgeous in the fall!"
39,2017-10-05,['hiking'],Super pretty right now with autumn colors! 
40,2017-08-29,['hiking'],"This trail appears to be only marked at trail head which is at the END of the park road.  Large parking lot.  Trail is loose gravel and was very dusty the day we were on it.  It is about 70% sun and mountain meadows but enough shade to cool you down.  Trail was not marked beyond entrance but pretty obvious where the main trail is but there are many offshoot narrow footpaths going left and right.  It is an slow uphill hike and after 45 minutes we turned around.  Trail follows a beautiful stream uphill.  I can see a maintenance road you could take back to the parking lot.  No cell service (Verizon anyway so could not use app)

We did see a large gaggle of wild turkeys but other than sound of stream it's quiet.  This was a Monday afternoon and only saw one runner & 2 campers the whole 1.5 hours we where there."
41,2017-08-14,['hiking'],Beautiful and easy hike! Definitely recommend for anyone!
42,2017-08-13,[''],"Really enjoyed this trail. We didn't go all the way up cause we started too late and it was getting dark, but it was easy for my kids, pretty aspen trees, wild flowers, a creek, and even wild raspberries that we ate. I will definitely go back to go all the way to the end of the trail."
43,2017-07-30,[''],We kept going up and up!  It was a beautiful hike
44,2017-07-18,[''],
45,2017-07-09,[''],"Loved it. Both beautiful and peaceful. Not too many people. Lots of tree cover, lots of water for when you get over heated. I almost jumped in a few times "
46,2017-07-02,['hiking'],Easy hike 2 miles up the trail from the parking lot to where the springs are capped. :(  Water levels not as strong as other areas within the Wasatch but still flowing.  Flowers probably past their peak but a fair amount still present.  LOTS of meadows around with some great views.  And butterflies galore.
47,2017-06-24,[''],Very easy hike.  My kids loved all the water along the trail and the butterflies.
48,2017-06-24,['hiking'],
49,2017-06-19,[''],"One of my favorite hikes to do with my toddler! Lots of fun little bridges, ""Hobbit bridge"" and ""Fairy falls"" are the kid's favorites. Super easy for all fitness levels. Come hike with us, HikeitBaby.com"
50,2017-06-18,[''],"this hike is pretty easy, and beautiful. I enjoyed it so much! careful of mosquitoes, though."
51,2017-05-14,['hiking'],The trail was pretty as were the views of the snow capped mountains but the Springs themselves were very disappointing. 8yo made it up and back with minimal whining.
52,2016-10-28,['walking'],Great little kid friendly trail. Took my 5 year old son and 6 year old niece today. They were disappointed we didn't see any deer or moose or snakes or bobcats 
53,2016-10-10,['hiking'],This was a beautiful trail to hike.  Very kid friendly ❤️
54,2016-10-03,[''],"this trail used to be beautiful.

unfortunately, Provo capped the spring and the whole area is completely wrecked now."
55,2016-09-18,['hiking'],The hike was beautiful. We took our one year old up with us and he loved it. We did carry him most of the way. The big spring was a little disappointing due to all the pipes they're putting in. I would probably go back because it's a fun family activity and the way up is very pretty.
56,2016-08-29,[''],Could not find the spring after 1.5 m walking. Easy walk
57,2016-08-01,[''],There are a lot of trees along the trail that makes the trail very pleasant. Easy hike even for my 5 years old daughter.
58,2016-07-31,['hiking'],We couldn't find the springs. But it was a fun hike
59,2016-07-30,[''],more like small springs!! it's just a tiny steam of water coming out of a rock 
60,2016-07-25,[''],pretty hike!
61,2016-07-18,['hiking'],"This was a moderately hard hike for us, but we're very out of shape. The part that was difficult was that we didn't know where to end. There isn't much to look at when you reach the springs. I kept on going for awhile before I realized I had gone too far."
62,2016-06-18,[''],Love this trail for my horses.
63,2016-05-31,['hiking'],Loved this Trail. Beautiful scenery.
64,2016-05-31,['mountain biking'],"Two years ago, this was a wonderful trail. The Boy Scouts decided to build a Boy Scout camp up there and carved a road right up the canyon and through to the spring. I loved this trail, but the road and camp have ruined it. I still give it a few stars because once you get past the camp it is beautiful again."
65,2016-04-09,['hiking'],Easy trail with a pretty view along a creek.
66,2016-03-29,['snowshoeing'],Great time! Gets a lot of foot traffic so snowshoes aren't really necessary.
67,2016-01-20,['snowshoeing'],Good on snowshoes
68,2016-01-13,['hiking'],"Just past vivian park. Its covered in snow at the moment, but pretty flat for the most part so don't need winter hiking boots. It was beautiful."
69,2015-09-23,[''],"Awesome, beautiful hike. This hike would have been even better if it wasn't for the construction destruction happening to big spring itself. Not sure why they're doing it, but it destroyed the natural beauty."
70,2015-07-13,[''],Great easy trail for kids of all ages. Amazing mountain views.
71,2015-07-05,['mountain biking'],"Great beginner loop for mountain biking. The trail is shared by hikers so you have to be careful, but the grass provides a safe landing if you fall and its not technically difficult. Super fun!"
72,2015-07-02,['hiking'],"Good shorter hike. Saw quite a few mountain bikers around. The trail has a lot of shade on it. Quite a few birds, butterflies are out right now, mountain flowers as well. Family friendly trail. 

Notes about the hike itself: The first 2 miles are steady slight incline. The last .5 mile was slightly steeper but not too bad. I got slightly off trail for a while so note to hikers: when you come to a sign that says .2 miles to Big Spring- there are two distinct trails to the right in that direction. Go to the right 20 feet and you'll see both of them. One is much bigger- straight to the right, the other is distinct and looks very narrow. The narrow one that starts going down is the one you want to take. You'll start hearing water pretty quickly too. The bigger one ends with a connection to the Cascade trail, which is hikable, but looked more like horse trail to me. 

Enjoyable hike, recommend to all!"
73,2015-06-27,[''],This is one of my favorite trails. It's a good trail run and mountain bike trail. After you go through the meadow it gets a woodsy feel with some shade. Also good for families to hike.
74,2015-06-27,['road biking'],"Great trail followed another biker to the left of the hiking trail, the climb was forever brutal but well worth it"
75,2015-06-21,['hiking'],"This was a beautiful, woodsy trail. When we went during the first week of June, the springs were dry, so that was a disappointment, as our kids were really looking forward to seeing them."
76,2015-06-07,[''],I actually started at Rock Canyon and then climbed up to the saddle of the bull and then headed down from there. Heading down it was very snowy and I lost track of the trail for a while and just slid down the drainage ditches. But once I found the trail it was pretty easy going down. Overall a good hike. It's about 8 miles to the saddle although I wouldn't recommend going up from Big Springs.
77,2015-06-06,[''],"Great trail, very scenic, the springs were dry though so that kind of detracted from the experience. Also, the hike seemed a lot shorter than 5 miles."
78,2015-05-31,['hiking'],"Fun little hike if you are going to the springs, serious hike if you want to go to the saddle.   Very worthwhile."
79,2014-10-26,['mountain biking'],"Great biking trail. Steady and challenging climb uphill, and smooth ride downhill. A must do for mountain bikers."
80,2014-09-05,[''],Nice woodsy trail
81,2014-08-07,[''],"This trail was amazing!  So good if you have little ones. We saw two moose on our way up. We honestly can't wait to take the rest of the family on this hike.  Great views, wildlife and super easy hiking for kids. Looking forward to snowshoeing it in the winter!"
82,2014-06-23,['trail running'],"This trail is pretty nice for trail running! Not too steep for the majority of the trail, until you pass the springs and start following the trail up to Cascade Mountain. It's shaded for the majority of it, with the trail rocky half of the time and well-packed dirt the other half. I would definitely do it again, trail running or hiking."
83,2014-05-05,['hiking'],"I moved to Lehi in January, 2014, and this was my first hike; it was great. Went about 4.3 miles out from the trailhead where we parked, made it to a bit over 9000ft. Great time, I can't wait for my next adventure! Was looking forward to seeing the springs but they were dry but the views more than made up for it."
84,2013-12-23,['snowshoeing'],"Snowshoe hike, trail was well packed and probably ok with good boots.  Some had been skiing as well.  Beautiful hike, easy to follow trails, not many people.   Moderate elevation gain, more obvious returning than going up.  Went as far as the springs and back.  Road and parking plowed and maintained, easy to find.  Will go back!"
85,2013-09-02,['hiking'],"I hiked in from the Equestrian Parking area located up the road from Big Springs Park. I enjoyed this trail more than the Big Springs Hollow trail that begins from the park. The trails meet up near the springs, making a loop trail if you desire. The springs were fairly dry this late in the summer but the hike was still beautiful. I also ran into a big bull moose lying in the grass just off the trail about a mile or so above Big Springs which was quite a surprise!"
86,2013-07-13,['hiking'],My family LOVES this trail. So easy for our 3-year-old son even with our baby on our backs. We snowshoe and hike this trail. Year round fun. Shady about 60% of the time on the main path.
87,2013-07-06,['hiking'],Nice tree cover on a good portion of the trail in summer. Beautiful in winter. I've both hiked and snowshoed this trail. Kids 11 and autistic 13 year-old both snowshoe and hike this with me.
