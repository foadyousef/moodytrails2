0,2019-09-07,"['hiking', 'muddy']",I did this hike during a late afternoon and it was fantastic. Shaded all the way to the top with an excellent view. You’ll also see some wild flowers and great forestry. There are mountain bikers on the trail throughout the day. Highly recommend!
1,2019-08-26,['mountain biking'],Very beautiful and enjoyable mountain bike ride or hike!  Love it!
2,2019-08-10,['hiking'],just a little 2 mile hike. for the afternoon. maples campground wish I had a trash bag.
3,2019-07-28,['hiking'],My wife and I love this trail. Here is a summer hike overview: https://www.relive.cc/view/u3694316725  
4,2019-07-06,['hiking'],loved this trail.  Beautiful view at Ogden Lookout viewpoint.  Rattlesnakes near trail.....be careful.  
5,2019-06-25,['hiking'],"Breath taking views all the way to the view point!! Pond, creek, trees and sweeping landscapes views! This hike is a must for anyone! "
6,2019-06-03,['hiking'],"Great hike. If you plan to take your dogs, go early. Mountain bikes are very active on the trail after 0900."
7,2019-06-03,['hiking'],This was an enjoyable hike with the dogs. The view at the end is amazing. Mountain bikers also use this trail too.
8,2019-05-31,['hiking'],Pretty easy hike for anyone! We took our 8 pound Yorkie and she had no problems.. if she can do it anyone can! The flowers are all budded but haven’t quite bloomed yet but you can tell when they do it is going to be BEAUTIFUL. Planning on going back in 2 weeks to see them all blossomed! Took us 2.5 hours with a 30 minute stop at the top 
9,2019-05-13,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! It was snowy and wet towards the top, but it was as beautiful as always!"
10,2019-05-10,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Great hike. Fairly easy with awesome views. Didn’t see anyone else on the trail & it was perfect for the dogs!
11,2019-03-08,"['snowshoeing', 'snow']","Kids wanted to give snowshoeing a shot and I couldn't think of a better place than this trail.  It was not a disappointment, we enjoyed fresh snow and great surroundings."
12,2019-02-01,"['hiking', 'snow']","I hiked the Ogden Canyon Overlook Trail on February 1, 2019. (My intent was to also hike the entire Sardine Trail Loop, but beyond the trail intersection to the Ogden Canyon Overlook, snowshoes were needed.) 

Access to the trail is from the Maples Parking Lot, just west of Snowbasin Resort Lodge and their main parking lot. The trail begins at a gate at the northwest corner of the Maples parking lot. As you drop down a slight incline from Snowbasin’s main parking lot, you enter the Maples Parking area at the southeast corner, so the trail access is at the farthest corner of the parking area. (You will normally see a lot of folks parallel parking at the edge of the parking area nearest the gate where the trails begin.) 

Just beyond the gate is an interpretive station with a large map that you can view. PLEASE NOTE: if you are new to the area, I would suggest that you download a GPS map for your phone. There are a number of unofficial trail intersections that are unsigned, once you begin the gradual climb to the overlook.

The first section of the trail is actually called “Maples Road” and it is groomed during the winter. I hiked alone and on a Friday and once I hiked beyond the groomed trail/road, I only saw one other person the entire day, and that was someone on a fat tire bike. I began my hike at 11am and reached the overlook in just under two hours. My pace was not fast, and I stopped to enjoy the scenery and solitude on numerous occasions. I also followed the wrong trail for about ten minutes at an unmarked intersection, but my GPS quickly showed me that I had taken the wrong fork, and I backtracked. 

I made the hike in winter hiking boots. I had snow crampons in my backpack, but never needed them, as the traction on my boots was sufficient. Once you leave the groomed road, you might prefer snowshoes. (I will take mine next time!) The trail is narrow and the packed snow is only in the center-most few inches of the trail. If you are looking at the scenery and make a slight misstep (without snowshoes) you are likely to sink from eight inches to two feet down into the snow. 

There is a signed trail intersection around the two-mile mark (once you reach an elevation of 6888), where the left fork goes to the overlook and the right fork makes the Sardine Peak loop. Taking the left fork, a short distance beyond this trail intersection, the trail navigates some very pretty evergreen forest before reaching the overlook. The view from the overlook is very nice. 

For my hike, I wanted to complete the Sardine Loop, so I backtracked and took the Sardine Trail to Sardine Peak. While I survived this without snowshoes, it was very difficult. Beyond Sardine Peak I was unable to complete the loop, as it did not appear that anyone else had done so (there were no tracks and no packed snow for me to follow.) So, I made my way back to the intersection and followed the trail back to the parking lot. 

My circuit time was exactly five hours. 

One thing that I will share is that the solitude on this hike is occasionally interrupted by the sounds of fighter jets flying over from the Air Force Base. And also the occasional sound of a truck in the distance using “jake breaks.”"
13,2019-01-19,['skiing'],"So many reviews of hiking but my favorite way to do this trail is on touring cross country skis or a fat bike.It takes a while to do all the switchbacks and traverses but the view is wonderful in the winter time. It is a two bottle trip at a minimum. Sometimes the Powerline trail, which it transects has enough bonus powder down that I can free heel ski with magnum BC bindings. If it is to rough I simply backtrack down."
14,2018-10-08,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail with fall colors this time of year. The trail is dirt packed and slightly damp from the cool weather with lots of fall color leaves on the ground. Getting to the overlook is fun with some pretty easy switchbacks, but be sure to keep hiking till you get to the wooden bench and don’t stop early despite the trail map. The views from the overlook are gorgeous with a great mountain view and city scape. The dogs and I had a great hike!"
15,2018-10-07,['hiking'],"Trail is a nice trail, packed dirt. Went on 10-5-18, and fall colors are amazing. the view at the end is well worth the hike. stunning overlook views throughout the hike. Took parents who are in their 50s and not acclimated to the elevation and they were able to make it the whole hike (they are in decent shape though). Took us 1.5 hours to get to the top at a slowish pace and 45 minutes to get back down at a quick pace. From car and back, my phone tracked the entire hike at 5.59 miles."
16,2018-09-15,['hiking'],Fall colors are showing. Great in the early morning.
17,2018-08-29,['hiking'],Fun trail with a nice overlook at the end. Hiked a weekday and very few people out.
18,2018-08-10,[''],Great trail. Pretty stacked with mountain bikers.
19,2018-07-30,['hiking'],"This is a well-maintained, mostly shaded trail with a gorgeous view at the top. The hike took me three hours round-trip, including a half-hour stop to soak in the view at the summit (I am a pretty novice hiker). I started the hike at 6 pm on a Sunday evening and I had the trail to myself, other than two polite mountain bikers and one large moose."
20,2018-07-28,[''],This is a great hike for most people in good health. The trail is well marked and very few rocks. The scenery is very beautiful and the payoff at the end is amazing. We did the hike in about 2 1/2 hours including spending about 20 minutes at the top.  It was 100 degrees in the valley and about 72 at the summit which was very refreshing.
21,2018-07-25,['hiking'],"My husband and I and Scout dog completed this hike on July 22.

This was a wonderful hike!  Most of the way up is a mild-moderate incline, and the trail is partially shaded. The day we went was overcast and a bit cooler, so we didn't even need to stop for water on the way up. 

The trail is easy to follow, and has a great endpoint. Would definitely recommend this trail to any hiker!"
22,2018-07-19,['hiking'],Great hike!  At a quick pace it will take about 2 hours to complete.
23,2018-07-11,[''],"This was a fun, quick hike that would be great for families, because there aren't any rocky/bouldered areas to negotiate, and the incline is really gradual. Certain areas were shaded, but others were fairly exposed to the sun and somewhat overgrown -- which worried me a little bit, because there are some prime rattlesnake spots, so do be cautious. It took us about an hour and forty minutes round trip, but we took it at a fairly quick pace, so I'd allot 2-2.5 hours for a more leisurely pace."
24,2018-07-09,['hiking'],This was a moderate hike with good shade. There are mountain bikers but we weren’t bothered by them. We took the dog who enjoyed the little steam and pond at the bottom. Great views at the top.
25,2018-07-06,['walking'],Good hike for kids. Amazing views at the overlook.
26,2018-06-24,[''],"Overall, a nice trail that’s not strenuous. The view at the end is a good payoff for your time. I’d suggest this as a good family hike, since little ones will probably be okay. The only drawback is that this trail seems to be very popular with mountain bikers and there can be a lot of traffic at times. There are sometimes a few that go too fast for the safety of hikers on this trail."
27,2018-06-11,[''],"Nice little hike with some wonderful views, well shaded for large parts of it"
28,2018-06-08,[''],"Beautiful views,  mostly shaded trail which I loved, great hike, will be doing it again!"
29,2018-06-02,['trail running'],Spectacular views and a well maintained trail. The mnt bikers need to learn some trail.etiquette. Other than that I would love to go back a do some more exploring.
30,2018-03-13,['hiking'],Trail was pretty snow packed - I had coils on but you probably could have made it without. View at the top was unbeatable. Took me about 3 hours round trip!
31,2018-02-09,['hiking'],Great easy hike that’s good for anyone of all ages. Out and back in about 3 hours and it was a leisurely pace. Spikes were helpful today in some parts but given the weather you could have made it without.
32,2017-10-22,[''],"Wonderful hike! Gradual incline, lovely views at the top. One of my favorite hikes!"
33,2017-10-07,['hiking'],"A top fave of mine! If you do this go all the way to the top, you won't be disappointed- the views are spectacular!"
34,2017-10-02,['hiking'],"most excellent trail.  on the easy side of moderate,  we'll established with enough space for hiking and bicycles. couldn't find anything bad to say at all. come on out and have fun."
35,2017-09-18,[''],Fabulous views all the way up.
36,2017-07-12,[''],We loved this hike!! It's shady most of the way. Lots of beautiful wildflowers and trees. We saw moose which was also very exciting! The view on top is amazing!
37,2017-07-05,[''],"One if my favorite out and backs. Fairly smooth, clean trail. Great variety of trees--Quakies, Oaks, Maples, Pines.  Nice trail to introduce newer riders to the pleasures of mountain bikes while still interesting to more experienced riders. Want more workout or excitement?  Simply crank up your speed. Beautiful view from the top. Several hawks generally circle overhead. I've seen plenty of deer in the evenings and even a massive black moose."
38,2017-07-04,['trail running'],Perfect trail for running! It had a nice steady incline but not too steep! Beautiful view on the way and at the top!
39,2017-06-26,[''],"Loved this hike! Stunning views, nice shade, gorgeous flowers, relatively easy but still got a work out in. Stumbled upon a rattlesnake so be careful. :)"
40,2017-06-19,[''],loved the hike. doing it again for sure. saw a squirrel.
41,2017-06-07,['hiking'],
42,2017-01-03,[''],nice view
43,2016-11-20,['hiking'],I really enjoyed this hike! I brought my 5 month old puppy on the hike (she was on a leash) and I thought it was a quite easy hike. Great views on the way up and the view on the top was great! We started the hike on a Friday at about 11 and the trail had moderate traffic. It was about 50/50 cyclists and hikes but everyone was quite courteous of each other. I will definitely do this hike again!
44,2016-11-04,[''],its not hard going up there not so many rocks in the trail and a lot of deere going there i like to go up there one more time
45,2016-10-14,['hiking'],easy hike great views. only downside is people can ride horses on trail so there was alot of horse poop on trail.q
46,2016-10-11,[''],Nice hike! Not too difficult...but still a good workout. Great view of Ogden Canyon and beyond at the top!
47,2016-10-03,[''],Pretty gentle climb up to a spectacular view of Ogden and the Great Salt Lake.  Beautiful foliage along the way.  Need to share the trail with lots of mountain bikers.
48,2016-09-26,[''],easy trail with beautiful views. we saw 4 moose along the trail.
49,2016-09-22,['hiking'],"Very easy trail to hike , trail is in great condition I'd rate this trail as easy we hiked 3 miles in 1 hour 37 minutes to the over look , we continued up Sardine Trail 1 mile then handed back . There are a few benches to sit and rest .. Great trail for Horses, biking , hiking , running .. Or a good stroll.
The views are Amazing , colors are popping right now .. One of my favorite hikes"
50,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Pretty easy hike, but great view at the end!"
51,2016-08-31,['hiking'],Nice trail good reward at the end
52,2016-08-20,[''],this trail is 6 miles round trip
53,2016-08-14,[''],Great hike with the family! 7 month old Harlow and 2 year old Camdyn did wonderful.
54,2016-08-13,['hiking'],"My wife and our 2 year old twins love this hike, there is a little bit of everything for everyone. Don't be surprised if you come across hikes, mountain bikers and horses on this trail. Often times we venture down all the little trails that come across Maples.

We have taken several of our friends, their kids and also our parents on this hike. It is perfect for any age and people of any skill set. Enjoy!"
55,2016-08-05,['hiking'],Love this trail! It's very peaceful and shaded. It's perfect for after work because it's not too steep. I would say it's an easy trail. Make sure you bring big spray.
56,2016-07-29,[''],For a mountain biking trail this is fantastic a lot of densely shaded Trail but breaking out into beautiful views and overlooks and thrilling smooth downhill
57,2016-06-04,['hiking'],Nice trail. Great view of the mouth of Ogden Canyon at the top. Nice climb but very gradual.
58,2015-03-30,[''],Nice trail but could be better marked on the maps near the snowbasin parking lot. View from the top was gorgeous. Will hit Sardine Peak soon
59,2013-06-24,['hiking'],"This trail is awesome for any family, my 2 & 5 year old loved it. They were exhausted by the time it was done, but the scenery was great and it stayed a lot cooler than other trails. "
60,2012-08-08,['hiking'],This is a great trail to bring the family on.  There was a little bit of everything on this trail to keep everyone interested.  The views of course are excellent and if you are out for a lot longer hike then you can head on over to Sardine Peak.
61,2012-07-23,['hiking'],"This is a nice trail which climbs from the lower Snowbasin parking lot (it looks to me like the marker isn't quite in the right spot) up to a ridge overlooking Ogden Canyon.  It's a good trail, not too demanding.  Nice to cool off when Ogden is hot!  I've hiked, mt. biked, and pushed a double stroller up it."
