Which is fine, just wanted to let others know before hitting the trail with expectation of 9 miles. Once you get to the over look and keep going, the trail does narrow a little and have some over growth for about .10-.15 of a mile and then it opens back up to single trail.  Keep in mind you are in a mountain range and climbing up and up so it is going to be over grown at some parts and steep as hell at others. The way up takes some time and you hit some nice cold patches. The scenery is gorgeous and worth the clim. You end at the intersection of Neff's Canyon Trail and Desolation trail. "

2,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']",The cover picture is deceiving. Pretty much wooded switchbacks the whole way with little change in scenery. Not the diverse hike with views I was hoping for. No signage beyond the original trailhead...which isn't really necessary until you get to the city overlook where it's easy to lose the trail. Nice panoramic view from there. Some bugs at overlook. The trail beyond the overlook is narrow and very overgrown...you'll have to bushwack if you want to continue beyond the overlook. I turned around as it's pretty dense. No snow July 1.
3,2019-05-26,"['trail running', 'snow']","Made it to 3.8 miles in. Too much snow for me and my trail runners. Very nice trail, runnable. "
4,2019-05-07,[''],"Beautiful trail, made it up to the about 5km from the trailhead but couldn't make it to the lake due to snow. You need spikes and poles  (May 4th). Will be back later in the year to complete the hike!"
5,2019-04-28,['hiking'],"I've hiked this trail five times now, and it's my absolute favorite along the Wasatch Front.  The switchbacks are very diverse and you just can't beat the incredible canopy of conifers.  Hiked it again today and the conditions were favorable, but be careful of some ice patches that still remain."
6,2019-01-08,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. Make sure to bring good hiking shoes for the slippery parts.
7,2018-09-23,['backpacking'],Great hike. Bring enough water. Great view at the end.
8,2018-09-16,['hiking'],"nice easy hike, mostly in shade. Overlook at around 3m. Good amount of off leash dogs on odd days, definitely  a good hike for the dogs."
9,2018-06-13,[''],gorgeous flowers!
10,2018-06-03,['hiking'],"There's an off-trail somewhere between 4-4.5 miles up that's pretty easy to miss due to some overgrowth, stay diligent with tracking your location.  That trail actually takes you to the top.  Otherwise, the hike is very mellow and only  gains around 500ft/mile and is very well shaded.  You'll meet plenty of doggos along the way so if you're one of those people who sneer whenever other people have the audacity to have dogs, maybe try a different trail."
11,2018-05-27,[''],Great haunts.
12,2018-05-07,['trail running'],"Had a beautiful hike and run on the Desolation Trail yesterday. At about 3 miles in and above 7,500 feet I started running into a lot of snow. I pushed through until just after the marked route diverges from the deso trail and heads towards the top of Neff's canyon (about 3.5 miles in, just over 8,000 feet), where I decided to turn back. It's a drainage up there, so there's quite a bit of snow. Not very doable to the top of Neff's yet unless you have waterproof shoes, maybe some spikes, and a big hiking stick. Give it a month and it'll be perfect. I'll be back!"
13,2018-01-27,['hiking'],Never ever do this hike in the winter
14,2017-09-17,[''],Not any signs to tell you where you are
15,2017-07-28,['hiking'],"Love this hike! I can take my dogs, the ground is soft, there are trees shading the entire way, and it's beautiful!

I however, got 10.7 miles recorded on my Garmin from the parking lot to the rock peak and back."
16,2017-07-16,['trail running'],More than a moderate hike/run. Views are stunning!
17,2017-06-30,[''],This is a great hike during the hot months of summer. It offers plenty of shade and beautiful greenery with a gorgeous lookout point.
18,2017-06-12,[''],Did this trail yesterday and loved it
19,2017-05-08,['hiking'],One of the coolest trails I've been on.
20,2017-03-22,[''],"One of my favorites hike, most of the trail is pretty shaded,  there are two places where you walk through spots of beautiful wild flowers. 
The lake is really pretty and due to the length, there usually isn't tons of people up there."
21,2016-10-20,[''],"If you want a hike, I guarantee this is something you wanna walk if you want to see what work your legs. It's steep and a good workout. I been walking this trail on my deer hunt, and it's one of the challenging hike I been on. Great workout."
22,2016-09-18,['hiking'],"Great trail! I only went to the overlook point because the lake was 18 miles in and I wasn't prepped for that long of a hike. The trail is quite rocky and steep in some places, flat in others . It is very narrow and on the way down I ran most of it . Despite the fact that some people have absolutely no trail etiquette and refuse to move when they are coming up and I was going down ( which luckily didn't cause any collisions) , most people moved over politely and were friendly . I had a great time ! Will be going back, perhaps earlier and on a weekday . Happy Trails !!"
23,2016-07-23,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike all the way up! I took my 6 year old, so we took a lot of breaks. But it was totally worth it!"
24,2016-07-11,['hiking'],
25,2016-07-08,['hiking'],"Fun trail! Millcreek is always so cool and peaceful. Our five year old had fun, too!"
26,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"Nicely maintained trail, you do have to climb over some rocks a few times but it's not too bad. You are climbing upwards most of the time.  This was my first hike in a long time and this was a bit hard since I'm not used to the high altitude yet. The others in my group live here and they were fine with the trail, not so out of breath like me. The view at the top is very beautiful.  You can see Salt Lake City and the Salt Lake from a high view point.  It was very green going up with lots of very large trees, and lots of different green ground covers.  Lots of shade on this trail, with quite a few sections of strong sun.  Bring lots of water!!  I was in a group and some people ran out.  Saw a large rattlesnake on the trail at the bottom, that was interesting!"
27,2016-05-30,['hiking'],Fun trail and a good hike for me and my 2 yr old. I did it with him in my hiking bag and he enjoyed it.
28,2016-05-28,[''],Awesome!
29,2016-05-27,['hiking'],"This trail is beautiful and green this time of year! We didn't see any streams but the trees, moss, bushes, and rocks were incredible! Especially with the light rain coming down half the hike! My dog loved running up and down this trail with me!!!!"
30,2016-05-08,['hiking'],Awesome on a rainy day very beautiful and quiet trail. also good for beginner hiking dogs because there's not very many places they can go to get lost.
31,2016-04-16,['hiking'],Went last week. Mud and snow cover most of the first mile. Then it's all snow after that. We weren't able to make it to the lake without snow shoes as the snow was a few feet deep and we kept sinking. Made it past the trailhead heading to dog lake and was only able to make it another half mile or so before turning around and heading up to Dog Lake. Which was still iced over a bit
32,2015-09-09,['trail running'],Loved this trail. Did not make it all the way to the lake but it was beautiful the whole time I was running. Very quiet.
33,2015-09-08,['camping'],"Backpacked with 50lb packs. Tough @ times. When the sun is out up at the top it is worth it. Great places to camp overnight in the trees towards the back side of the lake. The peaks surrounding the lake can be summited and you can see all the way back into the SL valley, but once up there you realize you are even closer to PC. You can see both cities and Solitude and Brighton resorts. Baller."
34,2015-08-08,['hiking'],Beautiful.  One of my favorite hikes.  Easy enough slope to hike without stopping.
35,2015-07-26,['hiking'],Awesome hike!!
36,2015-05-23,[''],"I've done this hike several times (4.5 miles of it, anyway), and haven't tired of it yet.  It's not too steep or difficult...overall a great hike!"
37,2014-12-07,['hiking'],Desolation Trail in Big Cottonwood Canyon is one of my favorites.  Thought I would check this one out.  Pretty quiet and beautiful.  Did not make it to the lake unfortunately I ran out of time.  Will go back.
38,2014-06-07,['hiking'],I only made it 4 1/2 miles up the trail after joining it from the shorter Thaynes Canyon trail. I was looking for the Neffs Canyon trail and either missed it because of a snow drift or was just short of the junction. I returned down this trail after reaching the Desolation/Thaynes junction and hiked past the Salt Lake City lookout. Great hike with a lot of solitude until I reached the Salt Lake overlook and passed a steady stream of people the rest of the way down to the trailhead.
