1,2019-08-28,['hiking'],"The trail itself was very narrow and on the edge of the cliff. I had two dogs so I was uncomfortable at actually going all the way in on the trail. However where you park there is a huge wide bike track that long, that was awesome and perfect for the dogs and I to get in our exercise and feel safe"
2,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']",Nice place to hike... Beware of rattlesnakes 
3,2019-08-17,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'washed out']",
4,2019-08-14,['trail running'],"We hike and trail run this trail regularly up to the waterfall and back. It’s a great hike, plenty of shade and well groomed. Beware however, today we came close to stepping on two rattle snakes that were just off the trail. Fortunately we heard the rattle first  "
5,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"The route to the trailhead is a steep dirt/gravel road. You don’t really need a high clearance vehicle, I carefully drove it in my Chevy Volt. Just avoid the large rocks and ditches. 
The trail is pretty easy for the most part. There are some areas where you scramble over some large rock outcroppings. Other than that, the journey is fairly doable for most people. The trail does have some short steep segments but 75% of the trail is a modest climb in elevation.
 I saw a few families on this trail. There is a large rope swing roughly a mile in and some permanent campsites with custom built benches along the path. I would highly recommend this trial to other people."
6,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Great trail with lots of shade that ends at a beautiful waterfall. Would warn that parts of the trail are a bit difficult and technical. Some spots are narrow and steep, and there is an area where you need to climb over rocks, which may be difficult for some. "
7,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Easy trail to follow, a few muddy places, but not a problem. Lots of wild raspberries and butterflies. There is one area where the trail crosses the stream that isn’t as obvious as the bridges. There is a marker on the tree across the stream, but if you miss it it’s easy to get back on the main trail.  I really enjoyed this hike. I agree with the moderate rating.  And the falls are beautiful!  Lots of vegetation and shade. "
8,2019-08-01,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Awesome hike!! We ventured the North trailhead in rather than the South. It’s definitely more challenging. However, I was so pleased once we made it over by the creek. The trees provided a lot of much needed shade. The hard work was so worth the rewards. "
9,2019-08-01,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'rocky']","I saw this hike was moderate, thought to myself “oh this shouldn’t be too bad” I’ve done many moderate hikes so I thought this one would be nice for a Thursday morning... right?? Wrong, you get a half mile in, yes, HALF MILE in and your basically rock climbing. On the way to that point I saw a bunch of kids and some very heavily pregnant women so I really thought this trail wouldn’t be bad. Couldn’t even finish it. It was very steep in some places, very rocky and slippery. Thin small trail that can only fit a single file line of people. The woman I asked up here said once you get past the extremely steep rocky part at the half mile mark, it gets slightly better but is still steep. Moderate my butt.... I might come back later without the dogs and do this with just people, but definitely couldn’t do today. "
10,2019-07-30,['hiking'],"What an awesome trail! I almost did not do this hike because I was running out of time, but I'm so glad I did. I got a late start, starting at 7:45 p.m.  so  the way back was mostly in the dark. It took me just under two hours to get to the 2.5 mile marker and back. highly recommend this one. and kind of fun to do at night as well. "
11,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"One of the best trails I've done so far this year not too challenging, The views are amazing and the waterfall is easy to get to. Will definitely do this one again."
12,2019-07-28,['hiking'],A really nicely shaded trail! The falls are quite nice and there were a lot of Wild Raspberries to pluck along the trail! 
13,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"So many wasps everywhere! Ran into a couple nests on the side of one of the bridges. Also, I think someone may have cut down the rope swing as there was just a small bit of rope left hanging from the tree. I would probably rate this on the harder side of moderate just because it's pretty much uphill the entire way. The creek is very pretty and it stayed pretty cool all the way up."
14,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
15,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble']",One of my favorite trails! Nice shady hike and very beautiful!  Seen a gopher snake at the beginning of the trail. Very narrow at the beginning of the trail but not bad after the boulders. Some steep areas. Our 3yr old was able to do the hike to the waterfall and back w/some assistance (just took a little longer). We really enjoyed the fun rope swing as well.
16,2019-07-08,['hiking'],nice shady hike
17,2019-07-01,['hiking'],"This was a beautiful hike with lots of shade. There is a fun swing a little over a mile up that my boys really enjoyed. If you have kids in tow and they don't want to go past the swing, I don't think you are missing out. The waterfall is pretty, but not worth hearing complaining kids and fighting kids for another 1.3 miles. Your best experience would be to go without children and actually enjoy how beautiful and peaceful it could be there. "
18,2019-06-30,[''],We loved this trail♥️
19,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Looooved this hike. Took my 2 dogs and they loved the creek following the entire trail. Steep incline up to the top. We went to the very end of the trail, past the waterfall, and it was very overgrown. You pass the 2.5 mile mark. Green everything and the river is flowing! swing was fun too! Forgot to start my app when we went back down so this is only showing the way up!"
20,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"Love this hike, we've done it a few times. Went at the end of June - lots of wildflowers and shade.  Our dog loves the water, we love the rope swing.  Fairly overgrown right now the closer you get to the waterfall."
21,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike! We started on the North Deuel Creek Trail and it was pretty dry and far away from the waterfalls. I knew this wasn’t the trail I wanted, so we hiked back, found the South trail and it was amazing! There was a lot of shade and the trail was fairly flat most of the way. I will definitely hike this again making sure I start on the South Trail. "
22,2019-06-27,"['hiking', 'bugs']","This was such a great hike! Lots of shade, so it’s a great evening hike, no matter the temp. The breeze off the creek also helps keep the temps lower. The falls were beautiful! I also loved all the mini waterfalls you could find along the way up. We went at about 6pm and no one was there. Got a bit crowded as we came back down...mostly around the rope swing. There were quite a few bugs. I got bit a few times by flies. The trail is pretty easy to follow...there is a short scramble near the beginning, but it’s not hard. I will definitely do this one again. 

Please note that you need a high clearance vehicle to get to the trailhead. Luckily my friend did because there was NO WAY my Mazda 3 could have made it. It’s a very rough road. There is also construction right now on the neighborhood road leading to the dirt road. We had to ask some of the workers to move their vehicles so that we could get past them."
23,2019-06-26,['hiking'],My new favorite hike. 
24,2019-06-25,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. Lots of shade and awesome rope swing about 1 mile or so up. Kids loved it
25,2019-06-23,['hiking'],"good family time trail on account of the swing. very shady, nice on a hot day. I found the trails in the canyon walls toward the top of the hike to be fairly technical. good boots and attention will serve you well on this trail"
26,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'scramble']","Trail was great! Had everything you’d want: shade, waterfall, stream, a little bit of scramble, rope swing (added bonus), and it wasn’t too crowded- and we went on a Saturday morning!

I would note, the dirt road that leads to the trail is a bit sketchy and almost made like an atv trail, but it is in fact the road that leads to the trailhead.

Lastly, there’s unfortunately a shooting range right next to the trail. Which you can hear people shooting guns while you’re hiking. This made my dog very scared he had a hard time hiking and we were basically tripping over him because he was so scared. So if your dog is scared of loud sounds, which most are, just know that. 
"
27,2019-06-22,['hiking'],Excellent trail.  It stars with Shade and you are in the shade the entire time making it easy to hike no matter the time of day.  Beautiful the entire way through.  Not to difficult.  There was a super fun rope swing half way through which made a good place to rest and have some fun along the way!!  Definitely going to do this hike again.
28,2019-06-16,['hiking'],"This trail is SO good! I was kind of blown away. Gorgeous scenery all the way up to the waterfall. The trail does gain pretty consistently, all the way up, so youll probably get a pretty good sweat worked up. Definitely worth a go! Im curious if camping is allowed up there, I saw a handful of camp fire rings and what looked like established camp sites. Anyone know? "
29,2019-06-16,['hiking'],We loved the trail! Nice and cool with plenty of access to water for the dogs. We did see a few snakes today (a big rattler just off the trail and a gopher snake) so beware they’re out and about!
30,2019-06-15,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Since it was our first time it was really confusing how to actually get to the trailhead. The description says it starts at the top of 100 South where the dirt road begins. But you actually have to  take a right at the fork and drive way up a dirt road and around a few bends before you get to the parking lot where the Deuel creek south trail begins (the one that’s shady and along the river). And the dirt road is definitely difficult in a small car. But we loved the trail and the water access for our dogs! Kind of skinny and hard to pass others when you’ve got dogs but still fun! 
31,2019-06-14,['hiking'],great hike.  moderate. not for wimps.  the swing is fixed.  mostly in the shade.  
32,2019-06-12,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! Very shady, and cool hiking along side the river. We hiked all the way to the waterfall, and it was definitely worth it. The rope swing is fixed, and very fun. Not a hike for whimps!"
33,2019-06-11,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Popular trail, great for kids (but please watch them since the streams are so high this year)! They fixed the rope swing and the washed out bridge! I love taking beginning hikers on this trail because it is rewarding to make it to the swing and even more so if they make it to the waterfall!"
34,2019-06-09,['hiking'],"Good hike kids love coming out for  the robe swing, however it has NOT been fixed so heads up Incase you are planning on hiking up for the swing. "
35,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Beautiful hike with lots of shade. The trail stays along the river for the majority of the hike and there’s plenty of little waterfalls along the way. I took my 6 year old and he did great, although we only made it about half way. The trail is pretty muddy in some parts."
36,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'scramble']",
37,2019-06-08,['hiking'],"I loved every minute of it.  Not leisurely, so don’t expect that.  Rope swing is fixed.  Waterfall is a great pay off.  I went up past it, but didn’t find much else.  The “bridges” are all fine and passable.  It is almost completely shaded.  "
38,2019-06-07,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Trail is still mostly wet from the constant rain. Some parts are muddy. It gets chilly towards the end of the trail. 
39,2019-06-04,[''],The trail was pretty clear... only muddy in a couple spots. I love this hike with my 4 little ones. They were so sad the swing was broken! Someone please fix the rope swing!!!! 
40,2019-06-04,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Our first time hiking this trail and it was an Awesome! Hiked with 2 kids (9 and 12) and 3 dogs. The kids said it was medium hike for them. Lots of shade and the majority of the trail is right next to the stream. Muddy in some spots but not bad at all. Def recommend this hike. 
41,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",Absolutely gorgeous!! This is my new favorite hike. 
42,2019-05-27,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'washed out']",
43,2019-05-19,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Super fun hike!  Waterfall was awesome!
"
44,2019-05-17,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Hiked the north trail today in light rain. The first 3/4 mile is a climb and not much shade, so in warmer weather come prepared. Once you get into the canyon however, the trail stops climbing so quickly and there are plenty of trees to keep it shady. 

The river was roaring today from the rain last night, but both of the little bridges before the rope swing were well above water and sturdy. I turned around at the swing because of time, but still a great quick hike. Started at 11 and was back in my car by 12:45, even with stopping to eat a snack at the swing for a while. "
45,2019-05-16,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Great trail. Currently a bit muddy past the rope swing. Going to require some balance or tall boots.
46,2019-05-14,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky']","As I'm still getting back into the season, this trail kicked my butt. I'd probably rate it on the harder side of moderate. Only one snowy spot left that was easy to get over in Tevas. Lots of constant ups and downs on the Deuel Creek North trail and once the North and South trails merge. Beautiful spring nature and the waterfall at the end is really going! Tree limbs and many rocks on trail. "
47,2019-05-06,['hiking'],at the end it was too snowy for me to keep going. I saw two others turn around as well. muddy but not too bad. beautiful trail.
48,2019-05-06,"['muddy', 'snow']","Great trail today, some snowy patches towards the end at the waterfall but not too bad. Some muddy spots. Rope swing is broken, if you see it ""fixed"" I still wouldn't recommend trying it. When we arrived at that point my son was about to swing on it and he gave the chain a little shake and down it came. Glad he wasnt on it when it happened. Found out on our way back down someone else had just climbed up the tree and reattached it but obviously it wasn't successful."
49,2019-05-05,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Super fun trail. The rope swing is down. Last mile gets pretty muddy but not too bad. The waterfall is beautiful! Some parts of the hike got pretty steep but overall it was doable and a great experience.
50,2019-05-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'no shade']","We started at the north trail head because our car couldn’t make it up to the lookout. The first half of the trail was grueling (I carried our toddler on my back) with steep inclines, but once we made it to the water it was absolutely incredible. The hike along the water down to the south trailhead was beautiful and much, much easier on both me and our toddler. Other reviewers mentioned the bridge being washed out, but we crossed three bridges today so it seems that they’re open again. Once at the south trailhead, we got back to the street we parked on by walking on the fire road and down a few smaller trails. Definitely will do again."
51,2019-05-04,"['hiking', 'bridge out']",Love this hike! Some pleasant waterfalls and gorgeous rock formations.  Went about 1.75 up instead of the full 2.25 because a bridge was washed out.
52,2019-05-04,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",We made it all the way to the waterfall but got pretty wet along the way and there was some snowy patches. Awesome trail but it would probably be better in a few weeks.
53,2019-04-27,"['hiking', 'bridge out']","Really fun and adventurous hike that I want to do again. Perfect moderate difficulty that won't strain you too hard, with about 8 creek crossings. Most creek crossings had bridges, but on the 6th one the bridge was out. Not a major issue and was able to get through anyway, even with the creek flowing fast from melt water. Near the end, trail became much more rough and somewhat snowy, but with decent hiking boots it wasn't a problem. Hike completed on the 27th of April, 2019."
54,2019-04-21,[''],"Beautiful hike. Didn't make it to the waterfall, the river is running too high to cross at the top. Will do this one again."
55,2019-02-25,[''],I love doing the loop on this trail.  It is quick and fun. My dogs love it too.
56,2019-02-10,[''],"one of my favorite trails. 
the entire thing follows a gorgeus river lined with trees. the rope swing is fun, and the terrain keeps most people away. nice, pretty, low-travel hike."
57,2019-01-11,['hiking'],"Gorgeous hike up along the creek the whole way. Many small waterfalls, 10 bridge crossings and icicles from the cold. The snow gets deeper and deeper as you go along. There is a really cool swing and a fire pit if you want to sit by the creek and have a fire. The rock formations are also amazing. Some narrow trails with steep drop off's for those who are scared of heights. But only at the beginning."
58,2019-01-10,[''],Beautiful in winter!
59,2018-12-31,['snowshoeing'],Narrow canyon and not very interesting for me. I few nice views
60,2018-10-15,[''],Great trail wouldn’t recommend taking dogs on This trail it get really narrow and especially hard when people are trying to pass up and down the trail. Very pretty and shady. Inclined become more aggressive near the end. Good for older kids. Plan on hiking out with little ones on shoulders or packs
61,2018-10-02,[''],Yahoo
62,2018-09-11,[''],"first time hiking this trail.  wow, 70 foot drops on sandy unstable slopes. rock walls.  had to turn around,  sketchy!"
63,2018-09-10,['hiking'],"This was a very awkward hike. Kind of confusing on which trail to follow the further up you go. Trail isn’t well maintained, and is very dangerous in some parts. A lot of wasps on the trail where the trail is wet from the creek. Wasn’t all that scenic either. Only pro I can think of is you get a workout from it and it’s shaded. Won’t be doing this trail again."
64,2018-09-05,['hiking'],"This is a nice trail for a hot day as the temperature in the canyon is much cooler and the trail is almost completely shaded. Be aware that the drive up is a bit precarious! However, we made it just fine in my Ford Focus. Once snow hits I imagine this is inaccessible wo 4WD. 

The trail follows the creek, the “swing” is about 1.1 miles into the hike. The trail can be really packed to that point, but was fairly empty past it. A lot of ppl seem to turn back at that point. As other mentioned, the trail does just “end” near the waterfall at the top. We hiked early in the morning when cooler, but as it warmed on our way down, the bees came out in full force! Something to be aware of if you have little kids, pets with you. At least during the end of summer. Nice hike with the dog bc tons of water access. Round trip about 5 miles in about 2.5hrs. I would definitely visit again"
65,2018-08-27,[''],"This hike you are basically walking along side a water feature, shaded nearly the whole way made this a fantastic way to get out of the heat. The waterfall is smaller than most in the area but still pretty. For those that are curious like me, there isn't anything past the waterfall. We noticed there was a 2.5 mile marker past the waterfall so continued up. The trail ends at a trail marker pretty anticlimactic."
66,2018-08-26,['hiking'],"We went the ~1.1 miles to the swing and the kids loved it. Turn RIGHT at the end of 100 south up the very bumpy road. The first time we accidentally did the north trail which is hot, exposed, and miserable. The south trail is shady and scenic."
67,2018-08-19,[''],Very nice trail with shade most of the time.
68,2018-07-17,[''],Great trail that stays in shade and cover
69,2018-07-13,[''],South trail was nice and fairly comfortable to get out of the 102 degree weather. There is a lot of wasps on the trail and a few snakes. was a bit disappointed in the falls but I'd still do this trail again as it was shaded a lot be and it follows the creek the whole way so no problem with a water source.
70,2018-07-09,['hiking'],"My family and I (husband, 4 year old and two dogs) took the south trail today from the trailhead to the top of the waterfall. My Apple Watch put us at over 5 miles and it took us over 4 hours, with breaks in the water for the dogs and a break at the top for some snacks. It wasn’t a bad hike although there were some areas that worried me a bit with my 4 year old (drops straight down with one minor slip). Some parts of the trail seemed pretty overgrown too and we were walking basically straight through plants. We had fun at the rope swing which is right next to the water so great place for the dogs to cool off too. Mostly shaded with a few areas of sun. Much hotter on our way up than on the way down. All in all it was a good hike for all of us. The dogs did great and so did our 4 year old for it being his second hike. You will come out dirty as it is fairly dusty and some areas are must. My husband had an awesome “tan” on his legs from all the dirt and our son’s face was covered in dirt"
71,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"Driving up to the trail head was a little scary for me in my little sedan (but I made it just fine!).  Lots of areas where it is washed out and steep.  It was a lovely hike along the stream, but the trail became overtaken with vegetation.  Didn't see a whole lot of people on my way up, but on the way down there was more.  I thought the falls were pretty but I was expecting something bigger.  I would do this hike again with some friends though."
72,2018-07-03,[''],Took our 3 and 5 year olds. Plus the dog. They all loved it. Might be a little long for littles so come prepared with snacks and take breaks.
73,2018-06-24,['hiking'],"This trial is a bit confusing. Not clearly marked (exact trail name or mileage)  we just took a trail that lead us back into the mountains.  We ended up taking the north trail in (full sun, large elevation gain) and the south trail out.  NOTE: South trail is much better.  It’s Shaded, runs right along the water etc. We started about 6pm and got down around 9:15pm.  Only ran into 1 small family going up and a few small groups on the way down.  They were camping.  It was around 2.3 miles in and 2.3 miles out.   We did spend some time at a small waterfall (not sure if it was the main attraction or not)  and then headed down.  Saw multiple snakes, trail was packed with dragon flys, mesquites, grasshoppers, and foxtails (not so great for dogs - glad I didn’t bring my pup).  There are a few camping sites right in the middle of the trails, and a fun swing.  The trail can be a bit scary at times (steep drop offs, lose rocks and dirt) but overall is was a good hike.  The waterfall that we saw wasn’t all that great, however still refreshing.  May venture out again at some point."
74,2018-06-03,[''],My husband and i took our 3 and 5 year olds and wore our baby in the pack. There is one area that’s a little scary with kids but not worth missing this hike and swing! The swing was so fun. The kids loved it. The hike was fairly easy. Only a few areas that were steep.
75,2018-06-02,['hiking'],"I took my 5 year old daughter on this hike and we loved it. The highlight was definitely the rope swing for her. The hike is nice and shaded on the south trail. It gets a little rocky at parts so I agree with the moderate rating. The water fall is pretty, but not as nice as some of the other ones around. We definitely will do this hike again and just go up to the swing."
76,2018-06-02,[''],"Fun,  mostly shaded hike. May be too challenging for littles.  Tends to get a little crowded."
77,2018-05-27,['hiking'],great hike in the summer lots of shade rope swing was fun beautiful scenery
78,2018-05-25,[''],"Awesome trail. I took my ten year old my Jack Russel and everyone did fine. It was a little more challenging than the average trail, but not too bad and definitely worth it."
79,2018-05-25,['hiking'],SO MANY PEOPLE -   trail is not wide enough and so it is hard to pass.    Not sure would bring kids -  saw a couple snakes on the path today.  also has poison ivy.
80,2018-05-20,['hiking'],We took our two poms up who love to hike. It was a fun trail and was beautiful with the run off from the waterfall the whole way up. Don’t recommend bringing small kids as there are narrow areas that are a dangerous fall. Plan on being a little muddy by the time you get back to your car. Will definitely do it again!
81,2018-05-20,[''],"I took my 5 & 6 yr olds up to the swing. It was an awesome adventure and the swing was a BLAST... but I wouldn’t take a 5 yr old or younger again. There were some steep drop offs and we had a close call. Going to the swing was a pretty tough workout for two average kiddos. Also- be careful where you park, I saw many ticked vehicles on the side of the paved road that connects to the dirt road."
82,2018-05-17,[''],"A fun hike, many creek crossings over log bridges bound together. A cool rope swing halfway to the waterfall, kids (and me) loved that. More rugged and rustic than other, better maintained trails."
83,2018-04-30,[''],"My least favorite hike around. Hard to access. If you don’t have 4 wheel drive, don’t bother. Lots of dog poop on the trail and the swing is poorly maintained."
84,2018-03-13,['hiking'],It was absolutely beautiful! There’s quite a drop off at the beginning but super worth it to see the stream. My pups loved every bit of it!
85,2018-02-19,[''],So beautiful in the snow!
86,2018-02-18,[''],"This is a hidden gem! There’s a lot swing about a mile up the trail, and a couple decent waterfalls as well. The trail is definitely moderate, you get your blood pumping but nothing too hard."
87,2018-02-05,[''],Very little snow on the trail right now. Muddy in some spots. Fun little hike!
88,2018-02-04,[''],"great trail, but icy towards the end so need shoe spikes. when you are about 0.5 miles in the trail seems to disappear, you just need to continue over the jagged rocks and the trail picks back up. dog loved the trail."
89,2018-01-03,['hiking'],"This is my favorite hike. So close to town but you feel like you are miles away. This was the first time hiking it in the Winter. We had trouble getting up to the trailhead since the first part of the dirt road was icy. We just parked at the bottom and hiked up. The first half mile of the south trail was pretty icy and I wish I’d brought my traction spikes. Then the next 1.5 miles was pretty easy with packed snow conditions and we made good time. The closer we got to the waterfall, the narrower the trail and the more powdery the snow. It wasn’t impassible in just boots, but snowshoes might have kept us from sinking in so much. Overall still a great hike."
90,2017-12-27,[''],Loved this trail!
91,2017-11-29,['hiking'],"This was a beautiful, shaded hike that runs by the creek the entire way. It takes about around 3.25 miles (6.5 miles round trip) to the waterfall and it wasn't that scenery, but right before you get to the waterfall (looking up in the open sky) you are all alone in the valley of the mountain surrounded by tall pine trees - it was an amazing peaceful sight I have ever experienced. I tried to continue to hike pass the waterfall about 0.05 miles ahead and ended up seeing some small fallen trees in the middle of the creek that hindered me to go further more. I noticed a faded trail on the right side of the hill that has been used before, it looked too slippery for me to climb on it and decided to head back."
92,2017-11-26,['hiking'],Thoroughly enjoy this hike! I love the fact it followed the stream the whole way. It was moderate with small sloping ascents and descents the whole way. Finding the trail head was a little difficult since my car couldn’t make it up the washed out dirt road and we parked on 100S. Once on the dirt road follow it up and around to the left where you’ll see the ATV Park. The trail head is in that parking area.
93,2017-11-26,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful trail. You stay by the creek the whole way, which makes it peaceful and easy to follow. The rope swing is also a lot of fun. The waterfall still flows really well in late fall which is a rarity!"
94,2017-11-13,['trail running'],Beautiful! You can’t run all of it but it was awesome.
95,2017-11-13,[''],Amazing
96,2017-11-10,['hiking'],"Good hike, nice to hear the water flowing as one hikes... nice burner heading up into the canyon... swinging on the rope swing.  Will go back in spring - waterfall will be awesome"
97,2017-10-17,[''],Will be going back! Love the waterfalls and brooks
98,2017-09-17,[''],very fun hike. my kids enjoyed it.
99,2017-09-17,[''],I saw two rattlesnakes
100,2017-09-13,[''],Great hike for families. One of my 4-year-old's favorites
101,2017-08-13,['hiking'],Me and the kids went all 4.5 miles and back. We had a great time very nice hike next to the stream and most of it in the shade. I am new to this app so I am steal learning how to make it work.
102,2017-08-11,[''],"great trail, nice history with it."
103,2017-08-05,['hiking'],
104,2017-08-03,[''],This is a fun and beautiful hike. We were able to see the Eagle's and the waterfall is so pretty! It's a new favorite!
105,2017-08-03,[''],Fun trail with kids. The rope swing is just past the 1 mile marker. Lots of places to play in the river along the way. Mostly shaded trail.
106,2017-07-27,['hiking'],"It was a beautiful trail following the river. I took my pup, and it was good for him but I'm not sure many young families would want to do this trail.  it was washed out a bit and underkept. but overall I liked it!"
107,2017-07-18,[''],"Fun hike! 2 moms who took 10 kids from ages13-2 (with babies on the back). It was a little difficult at times, but as long as you take your time on the difficult parts, it's not bad at all. Kids loved the water and the rope swing! Had a great time!"
108,2017-07-17,[''],Great trail! Loved the mile markers. Some rough places (climbing over rocks and such). Rope swing was a lot of fun! Bring plenty of water!!!! It's pretty shaded but all the terrain your going through you need to stay hydrated! Confusing finding the trail head. Once you get to the end of the paved road.....make a right! Follow around until you find a big open area to park in! I wouldn't recommend doing this one alone. There is some steep embankments that you could fall down
109,2017-07-16,['hiking'],"BEAUTIFUL trail. The terrain was rough but we got through with kids in tow. There's something beautiful to look at the entire hike. The trail stays within view of the creek for most of the time. There is a rope swing about 1.25 miles in, which the kids and adults both loved. There were a good number of hornets around the wetter parts of the trail but they left us alone as we hiked through. We will definitely hike it again."
110,2017-07-12,['hiking'],"DIRECTIONS:
The directions from All Trails will get you to an empty dirt lot, the TH starts at the wood sign on the NE side of the dirt lot. 
Let me start by saying that the Moderate rating on this trail is not for the elevation gain. There are a couple steep parts, but overall it's very gradual. It's rated Moderate because of all the different types of terrain you will cross. Right at the beginning is a pretty thin path where one side is a pretty steep drop down the canyon. There is also a huge rock formation you must go over at one point, and a pretty steep S curve around the 1 mile mark. 
One thing I wasn't expecting was the humidity. It was a normal Utah day about 85 in the valley, the trail goes right along a creek which is so pretty but the trees overhead form an arch and hold in the humidity from the river. It was so hot and made for a super sweaty hike. 
There is a rope swing about 1.25 miles in which we stopped at, because it would be only the halfway mark to the waterfall. Saw lots of butterflies, a snake and some gray squirrels. I'll try this again at a later point and see if the humidity abates a little. Beautiful hike, I wouldn't take super young kids."
111,2017-07-08,['hiking'],"My only complaint is that people aren't cleaning up after their dogs. It's a beautiful trail with plenty of shade on a hot summer day. It has a lovely stream you follow on the way up, and a fun rope swing."
112,2017-06-29,['hiking'],"Fun fun fun! Plenty of shade, a good sized stream along the entire trail, not terribly difficult we had one as young as 5 with us. We were a little bummed we couldn't really get to the waterfall to play in but we enjoyed playing in the little pools in the stream on the way down."
113,2017-06-25,[''],Very pretty. A lot of shade. Not a hard trail. Some steep parts but not physically hard at all.
114,2017-06-17,[''],"Great little hike, mostly shaded. Crosses the creek many times. Nice little falls. Would hike it again."
115,2017-06-17,[''],Nice evening hike with my husband. Saw a few snakes. Love hiking along the creek. The rope swing and waterfall make it unique.
116,2017-06-16,['hiking'],Thoroughly enjoyed our hike on this trail today!! The swing is a blast and everything was gorgeous. Hiked to the top of the waterfall.
117,2017-06-03,[''],"We went with our three kids (1 year old in carrier, 3 and 5 year old walking). It's a nice hike, really narrow a little bit past the beginning with a big drop off. A little worrisome for toddlers but we just took it slow and watched our steps. Lots of little spots to enjoy the Creek and very shaded for the most part. Kids loved crossing the little bridges to."
118,2017-06-03,['hiking'],Awesome hike this morning with my daughter.  Wonderful views on the entire trail.  Round trip it was about 4.3 miles (by my phone gps) and we did it in 2 hours 10 minutes.  I would agree that this is a moderate hike.  With all of the shade along the trail it would also be a nice hike on a hot summer day.
119,2017-06-03,[''],"This trail was somewhat of a disappointment for me. First of all it was really hard to find the trailhead. I found the South Trail head but never did find the Northtrail head. I was hiking alone and therefore wanted to be careful. My cardiovascular is good but my flexibility is not so good.  The stiffness of my body sometimes makes me not as coordinated as I'd like. The trail is narrow with steep drop offs.  There were seriously times when the trail could not accommodate the width of my legs and my Walking stick.  I got about a quarter of a mile up and came across a steep rocky ledge. I wasn't completely sure this was the trail. But then I saw someone else go up and I knew that it was. There was no way I was going to do that steep thing by myself when my mobility is not great. So I had to turn around and go back.  The trail is shaded which was nice. The scenery is pretty and I can imagine in the autumn it would be awesome. In all honesty, I will stick with Adams Canyon, though.  I think it is prettier and believe it or not easier. The trail is rated moderate and I would say it is not hard, but could be dangerous if you're not sure on your feet.  I would be afraid to take kids up there.  If I wouldn't have been alone I would have attempted the Rocky ledge, I just didn't think it was an intelligent thing to do when you're alone."
120,2017-06-03,['hiking'],Very nice trail that has many bridges crossing the small creek. Beautiful small stream run alongside. The waterfall near the end is awesome.
121,2017-05-30,[''],"was nice and cool great for kids would never take my dog and tra il since there are a lot of people  going up and down the trail and it is na
rrow and several places. wish trial was wider"
122,2017-05-25,[''],Pretty hike. North trailhead is sunny and steeper. South trailhead follows the stream and is shaded. Very green in May. Steep rocky dirt road to get to the trailheads. Kind of hard to find actual trailheads.
123,2017-05-07,['hiking'],"I love this trail, it's beautiful, cool, and has nice shade. the only thing I don't like about it, so many people hiking with dogs off leash. I may be wrong, but it's my understanding that we have leash laws, even on hiking trails. This wouldn't be problem if all of the dogs were properly trained to ignore passing humans and dogs, but many aren't, and they run towards fellow hikers and their dogs, creating tense situations and stress."
124,2017-05-04,['hiking'],Don't let the start of the south trail scare you! The trail levels out. I've been up here a thousand times and it never gets old. Make sure you keep pets on a leash a lot of dogs get lost up here.
125,2017-04-17,[''],There is a North side of this trail and a South side. I strongly recommend the South over the North as it is shaded. It also has easy access to water for dogs.
126,2017-03-18,[''],Good moderate hike for early spring
127,2017-03-03,[''],One of my faves!
128,2016-11-14,['hiking'],"Overall a pretty great hike. The rope swing is a cute idea. Me and my dog kept going after that. Got probably 30 minutes past that and wasn't sure how much farther it went. But the sun was beginning to set and I wasn't prepared with flash lights so we had to turn around. A moderate rated hike at the beginning (entered on the north side so it was very hot and no shade until we got into the canyon) also, getting down to the waterfall was not easy. Very muddy and my dog struggled a bit."
129,2016-10-16,[''],Rope swing is awesome. My 6 year old loved it. Short hike but steep and rocky. Take your time and see the beauty.
130,2016-09-15,[''],Loved the rope swing!
131,2016-09-06,['hiking'],Did this hike on Labor Day. There were a ton of people on the trail (as to be expected given the holiday). The rope swing was great for the kids and the south side of the trail provides a great deal of shade. Would definitely go again but on a weekday.
132,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Did the South trail in and back out after reading all of the reviews and very happy we did. Shady and the trail runs along the creek, very pretty. We continued for a mile or so after the rope swing (the kids loved that!) and ran into the waterfall. Only saw a few people our entire hike which we loved!! Not as busy as a lot of the other hikes we've done around here."
133,2016-08-26,['hiking'],"Great hike! was a little confused at first to where this hike starts since there are no signs on the road till your right in front of the actual hike. At the end of the paved road you have an option of going left or right to continue on dirt roads along with private property signs everywhere. Take your car to the right direction and follow it up taking a slight left at a fork where it loops up and back and follow till you find a small dirt parking area and and you will see a sign for Deuel creek south start, Yay!  From here the rope swing is about 45 minutes in the hike and continue another 30 mins till you reach the actual waterfall. To the the waterfall the hike was 1hr and 20 mins almost 5 miles total in and out but not quite. Very good hike, lots of tree coverage."
134,2016-08-24,['hiking'],Great hike.  We saw a tarantula and a rattle snake in the middle of the lower section of the trail.   Kinda surprised we saw them because they were hiding under a branch from a bush that was reaching out over the trail.
135,2016-08-22,['hiking'],"Loved the rope swing! Nice and shaded the entire trail, and hiking beside the stream helped keep things cool. A nice hike for a hot summer day. Tons of fresh raspberries for the picking- but we went a couple weeks ago. I get worried about the heat for my little jack Russell terrier, but he stayed cool and happy between the shaded trail and playing in the water."
136,2016-08-08,['hiking'],Made it to the water fall.  It was worth it!
137,2016-07-16,['hiking'],"Took South Trail: ideal! The rope swing was a hit, something to encourage the hikers! Not sure where the waterfall was, unless it was a tiny one that we thought may have been it. Hiked a mile past the swing but never saw another waterfall. Any ideas?"
138,2016-07-14,['hiking'],"We went up the north trail head and that was a BIG mistake. Steep, uphill all the way and no shade or water or view. We came down the south side and it was heaven- right along the water, shade the whole way and beauty. The rope swing is straight ahead about an extra mile when you come to the fork. Next time we'll start on the south side for sure!"
139,2016-07-14,['hiking'],South trail was very fun. Moderately difficult for steepness and for rocky trail portions. Shady all the way to a rope swing. About an hour and a half round trip.
140,2016-07-11,[''],"Hike might have been cool. Don't bring smaller dogs, especially to the north end. I have two Boston Terriers and they usually do really well. They crapped out before I even got to the ""good"" part of the hike. Very steep and hot."
141,2016-07-11,['hiking'],True the North entrance is hot and boring but once you get in the canyon it is beautiful! the paths are clean and well defined but I never say any signs except at the entrance ....I thought I was following the same path down but ended up exiting at the South end...so I had to walk down the gravel road to my car. Not sure where I got on the other trail. it would be nice to have some markers to know where you are on the trail. I thought the trail was rather difficult bit my dog thought it was a piece of cake!
142,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"I took my two boys (6 and 7) and we loved this trail! We started around 7:30pm on a Friday night and got back about 9:30, just as the sun was setting. It's a fantastic hike with a fun rope swing to play on. It's shaded almost the entire way with lush foliage and even some raspberry bushes along the way. Highly recommended!!"
143,2016-07-08,[''],This is definitely my new favorite trail.   stunning and not to difficult...I have emphysema and I did it.   I'll take my two dogs next time.
144,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"We packed our two children up to the mountain swing.  We started from the North Trailhead.  I'm used to steep SLC hikes, so I didn't think the North side was too bad.  South side is definitely shadier, cooler (next to the stream) and less elevation.  When we do it again we will stay on the South side."
145,2016-07-03,['hiking'],The trail was great until we ran into poison ivy and had to turn around.  No way was I taking any chances!
146,2016-06-29,['hiking'],"This was a great hike. The swing is great. Plan in some time for that. the waterfall is amazing, unlike some others, it has many trees and a great view fr the waterfall. My friend brought slang a drone a shot some great forage of the SL valley and the waterfall. This hike is a must!"
147,2016-06-24,['hiking'],"I live within a mile of this trail, so I've been quite a few times. It's a beautiful hike, and just challenging enough at times that you don't get bored but can easily manage it. My dog loves the hike, too. Haven't been to the waterfall yet, but I've gotten relatively close. I hope to very soon."
148,2016-06-24,['hiking'],
149,2016-06-20,[''],Great family hike and plenty of fun for our pup too!
150,2016-06-12,[''],"awesome trail, South trail is nice visually"
151,2016-06-05,[''],"Great hike, our four year old did well up and back."
152,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"Went up the north side and back down the south side Memorial Day, north side is definitely less crowded and steeper. One of my favorite hikes in the area."
153,2016-05-22,['hiking'],Deuel is a beautiful and rugged canyon. I've seen bear scat and large cat tracks at surprisingly low elevations. Be on the look out for rattlesnakes sunning themselves in the middle of the path.
154,2016-05-16,[''],Awsome!!!
155,2016-05-15,['hiking'],Great moderate trial. Took all four kids 4-12. Perfect difficulty for all. Great loop.
156,2016-05-10,[''],"I'm kind of surprised by the reviews saying it was family friendly. The hike was quite steep and technical at parts, though it didn't last very long. Beautiful hike right along the water most of the way. Nice short day hike."
157,2016-05-01,['hiking'],"This is an amazing trail with great views, and it is mostly shaded on the south part. The rope swing just tops it off as a great hike."
158,2016-05-01,['hiking'],This a great family hike. We hiked up past the documented trail (on this app) hoping to get to the waterfall but didn't make it. For the most part the trail undulates making the climb easy from my perspective. It is well covered by trees and follows the creek the whole way. To make the hike more interesting their are several points of interest along the way. We brought our 2 dogs with us and they also had a great time. We'll definitely do this one again in hopes of reaching the waterfall.
159,2016-05-01,[''],Absolutely beautiful. The hike along the water and above the waterfall is breathtaking. The traverse down the north end of the loop is a little tricky for young children. One of my favorites!
160,2016-04-29,['hiking'],really fun and beautiful trail. I hiked up on the south side and down on the north side. it was wonderful. Will go again.
161,2016-03-01,['hiking'],"My 8 year old daughter and I really enjoyed this hike!  Conditions were surprisingly good for the end of February.  We hiked in on the south side which proved to be fairly easy going.  There are a couple of spots where the trail has worn away due to the weather and melting snow but nothing too treacherous.  This trail is fairly kid friendly down to about 4 or 5 years old with close parent supervision.  I imagine during run off the stream could be fairly quick and dangerous.  There are 4 or 5 small bridge crossings on the way up to the rope swing which is roughly 1/2 mile past the north/south trail intersection.  Though the trail was covered with snow, it was hard packed and fairly easy to orienteer with just hiking boots.  We will definitely return in the spring and summer to enjoy this trail through the seasons.  There weren't many people on the trail but it is February so I'm sure it gets more active in the warmer months.  Overall, one of our favorite local jaunts!!"
162,2016-01-01,[''],I really enjoy this trail in the winter. I take the South side of the trail which follows the stream. It's very pleasant and not too difficult.
163,2015-11-01,['hiking'],"Love this trail. I don't recommend driving to South trailhead unless you have 4 wheel drive. The parking lot and road have several deep ruts and I thought my car was going to get stuck. The start of the trail is also eroded in 2 places so I would not take take young children. The trail is frequently narrow. The farther you go, the log bridges start to deteriorate. Made it to the waterfall which is beyond the trail map. My goal is to get to the end of Deuel Creek or as far as the trail goes."
164,2015-06-09,[''],"good trail. I start at the north trail head and just go straight up and back, I don't bother with the loop. I like to run it, because the river keeps it a little cooler, and lots of cover from direct sunlight. my dog loves this trail too. people say lightly traveled. I don't really agree, I see plenty of people every time I'm up there.

**caution** lots of poison ivy along the trail. teach your kids what it is so they don't trapse through it."
165,2015-06-01,['hiking'],We started at the north end of the trail which is steep and has little shade and ended at the south end parking lot. The north side is more challenging but once that is completed you get to enjoy the south side's beauty and ease.  At the top of the trail there is a great view of the valley and there is even a rock bench that has been created. Great trail overall.
166,2015-02-05,['hiking'],Favorite place! It is close to where I live so this has become my gym.
167,2014-06-22,['hiking'],"Gorgeous, sparsely traveled, not too strenuous, very dog friendly. I parked on 100 South, started on the north side of the canyon and looped around to finish on the south side. If you do go this way, the first bit is steep with no cover, but for most of the hike you follow the creek and there's plenty of shade. You can drive up further and park right near the south side trail head, but either way there's a tiny walk to get back to your car. There were lots of awesome campsites along the way. Also, I do think this difficulty rating was a bit high. I would not rate it at anything higher than ""difficult (one black diamond)"", but that's just me."
168,2014-05-25,['hiking'],"Quiet, peaceful, and beautiful. Start is a little hot and steep with little cover. Once close to the creek, well worth it. Not too many on the trail. -Memorial weekend, Sunday. Great trail and workout."
169,2014-02-28,['hiking'],This was a very fun hike! A little steep at the beginning (on the north side) but not bad at all after that. My 5 and 4 year old did just fin on it and loved exploring all the campsites. We will be returning for an overnighter. I can't believe we were able to do this whole hike in February!
170,2014-01-26,['hiking'],"Great hike for my hubby, dog, and I.  Definitely can get a little steep on the north side, but fun to follow the creek up and play on the rope swing!"
171,2014-01-03,['hiking'],Been up this trail many many times. Every season brings a unique beauty. Waterfalls and rock walls really add to the trail. It is well kept. Ran across a moose this summer and a rattlesnake for the first time. The snake was at the beginning of the trail. All in all a fantastic trail!
172,2013-04-28,['hiking'],Great hike. We love the rope swing!
173,2013-04-24,['hiking'],Loved the rope swing. I plan on going back and staying for a night soon. There are several nice camp sites near the end.  The north route can get pretty hot during the day and is mostly all up hill.    
174,2012-08-18,['hiking'],Absolutely loved this hike. The North Creek side was strenuous but coming back on the South side was good and it took u by a decent water slide. The rope swing was awesome for my daughter. Keep your babies close as some of the hike is over rock and there are plenty of steep hills to slide down. I intend on doing this one again.
