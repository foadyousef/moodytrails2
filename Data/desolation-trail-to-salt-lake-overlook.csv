0,2019-09-06,['hiking'],This is a good trail for a morning hike. There are some mild rocky parts that require you to climb over but nothing the average person can't handle. There are beautiful views all the way up! I went with my dog and he absolutely loved it up there. 
1,2019-09-05,['hiking'],Nice shaded hike on switchbacks with a great (but limited) view of SLC.
2,2019-09-04,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
3,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"This trail has a steady incline pretty much the whole way to the overlook, but never very steep. It was an even day, but even then more than half the dogs were off leash. Fortunately, we didn't encounter any doggie deposits so their owners are doing a great job keeping the trail clean. Pretty heavy traffic today with the holiday, but a great hike."
4,2019-09-02,['hiking'],This is an excellent summer evening hike because of how shaded it is and the great view of the sunset over Salt Lake valley. We started our hike at 6:45 And made it to the top for the 8:00 sunset. Just be sure to have a flashlight for the way back down. 
5,2019-09-01,['hiking'],Visiting with my pups yesterday. It was an odd day so able to have them off leash. Constant climb to top. It’s doable although I did stop once or twice to catch my breath. Majority of trail is shaded but when you are exposed it’s HOT. Started about 8:30 am. Majority of people out have dogs since dogs are allowed. Take plenty of water for yourself AND dogs. Trail ends at the view. Some other hikers told me it continued (there is a trail that keeps going) and I followed it until I checked this app and realized it put you on another trail so I turned around. Parking was easy. There’s a river right beside the overflow lot so I let the dogs cool off in it after the hike. Recommend. Nice views of the city. 
6,2019-08-30,['hiking'],This is a very mellow trail! Super beautiful forest walks. It's also great for snowshoeing.
7,2019-08-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Pretty nice trail but pretty rocky, lots of tree cover."
8,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Beautiful alpine hike. Pretty steep but not extreme with a few slight climbs. Relatively shaded, maybe 50% of the time.

Dogs allowed off leash on odd numbered days, must be on leash an even number days. Very popular dog path!"
9,2019-08-24,['trail running'],this has always been a fun trail run. bring water for your dogs 
10,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"Went hiking here the other day. Nice hike, about 5 miles total. Great views at the top. We weren’t sure we had reached the top, so we walked a little further and turned back around. Definitely recommend bringing A LOT of water - both for you and the dog. "
11,2019-08-22,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",This is a very good trail to go up especially in the early morning. I’d say about 80-90% of the trial is shady and the incline isn’t too bad. There are some small sections where it’s very rocky and you have to climb up the rocks but it’s nothing too difficult. The dog really enjoyed it as well.
12,2019-08-19,['hiking'],good 1.5-2 hour round trip sans kids. dog is exhausted. hearty kids could do this one. mine might if they have friends with. 
13,2019-08-16,['hiking'],"Great trail with only some technical areas I would call difficult but mostly a nice, well-groomed trail. Intermittent sun and shade but plenty of shade. Started at 1:00 and done at 4:30 including lunch at the overlook. One of my favorite hikes."
14,2019-08-16,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
15,2019-08-11,['hiking'],nice for beginners
16,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"Beautiful day, if a little hot. Encountered a few people going and and down but had the trail to ourselves 99% of the time. Although the trail itself isn’t the most scenic I’ve been on, it’s peaceful, and the overlook at the top is stunning. There are 2 trail signs along the way; at each one head to the right. The lower part of the trail is easier. Once you pass the 2nd sign things get a little more fun and challenging (for me). The gradient is low, but it’s a consistent incline to the top. Great workout. "
17,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"Great trail. It was definitely on the easier side as I’m only a beginner hiker, but I am in decent shape outside of hiking. It’s mostly shaded which is nice and it’s dog friendly, which is a huge plus for me. The view at the top was nice. Even on a midday Saturday hike during early August, it wasn’t overly crowded and not too hot either but could get a bit it in the short spots where it wasn’t shaded so bring water. If I didn’t want to check out as many hikes as I can while in Utah for a year, I’d certainly consider doing this one again - maybe even for a run or with my dog!"
18,2019-08-05,['trail running'],Such a perfect trail for trail running. And what a great view at the top. One of my new favorites.
19,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"I would consider this more easy than intermediate, as am I a beginner and I felt just fine. Ended up looping it TWICE by ACCIDENT because I didn’t expect it to be so short! When I descended the switchbacks I assumed the sign pointing upward was a continuance of the trail, when really it was the trailhead and I didn’t even realize it! So I went back up and around! My small, elderly pup lead the way and she did just fine as it it mostly shaded. Don’t expect a grand ending — I was a little disappointed when I realized the trail ended where it did, thus why I’ve given it 4 stars. Otherwise it was fun and easy. "
20,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Well used trail but passed minimal people/dogs starting out at 5:00 pm on Saturday.  Didn’t see any dog poop/bags on the trail. Walking stick was definitely helpful. Initially missed (signed) turn from Thaynes Trail up small chute  of rocks to continue on Desolation path.
21,2019-07-26,['hiking'],loved this trail. took my two dogs and they loved it too. it was a little strenuous but the perfect amount. got a good sweat on and the view at the end was worth it.  please take your dogs poop bags out with you. many people leaving them along the trail. be responsible. all in all a great hike that I would recommend for any age. 
22,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
23,2019-07-20,['hiking'],This is a well maintained trail but it pretty exposed in some areas in the middle of the day.. I suggest for early mornings or later in the day. Small workout with a reward. 
24,2019-07-19,['hiking'],"Went in the evening so we saw the sunset at ther top, and the trail was in shade the entire time. I highly recommend that. However, the sign at trailhead says it's only 2 miles to the overlook, but it's definitely more, which mattered because this actually became a hard hike for me. There are alotalotalotalot of switchbacks made of intermittent steep and nearly flat sections, but the higher I went, the steeper and rockier it became. I found myself wishing I'd remembered my trekking poles. Still, it truly is a great payoff at the top. "
25,2019-07-18,['hiking'],This is an easy hike with a really nice view at the end. We missed one switchback where the trail appears to continue straight on. This trail soon became a bushwhack so we doubled back and found the turn we missed. The right trail is well maintained all the way.
26,2019-07-18,['hiking'],Hiked July 16 at 12pm. The parking lot was almost empty mid-day mid-week mid-July. I had tried doing this hike several times in the winter but had always turned around before getting to the overlook so I was determined to get it done. Even for a hot day (100 degrees in the valley) it wasn’t too bad and had shade about 75% of the hike. I’d consider myself an intermediate hiker and I reached the overlook in a little over an hour. My watch said 2.3 miles to the top. It was a great workout! 
27,2019-07-17,['hiking'],Trail is mostly smooth. There are a few rocks and roots at the turns. Mostly shady. Nice view at the top. 
28,2019-07-09,"['hiking', 'rocky']","The hike was fairly easy, not as steep as i expected. Thankfully no encounters with any snakes. I had my dog off leash and she loved it. No waterways on the trail so be sure to bring plenty of water for you and the dogs. Nicely shaded at parts. I was looking done most of the time since the trail is covered in rocks and tree roots. "
29,2019-07-06,['hiking'],Nice hike with a lot of shade. Highly recommend it. 
30,2019-07-06,['hiking'],Great hike. My 7 & 9 year old loved it. A lot of cover from trees along hike. Loved seeing people’s dogs on the hike. But wish some of them did a better job of picking up their poo. Not very crowded especially for 4th July weekend. Salt lake overlook very beautiful. Good signs letting you know you  are on the right path. 
31,2019-06-30,['hiking'],This is one of my favorites. Beautiful and quiet in the mornings. Still plenty of flowers and the mountain sides are lush with greenery. 
32,2019-06-28,['hiking'],"We were in Salt Lake City on a cross country trip with our dog and this hike was recommended by a friend. It wasn't an extremely difficult hike, but definitely a workout. We're also coming from sea level in San Diego though. We came on an odd numbered day, so our dog loved being off leash and being able to run around and meet other people and dogs. The view at the top was awesome, and the wind felt great. There are also some cool rock formations for some photo opportunities. The hike back was ten times easier, obviously, and our total trip was about two and a half hours. "
33,2019-06-25,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","DOG OWNERS-PICK UP YOUR DOG'S WASTE AND STOP LEAVING IT ALONG THE TRAIL IN PLASTIC BAGGIES!! That is SO rude and disrespectful to the trail and other hikers. I saw at least 6 baggies of dog waste along the trail. NOT COOL. 
"
34,2019-06-25,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","Hiked June 24 and started around 2:30. Loved the scenery and flora, but that came with the price of bugs everywhere. Make sure you wear bug spray, I did and still have a few bites! I did have to keep my eyes on the ground for majority of the time but there are plenty of little spots to stop for a second and enjoy the canyon you're in. I loved the overlook and can't believe how much you could see from up there! On my way down around 4:30 I saw over 10 people vs. my roughly 5 on the way up. "
35,2019-06-25,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","This is one of my favorite trails at Millcreek. Steady climb is definitely a great leg workout. Great views but I found myself looking down bc of rocks and tree trunks mostly. Actually twisted my ankle today and no one around to help, so watch the ground!! Not too much sun but lots of bugs swarming around this time of year. There is a restroom at the base of trail. "
36,2019-06-23,['trail running'],"I loved this trail, you get a fantastic view, even on the way up. Aside from a few areas with large rocks, you can run it the whole time, no problem, and the forest is beautiful right now!! "
37,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'bugs']",it's not lightly trafficked. we saw 20 people on a 5 mile hike. the view is great at the overlook. definitely worth it. 
38,2019-06-20,"['hiking', 'scramble']",
39,2019-06-17,['hiking'],"Wildflowers are out! Pretty shaded hike most of the way, great hike to see some of the city without hearing highway traffic. Took 2.5 hours"
40,2019-06-15,['hiking'],"This trail had some great views. I really enjoyed the multiple vantage points along the way. I did encounter 2 rattlesnakes. The first crossed the path along a sunny rock formation on the trail, and the second was under a tree just off the trail. It was around 70° F, and I went on 6/11/2019. If you are not used to the elevation, it will pose a different level of challenge in itself. Overall, worth the hike!"
41,2019-06-12,['hiking'],"I love this trail year round. This morning, I saw one snake and heard rattles two separate times in the sunny spots, so stay alert and be careful with your dogs. We walked down Thayne’s Canyon to stay in the shade after the snake encounters. The temperature was cool and refreshing in there. "
42,2019-06-10,['hiking'],"Very mild incline hike with dog friendly. We enjoyed it very much. Not for small kids friendly, for the distance wise, and how small area it is at the top. But entire trail was lovely with beautiful nature, wild flowers and a few wildlife. It was sunny but high 58 when we hiked so we were glad that we carried our long sleeves.  Not muddy at all (6/9/2019). Parking could be challenging when you go mid day. "
43,2019-06-10,['hiking'],"Nice moderate trail, mostly shaded, nice forest view going up. The view is nice at the top, fun hike!"
44,2019-06-09,[''],"Nice trail! Not too steep but gets you to a decent altitude. Nice combination of shade and forest shadow. But terribly overcrowded, I think I met 200 people. it took less than 90 min to get to the city overlook but I kept going to find a spot that was not too crowded. I started shortly after 9 am on a Sunday and it felt loke Grand Central Station. "
45,2019-06-08,"['bugs', 'rocky']","Trail is a steady incline trail with fair amounts of both tree cover and bush. Was surprised by how nice the trail was. The peak itself was a little ""meh"" but good experience overall. Flies were terrible though."
46,2019-06-06,['hiking'],"Trail is in great shape and the wildflowers are blooming. Couple of open sunny segments, but mostly shade to part-shade. "
47,2019-06-04,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'scramble']",
48,2019-06-03,['hiking'],"We did the trail 6/1/19. The trail was clear and free from any snow. I’m an older lady not at all used to hiking, being from south Louisiana, and I was able to do the trail. It was a little strenuous but we just took our time and made it to the top. The view was awesome. Well worth the struggle. They had a few rock switch backs but we just took it slow. Good hike."
49,2019-05-31,['hiking'],Trail is perfect right now - barely mud and well cleared
50,2019-05-25,['hiking'],
51,2019-05-17,['hiking'],"Was in SLC for biz and had a free afternoon. Perfect hike for the time I had. Took 2 hrs round trip, not crowded, and pretty views at the top. Gradual incline the entire hike. Is accurately rated as moderate."
52,2019-05-16,['hiking'],"I love this trail. Good steady incline but you don’t feel like you’re dying. Great at sunset. But bring a flashlight going down if you leave after 8:30.  
Good date hike"
53,2019-05-15,['hiking'],Pretty hike! Gradual incline with a few small patches of snow. Great views from the top. Relatively crowded. Large parts are unshaded so it gets hot. Lots of small bugs. Bring bug spray. Fee to hike in Millcreek Canyon is $3. 
54,2019-05-12,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Hiked this trail for the first time yesterday evening. 2.7 miles up to the overlook. Some snowy patches but regular tennis shoes were fine taking them slow. Beautiful temperatures and beautiful views! This trail had a nice mix of shade and sun. I definitely will do this trail again
55,2019-05-12,['hiking'],There was a bit of snow in places still but nothing that couldn’t be done in regular shoes. A beautiful trail!
56,2019-05-06,['hiking'],"I would highly recommend this trail to anyone who wants to hike with their dog and would like to experience the nice views of the Salt Lake Valley. I hiked on May 3rd, couple of spots have still ice and snow. So be careful. Other than that it was a moderately difficult trail..."
57,2019-05-06,['hiking'],Awesome trail and hike. Took our dog with us on an off leash Sunday and she had a blast. Trail wasn't too busy. Beautiful views once you reach the top. Plenty areas of shade on the way.
58,2019-05-05,['hiking'],"Great way to spend cinco de mayo! Started at 9:45 AM, took 48 minutes to get to the overlook, enjoyed the gorgeous scene at the overlook, and was back at the car by 11:30 AM. 

Moderately trafficked. Dog friendly. Dogs can be off leash on odd days like today since it's May 5th. 
Trail was mostly dry. 4 sections with compacted snow.  1 of the 4 was an icy switch back. Another icy section slightly tilted downhill and was somewhat turning slushy with the sun out, but you can still find sure footing. You don't need spikes. Poles could be helpful for some.
Saw a moose! No wild flowers yet. Highly recommend."
59,2019-05-05,['hiking'],"Amazing hike!  Only two snow patches left on the very last switch back..... no spikes needed.  Also, we did this as a night hike and there was a very calm extremely large moose sitting and eating on the trail on our way down.  She was very content as took up the whole trail.   We had to climb up through the sage brush around her!  So that was fun....."
60,2019-05-04,['hiking'],Ran into a bull moose 5’ off the trail.  Be aware of your surroundings and practice safe wildlife etiquette.
61,2019-04-27,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Some parts of the trail still has snow patches near the top. Well worth the trek! It’s a nice hike to the overlook. It was initially hard to find the trailhead. Trail head is about a mile pass the pipeline trail. No cell service.
62,2019-04-18,[''],"there were some stretches of dirt, but still mostly ice and snow. Spikes maybe not 100% necessary, but I was glad I had mine. it was nice because it wasn't too muddy."
63,2019-04-06,['hiking'],Great hike.  Just completed it with my daughter.  But do not even attempt without spikes and poles.  Snow and ice from top to bottom.
64,2019-04-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Hiked 4/5 and there is snow all the way up. Spikes recommended! Also a few downed trees (one big one) you will need to skirt around near where Thanes and Deso split. USFS was heading out but not sure if they will be able to clear until their Spring crew starts up.
65,2019-04-05,['hiking'],Great hike with beautiful views! I went today (4/4) early afternoon and by then the snow was really slushy/slippery so watch your step! Definitely recommend boots and spikes
66,2019-03-09,"['hiking', 'snow']","This hike was pretty easy all things considered! The snow was packed down the entire way, but it wasn't too icy. If you stepped off the trail, there were parts where your boot would go down to about knee deep, as that area was more light snow. We did the hike in Yak Trax. However, I think it could have been done without. Tennis shoes would be hard. But standard hiking boots could have been doable. Yak Trax just made it extra easy. The view was AMAZING the day we went. It was about 34 degrees on the way up and I was comfortable in a dry fit long sleeve + light quarter zip (and hat/mittens). Got a little cold on the top when there was wind, but not terrible. This hike is so different in the winter, and I loved all of it. Highly recommend!!"
67,2019-02-24,[''],very pretty views all the time
68,2019-02-21,['hiking'],"Great winter hike, it’s too slick to do without some kind of yak-track but it’s good and fairly easy. Great for the whole crew."
69,2019-02-20,[''],"Fun trail to take the pup out on. Unless you hike the day or 2 after a snow storm, micro spikes are usually sufficient."
70,2019-02-17,['hiking'],Just needed microspikes. Well packed. Loved this hike and the view from the overlook is amazing! Will definitely do again
71,2019-02-17,['hiking'],"Love to do this one hiking/snowshoeing in winter. Very doable and a great workout. When you get to the overlook in a clear day, you can see the entire Salt Lake valley, downtown and the Great Salt Lake. Lots of people bring their dogs along."
72,2019-02-01,"['hiking', 'snow']",
73,2019-01-28,[''],"Went up Friday 25th, perfect trail snow pack conditions. Yacktrax recommended."
74,2018-12-30,['hiking'],"You need micro spikes as the trail was completely snow covered. I don’t think the view is as good, as the hike up the pipeline trail to the salt lake over look, but it’s still pretty"
75,2018-12-29,['hiking'],Microspikes are your friend for this trail.
76,2018-12-28,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike in the snow at night with headlamps. Only needed microspikes as the snow was packed down on the trail, despite deep snow on the sides of the trail."
77,2018-12-14,['hiking'],Great trail. First time doing this one and the view from the top is gorgeous. No need for snowshoes or spikes on this day. Trails are a little narrow with some steep drop offs on some parts. Views on the trail are gorgeous too.
78,2018-12-11,['hiking'],Great trail. It's well-worn in the snow and you should only need microspikes unless you're going up right after a storm. Wonderful views of the canyon and valley all in one hike.
79,2018-10-26,['hiking'],"no snow, ice, or even mud as of 10/25. gorgeous sunset. need a headlamp this time of year if going after work."
80,2018-10-17,[''],"Snow and slippery conditions after about 1.2 miles up. Microspikes recommended. Mucky mud too, but it was only really bad in a couple of spots. Winter is coming! Still a great hike, lovely view of the pines topped with snow much of the way up. Walking slower since I didn't have spikes, it took me 2 hours up and 1 hour down with a short break at the overlook. Also, it actually just under 5 miles round trip, not 4.1 miles from the description."
81,2018-10-14,[''],"Super fun 
Great work out with family"
82,2018-10-07,['hiking'],Great hike! Nice elevation so it’s just enough of a little workout. Amazing view at the end!
83,2018-09-30,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful with the fall colors.
84,2018-09-21,['hiking'],Great hike especially at night with flashlights.
85,2018-09-19,['hiking'],"This trail has a lot of shade, and although it gains a lot of altitude, the switchbacks are long and fairly gentle.  There are some parts where you have to scramble up rocks, and it is a narrow trail.  We started at 10am on a Tuesday morning, and it wasn’t very crowded.  It took us until 1:15pm to make it to the first view of the Valley.  We stopped there because we were in a bit of a time crunch.  We didn’t make it back down until 3pm!  The person who mentioned making it up in 40 minutes deserves a slow clap.  My middle two have autism and hike slowly and need lots of breaks.  They loved the trail but did feel like it was quite long.  In general kids aren’t super pumped about hiking to an overlook, but if you’re trying to decided between this hike and Rattlesnake Gulch up Millcreek Canyon, I’d say Rattlesnake is better—shorter and better view, though it does feel steeper.  P.S. The leaves are changing like crazy, but it’s in a dry, crispy sort of way.  Still pretty though."
86,2018-09-15,[''],Good trail!  You can either go for some time or a quick trail run!
87,2018-09-06,[''],Trail is one of my faves. good starter trail for those who haven't hiked much. Did it today 40 min up and 34 down.
88,2018-08-27,[''],An enjoyable hike with a beautiful but limited view. Great for dogs.
89,2018-08-24,[''],Nice hike for a group ranging from 8 to 70. Rain the previous night kept the dust down. Hazy due to smoke.
90,2018-08-19,[''],Love the hike.  Fantastic view and kid friendly.
91,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"This is PERFECT for a quick hike or a run. The loop is about 2 miles, steeper to go up on the left side, and then coming back down the other side has nice smooth switch backs. I ran the loop twice and it’s nearly entirely in the shade. Not too trafficked either -It was actually very quiet and peaceful. There is a $3 fee for Millcreek canyon, but it’s worth it."
92,2018-08-17,['hiking'],"This was our 3rd hike since moving to Salt Lake City.  I would highly recommend this trail if you are a moderate hiker.  The topography was my favorite so far.  The tall trees cover most of the hike and you constantly have beautiful views of the surrounding mountains.  It isn’t too intense for anyone and the view of the city is amazing once your up there.
#topofthemountain"
93,2018-08-17,['hiking'],"This was pretty good. Well maintained trail with only a few rocky sections. The view at the top was great, but difficult to enjoy due to bugs and lack of sitting places."
94,2018-08-16,[''],"The actual mileage is 5.2, but its super relaxing; gets a little crowded so I would make sure to start by 0700. The scenic overlook is good, but not as good as Living Room (though the hike is better).

A lot of doggos. So many good boys."
95,2018-08-15,['hiking'],Amazing quick hike with a terrific view. Would like to explore this area more.
96,2018-08-11,['hiking'],"Great out and back with fantastic views of SLC. Really green, even in late summer. If you’re a birder, great high elevation coniferous forest is likely great in the morning. With only ~1000ft elevation gain, going up isn’t difficult and switchbacks aren’t bad. About 65% of the trail is shaded which is great. We hiked this mid-day in August, sunny spots were hot, but plenty of shade. Every group we ran into that afternoon was all women, get it ladies!! Not in any rush, this took us about 2.5hrs. Do be aware that there is a $3/car area use fee on the way out"
97,2018-08-05,['hiking'],Went on a Sunday morning around 9:30 and there were a handful of groups so I felt like I had the place largely to myself. Several stretches suitable for running back. Right now it was pretty smoky :(
98,2018-08-04,['hiking'],
99,2018-07-30,['hiking'],"Plenty of shade, good views, it doesn’t cross any rivers or streams and that’s a good thing sometimes. I’ll be back to enjoy this short hike again sometime."
100,2018-07-30,['hiking'],Great trail. Went up to Thayne peak. Pretty steep the last 300m. But what a view. Worth the extra effort.
101,2018-07-28,[''],"Busy trail, very shaded. I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Awesome view at the top."
102,2018-07-28,[''],7/22 - Pretty busy (but went on Founders Day). Hot but was about 50% shaded. A decent view for the effort exerted.
103,2018-07-23,[''],great time with kids. A little longer than at haff thought but pretty scenery .
104,2018-07-21,[''],Great hike with a mostly shaded trail. Tons of switch backs with gradual elevation gain. My Strava shows this as 4.8 miles RT. Pretty views along the way and a great view of the valley at the top.
105,2018-07-19,['hiking'],Favorite hike on mid days. shady and fun. did see a rattlesnake about mid way.l
106,2018-07-18,['hiking'],Lots of switchbacks!! But overall fun trail with the pup!
107,2018-07-17,['hiking'],
108,2018-07-10,['hiking'],Beautiful and well maintained trail with many wildflowers. There is a small creek near parts of the trail but at very few points can you actually see it. There is some shade but plan carefully to go at a good time because there are steep points where there is no cover. The lake is pretty but small. There were TONS of flies so I’d suggest bringing bug spray which works specifically against all flies and worry less about mosquitoes. Also keep an eye out for moose.
109,2018-07-06,['hiking'],"This is a shaded hike so it's good for those hot mid-day hikes. The trail is wooded and the overlook was lovely. However, my Fitbit logged us at almost 6 mi up and back, not 4. Took about 3 hours, but I had to sit down a couple of times because I ran out of steam."
110,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail last fall.  Great trail to take in some colors.  It is steeper than I expected, but the trails are smooth and easy to fallow."
111,2018-06-29,['hiking'],Great hike on a well maintained trail. Did this hike to catch the sunset and it did not disappoint. Our dog loved it too. 2 hours round trip.
112,2018-06-28,['hiking'],Always a favorite. Took my 8 month old and he did great. Plan on passing lots of hikers and trail runners. Kid friendly and dog friendly. Fee in Millcreek Canyon ($3) to get to trailhead.
113,2018-06-26,['hiking'],Great hike this morning!!! The dogs and I had breakfast at the top. Got the hike in before work this morning. Great way to start our day. A little over 2 hours up and back but only because my Dalmatian decided to do a walk about and I had to track her down 
114,2018-06-24,[''],"This has become my new favorite. Stunning greenery. Great trail. Amazing and rewarding view from top. 

Not difficult at all. My dog loved it. I loved it. Two hours up and back. Zero mosquitoes. Seriously. Incredible. Odds are I will be taking many dates on this hike from now on lol"
115,2018-06-22,[''],Great hike!   Beautiful view from the top!
116,2018-06-12,[''],"nice hike, nice views. A little busy but not bad."
117,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"Relatively easy hike. We were being swarmed by flies for the whole way up, and half way back down, which is why I docked 2 stars. They made it miserable."
118,2018-06-09,[''],"Great hike. It was a little crowded for a trail called ""Desolation."" J/K. I went in the evening, and lots of people where hiking/trail running with their dogs. The view from the top is awesome. I think it would be a good sunrise hike.

FYI, if you're not from the area (like me), there is a fee for driving up Millcreek Canyon Rd."
119,2018-06-04,['hiking'],SO BEAUTIFUL. Good hike. Lots of shade.
120,2018-06-01,[''],A nice moderate trail. Hiked it. today in cool. weather for an enjoyable morning
121,2018-05-31,[''],"One of my favorite trails now! Hiked up to the overlook in 38 minutes, took in the view, then headed on up to the top of Neffs Canyon and turned around and back down the Thaynes Canyon trail, making a sort of loop. Up towards the top there were several stretches with deep snow still covering by the trail, so I was post-holing for a while. Fun hike."
122,2018-05-28,['hiking'],"Great trail total was 4.1 miles and round trip took 2 hours and 47 mins. Rain and sun both occurred as a low was swirling around.   Not too many hikers,  I'd say we passed 35 people on the trail total.  incredible views at many spots along the way up of the canyon and the overview at the top was beautiful!"
123,2018-05-27,[''],Great late afternoon trail as it is mostly shaded. Be careful with dogs off leash rattle snakes have been seen a lot lately.
124,2018-05-26,[''],Rattlesnake alert! Hiked the trail yesterday. We were eating our lunch on the first pile of rocks you get to at the top when a rattlesnake cruised right over to us. We hopped up and out of it's way. It turned and went back into the rocks toward the right as you're looking at them. Saw the rattle but it did not alert us. Dog owners beware. I've previously only seen them at the bottom of trail. Great first hike of the season as always.
125,2018-05-26,[''],"Nice hike, but it’s about 5.7 miles round trip, not 4. Good challenging hike for families. Kid and dog friendly.  A little cumbersome at the overlook."
126,2018-05-20,['hiking'],"I love this hike with my little doxie, we head up this trail multiple times a year and he’s always really happy to go the whole way. It airs on the side of easy-to moderate, especially when the temps are still under 80 degrees. 
I actually did continue on to  the Thayne canyon loop today, and I don’t recommend it. I loved the hike all the way up to the part where desolation connects with Thayne’s, but the Thayne trail is miserable, muddy, (still a bit of snow on it May 20th) and pretty ugly if you ask me. I’d much rather head back the way I came and get to hike down the SL overlook again. 
As far as hikes go, this one is great and not crowded once you pass the overlook, and even up until the overlook there aren’t too many people. Maybe a dozen other hikers and a lot of doggos. 
One of my favorites as long as you stay off the Thayne canyon portion. I’m hoping to make it to desolation lake later in the summer."
127,2018-05-20,['hiking'],"Went mid-April, still a little snowy from last weekend but watch your footing and you'll be just fine :) Go around early morning to afternoon to avoid slipping on ice!

For first time hikers, the hike up feels a lot longer than it actually is. Give yourselves about an hour (to an hour and a half) to get up, about 45 minutes to get down (unless you're taking the  Thaynes trail). Somewhat steep and winding with a few places that necessitate climbing over rocks. Would recommend griping shoes during colder weather, water bottles and snacks once you reach the top, and hiking poles to help in difficult areas.

The view is always worth it!"
128,2018-05-19,['hiking'],"I did this hike during a weeknight evening, starting just before 7PM.  The weather was gorgeous and the air crisp but not too chilly.  The trail is well-covered for a large percentage of the distance.  It starts steep with a series of short switch backs, mellows out a bit, then goes back to more switchbacks.  

You will find some rocky obstacles that are fairly simple to overcome but watch out for traffic in some of these areas as the drop off the trail is steep.  Stop a moment and take in the surrounding environment when you find yourself away from traffic as this area calls to what many of us look for in a mountain escape.

Overall the hike is very beautiful with lots of pine and spruce the whole way up.  There was some traffic going up and down but not too heavy.  The trail is accurately rated as moderate but may be on the more difficult side of that rating for some people."
129,2018-05-15,['hiking'],"What a lovely trail! Missed the turnoff to Desolation and went a ways up Thayne Canyon Trail, but followed Desolation back down. Much of the trail was in the shade, which surprised me. I’m looking forward to doing this one again!"
130,2018-05-15,['hiking'],"We just conquered this hike, on 04/29/2018 and it was gorgeous! highly recommended dry only 2 mud spots through the hole hike. Dog friendly which is a plus!"
131,2018-05-14,[''],So much fun !!!!!
132,2018-05-12,[''],I'm a short fat chick and I loved this hike. it was on the easier side of moderate. it's a mild incline with random really Rocky spots. all snow melted. took me about an hour each way. saw rattlesnack at top on rocks. lots of dogs on trail. lots of shade.
133,2018-05-11,['hiking'],"Really lovely time to go up now - no snow on the ground at all and a beautiful view. Switchbacks the whole way up. Took me about 1 1/2 hours RT. 

I started at about 7PM and thankfully didn't run into any bug problems!"
134,2018-05-08,[''],"I did this hike yesterday. It was fairly enjoyable! Good hike for solo hikers because it's very straightforward where to go. I prefer hikes with goals to get to like lakes or waterfalls, but the view was beautiful and it was pretty easy. But bring bug spray!! The bugs are ruthless and follow you everywhere. Overall pretty decent for a short hike day."
135,2018-05-06,[''],Great easy to moderate trail. Dog friendly. Awesome view. Easy parking. 130 flights to the top and around 6 miles round trip. Go early on weekends - got pretty crowded on the way back down.
136,2018-05-06,[''],Not too terribly busy for a Saturday morning (we got lucky). I hiked this trail yesterday and there was no snow on the trail.
137,2018-05-03,['walking'],Amazing view at the top!! I'm not a fan of switch backs but it was such a fun hike. It probably took us about 2hours but it was well worth it!! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a easy hike with a great view!! :)
138,2018-04-30,[''],gorgeous views at the top!
139,2018-04-30,['hiking'],I love this hike. Gradually uphill the whole way but never strenuous. I clocked 4 miles RT. All the snow has melted and the views are amazing!
140,2018-04-29,['hiking'],"110-ish minutes round trip (for me at least) 5 miles, 140 flights of stairs (according to my Fitbit).  Always a great hike - you’ll run into a lot of other hikers and dogs.  No snow left on the trail and it was mostly dry."
141,2018-04-24,[''],Hiked this trail yesterday. Absolutely stunning weather! Trail is dry with maybe four spots that still had ice. I’m sure it’s melted off by now. Beautiful overlook all the way out to The Great Salt Lake. Switchbacks make the elevation easy to handle. Highly recommend.
142,2018-04-23,[''],Love this hike! The snow has melted enough it’s in great condition.
143,2018-04-22,['hiking'],It’s a fun hike and the view at the top is definitely worth the climb up. I would definitely bring water and a few snacks. The ice was almost all melted so regular hiking boots were fine.
144,2018-04-18,['hiking'],"I'm looking to do this hike tomorrow and I am wondering what the trail is like. I've done it in the Spring before, but the weather has been so unpredictable lately."
145,2018-04-03,[''],I had my three kids with me and they loved it. it was definitely a challenge with the snow and mud so I had to carry my 4 yr old on the way back down part of the way cause she kept slipping. the trail is really narrow which made me a little nervous with the kids but overall it was a great hike and I would love to do it again.
146,2018-04-01,['hiking'],"I started the hike at 12:30pm today - the trail was everything from snowy/slushy/icy/muddy and dry (overall I think it was mostly slushy due to the warm weather we had today).  I wasn't sure whether to wear Yaktrax or not, but I decided to bring them along and I'm glad I did.  I think the extra traction helped on the icy/slushy parts on the trail.  However, I also passed numerous people who were not wearing spikes, and they seemed to be fine.  The trail is both shady and sunny.  I had on a long-sleeved shirt and pants and I was fine.  Great hike, great view!"
147,2018-03-31,['hiking'],Great hike!  There’s still snow so there’s some slick spots.  Beautiful view!
148,2018-03-21,[''],"Really lovely hike. Went mid-March and it was still pretty snowy, but we were able to get up without any kind of specific hiking gear. If you do go near the winter, I would recommend gripping shoes, though. The view at the top is very nice."
149,2018-03-13,['hiking'],Great views! Very doable hike- plenty of switchbacks!
150,2018-01-28,[''],Awesome hike with a great views and scenery.
151,2018-01-21,['hiking'],Great pay off at the end. Need crampons/microspikes.
152,2018-01-16,[''],Took my sister who’s from NY on this trail since it’s an easy trail. The trail was mostly ice so we were micro spikes the whole time.
153,2017-12-29,['hiking'],"Did this hike 12/28/17. The entire trail was packed snow with some icy spots. Trail crampons or microspikes highly recommended although I did see one person without it. Ran into about a dozen people so a fairly busy trail, even on a weekday. 
Highly recommend this hike, it can be ""easy"" if done at as slower pace since it's a small incline but if you keep a good pace it is definitely moderate. Great view at the end."
154,2017-12-04,['hiking'],
155,2017-11-27,['hiking'],"The trail is fairly narrow majority of the way and is heavily trafficked by families, dogs, etc so be aware that a lot of the hikers are not familiar with narrow trail etiquette and may annoy you. Its the price you pay for hiking a popular trail that anybody can do.

No need to bring supplies or ropes or anything. Water and some snacks and definitely a camera for when you reach the top but other than that its a moderate 2-3 hour excursion depending on how fast you move and how many people are on the trail. Don't expect cell service in the parking lot or along the trail until you get to the top, but don't worry, you're going hiking, not surfing Facebook, right?"
156,2017-11-10,['hiking'],"Just want to point out to those who might not realize, dogs are allowed OFF LEASH on trails in Millcreek Canyon on ODD numbered days. 
This is a great after work hike, not too strenuous - and great to bring along the pooch!"
157,2017-11-10,[''],Amazing walk hard but not too difficult perfect amount!!
158,2017-11-05,['hiking'],"Easy hike, a lot of fun, some nice rocks"
159,2017-10-27,['hiking'],
160,2017-10-21,[''],"Decent hike but the insane amount of dogs not on leashes made the hike less than great. Several times almost got knocked down by dogs running up and down the trail in front of their owners. PSA to dog owners: The sign at the trailhead clearly says dogs need to be on a leash, and use some self awareness by keeping your dog out of others’ way."
161,2017-10-13,['hiking'],great colors. dry trail conditions. snow flurries higher up.
162,2017-10-09,[''],"Nice steady grind to the top; never too steap, with a few rocky spots! The trail is well marked and well traveled! I took my two dogs with me and they loved it!"
163,2017-10-05,['hiking'],"Desolation Trail to SL Overlook was a perfect little escape from the city. It was a bit more 'moderately' trafficked at the time we went (3:00pm) with runners, hikers, and plenty of VERY happy dogs.

164,2017-10-02,[''],Awesome views!!
165,2017-09-30,[''],Super pretty!
166,2017-09-25,['hiking'],Very pretty with the snowfall on Sunday. Great for trail running back down. Views were limited by the white-out snow at the top but really lovely overall.
167,2017-09-23,[''],Pretty. Fair amount of switch backing. Moderate is correct category
168,2017-09-17,['hiking'],Great hike with my pups! Enjoyed the fall colors and awesome views.
169,2017-09-08,[''],"Fun morning hike! Go early, it gets hot once you're hiking above the pine trees"
170,2017-09-04,['hiking'],"Hike was a bit challenging for me towards uphill. View at the top is spectacular. Make sure to pack sufficient amount of water. My iPhone recorded as 5 mile as overall hike, not sure why my All Trails recording still shows 4.4 mile. Overall hike was challenging and very good."
171,2017-08-27,[''],"Did this hike yesterday and we all thought it was challenging but a great workout.   My Apple Watch says it was 2.56 miles trailhead to overlook and it took the four of us 56 minutes to the overlook with a few water stops along the way.  Our pace was 21 minute miles and our hearts were pumping. I think it's a bit longer than the 2.2 miles listed.  
Beautiful views of SLC at the top."
172,2017-08-27,['hiking'],
173,2017-08-26,[''],A few challenging sections but the view from the overlook is definitely worth the effort!
174,2017-08-13,['hiking'],"Did a sunset hike here, less than 2 hours total with a long beer break at the top. The efflorescence is gorgeous and it isnt too difficult, but enough to get the heart racing. Perfect for a 7 pm hike!!"
175,2017-08-12,['hiking'],
176,2017-08-12,['hiking'],"Great hike for sunset! I recommend bringing headlamps and water. We came across a couple that had neither and we had to help them down the trail. Preparation is key, especially when you hike a winding trail at night."
177,2017-08-07,['hiking'],"This is a wonderful trail if you want to get your heart pumping and receive a big payoff in a short amount of time. The beginning of the trail gets very icy in winter, so microspikes are a must. the switchbacks that meander through the woods and up this trail are lovely, and the overlook itself is a great place to sit and enjoy."
178,2017-08-06,['hiking'],Ended up in Thane Canyon on that trail from here and it is Difficult for those not in shape! But beautiful and lightly trafficked.
179,2017-08-05,[''],Great trail but definitely not lightly used. I would say this is between a moderate and heavily used trail. Perfect for a quick hike that's not too challenging.
180,2017-07-23,['hiking'],Pretty views at the top! Dog friendly although there is no river/water near the trail for the dogs so pack your own! Hot in the middle of the day with some shade throughout the trail
181,2017-07-14,['hiking'],Beautiful view of the Salt Lake valley.
182,2017-07-11,['hiking'],
183,2017-07-11,['hiking'],Nice walk with a slow and steady incline. Lots of shade. The top was beautiful. I was able to run the trail back down.
184,2017-07-04,['hiking'],A gradual climb with lots of switch-backs.  You'll have plenty of shade on a hot summer day with a spectacular view overlooking the valley.
185,2017-07-04,['trail running'],"Busy trail depending on the time of day, but I enjoy it. Nice overlook and fun for running."
186,2017-07-04,[''],"it's wonderful trail. temperature on the trail is relatively lower than outside. blue color of sky and lush green color of trees, gives lake water an awesome color combination. it's quite, serene and makes one spellbound. must go."
187,2017-07-02,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. Steady incline but not hard. Actually saw a few families with younger kids and they seemed to be doing just great. Great views at the lookout.
188,2017-06-28,['hiking'],"Fun and pretty easy hike, steady incline most the way. Great views at the end and cute dogs the whole way. The bugs are pretty bad here in the summer and there's usually not much of a breeze so definitely bring bug spray"
189,2017-06-27,[''],A little more challenging of a climb than expected but great trail!
190,2017-06-27,[''],Beautiful night hike!  Dragonflies were dancing all around us in the rocks of the overlook!
191,2017-06-25,[''],"It's a pretty trail -- but not the most beautiful year-round. It's not a strenuous hike (we passed multiple families with small children), but, if taken at a quick pace, it's a comfortable workout. Beware, though: every time I've done this hike, we've seen/been warned about rattlesnakes."
192,2017-06-24,[''],Awesome trail but minus one star because I had to pay $3 for parking. It isn't that big of a problem but I wish I knew beforehand.
193,2017-06-18,[''],Gorgeous hike with tons of trees. Beautiful overlook of the Salt Lake Valley at the top. Trail steadily climbs up the mountain and is not hard. Very enjoyable.
194,2017-06-10,['hiking'],I did this hike a couple years ago in the rain and it was spectacular! Very lush with forest and the lookout was beautiful. My son also had a lot of fun climbing around on the rocks once we reached the top.
195,2017-06-08,[''],"Great hike! Great late afternoon hike, I went around 4 pm and had shade most of the time"
196,2017-06-05,['hiking'],I would say it's heavily trafficked. Pretty much all uphill to the lookout point. Bring bug spray if you're planning on hiking it after 3pm. Nice straightforward trail pretty shady so you could do it on a hot day.
197,2017-06-04,['hiking'],"Took about an hour to get up and 40 minutes back. Steep at times, but manageable. Beautiful hike."
198,2017-06-03,[''],Awesome trail with a good blend of shade and sun exposure. Perfect for a cloudy day.
199,2017-06-02,['hiking'],Loved this trail!  Wasn't too hard of a hike and an amazing payoff at the end.  Great views with some cool rocks to hang on for pictures. Only downside was running in to an angry rattlesnake on the way back down.
200,2017-05-31,['hiking'],A nice and mellow hike with great views at the top.
201,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite short hikes! I love that I can take my dog on this trail, she loves it too! The views of the valley are absolutely breathtaking. I could spend all day on that rock looking down at the valley. It's a slight climb, but so worth it."
202,2017-05-28,['hiking'],Loved this trail. It was a moderate only because it can get a little steep so your heart rate elevates but not too hard. My dogs loved it!!
203,2017-05-28,[''],Such a fun hike! Lots of cute doggies. Our pups loved it!
204,2017-05-25,['hiking'],Really fun! Plenty of shade. Gorgeous view of the valley at the top.
205,2017-05-23,['hiking'],You can find the greatest view of sunset over the city and the Great Salt Lake from this hike.
206,2017-05-22,['hiking'],Green and lush. Perfect Sunday hike.
207,2017-05-14,['hiking'],"Hiked Desolation a couple weeks ago.  Nice ascent, some snow in shaded areas still.  The sound of rushing water was pleasant at the bottom of the trailhead and lovely views at the peak.  Definitely worth exploring!  Not for anyone with a heart condition. Had a great run down the trail too!"
208,2017-05-13,['hiking'],Hiked this for the first time today and I loved it. It's a steady uphill hike that is very manageable for beginners. Went around 4 pm and it was busy.
209,2017-05-12,['hiking'],Hiking with a baby on my back. Good conditions. No more snow. Lots of sun 11:30am-1pm
210,2017-05-10,[''],"1hour to get to the overlook. Was more shaded than I had planned for. Busy, lots of hikers had the same idea I did after work. Very beautiful and refreshing though. One of my favorites."
211,2017-05-09,['hiking'],Nice moderate trail.  Definitely doable after work before sunset.  The overlook is very cool!  A little bit of snow towards the top.
212,2017-05-07,[''],"This is my second time on the trail. There's no snow all the way up to the overlook, which is so amazingly quiet, even though it was a pretty busy location by the time we were coming down at about  11:30. It's a very popular dog trail."
213,2017-04-29,[''],Really snowy today but worth the overlook at the top!
214,2017-04-27,['hiking'],"This hike was a perfect afternoon hike. Really steady elevation gain the whole hike up. Took me about an hour up and 30 down. Pretty muddy right now with some snow at the top, but easy to hike around or on top. 
Beautiful view up top."
215,2017-04-24,[''],Good spring trail. Moderate elevation gain with level stretches to catch your breath. Not too difficult for children.
216,2017-04-23,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! The snow is almost gone. There is some snow on the trail but easily passable. Narrow trail with lots of dogs.
217,2017-04-23,['hiking'],"Perfect hike for a good afternoon workout! Great mix of shade and sun - it took us probably an hour for the hike up and then we were able to sit for a bit and just soak in the beautiful view of the salt lake valley. We ended up running the whole way down, so it only took about 15-20 minutes of blissful gravity induced running to reach the bottom! Love all the trees that surround the trail the whole way up! Would definitely recommend "
218,2017-04-22,['hiking'],LOVED this hike. Felt like I was back in Washington hiking through a forest. The trail was awesome because it didn't just go straight up the entire time like a lot of utah hikes. It would go up and then flatten out and then go up again. Made it feel more like an easy hike. This is probably one of my new favorite hikes. Love millcreek canyon.
219,2017-04-16,[''],Great hike!
220,2017-04-13,[''],"Good hike, if you don't have much time."
221,2017-03-26,[''],Great hike with beautiful views. Perfect with the dog. Snowy at the top. I went early so saw no one on my way up. Lots of people on the way down and it did get slushy and muddy by the time I worked my way down the mountain. Also I almost missed the connecting trail to lead up to the slc overlook. You have to go up some rocks to get to the rest of desolation trail. I was a bit confused at that area but I am also new to hiking.
222,2017-03-14,['hiking'],"Still quite snowy though pretty packed, didn't have too much trouble and wasn't wearing yak tracks or anything. Quite a few fallen trees currently across trail, but still a beautiful hike, pretty moderate not too steep. Dog Friendly! Though the trail is a little narrow so be careful with your dogs and other people. Not too crowded, though it was a Monday afternoon/evening. Only down side is you do have to pay to enter the canyon, other wise 5 out of 5."
223,2017-03-14,[''],"Killer trail! Soft packed snow most of the way which made it a better workout. The views were awesome, well trafficked."
224,2017-02-17,['hiking'],"Great hike. Plenty of trees and plenty of views. Some places had a lot of ice, spikes would have been nice. Good length! Beginning seemed harder, the rest was easy to moderate. 
Dogs are good for off leash on odd days, like the rest of the canyon. :)"
225,2017-01-30,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery hiking through the trees. Not very steep. Very packed down.
226,2017-01-16,[''],Great for a winter trail run.
227,2016-12-29,['hiking'],"Did it after the big snow, the trail was good and had been packed down.  Overall a great hike."
228,2016-12-03,['hiking'],Nice night hike
229,2016-11-27,['hiking'],fun trail. too much dog poop along trail
230,2016-11-14,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite hikes in Millcreek. A bit harder and longer then the others. The view is amazing and a good hike to wear out the dogs.
231,2016-11-14,['hiking'],It's a solid hike. 2 miles with a gain of about 1200ish feet. View is definitely worth it. A lot of people around
232,2016-11-13,['horseback riding'],J
233,2016-11-05,['trail running'],Gorgeous sunset run last night!And perfect escape from the inversion! Just watch for those ankle grabbers on the way down.
234,2016-10-15,[''],"Pretty beautiful during this season! Loved the hike and took my pups. Definitely recommend it! Not too hard at all. Went on a Tuesday, early afternoon and there were hardly anybody hiking so that was pretty nice."
235,2016-10-09,['hiking'],"I went on a Sunday morning and although it was a bit more crowded than I would have liked, it wasn't too bad. It took me an hour to get up and just under that to return, and it was pretty easy with a nice view at the top. Lots of people with kids and dogs."
236,2016-10-09,[''],I'm the best hiker in the world! :D I did it.
237,2016-10-08,[''],Don't forget to find the treasure tree!
238,2016-09-27,['hiking'],Not too easy but nothing crazy strenuous. One of my favorite sunset hikes as you spend most of the way up in the shade and have an amazing view of the valley at the end
239,2016-09-25,['hiking'],The pay off was nice but the trail was nothing to write home about.
240,2016-09-25,['hiking'],"We arrived at 6:30 am on Saturday, sept 24th. It was still dark and it was threatening to rain. 
The trail was quiet, and venturing into the darkness was exciting. 
Trail markers guide the way for the first leg of the journey, and when they stop, following the switchbacks (instead of the small off-shoots) is important. 
The trail is steep enough to get your heart pumping. Despite the sky trying to rain, taking my jacket off happened quick. 
As we ventured higher, the sun started to rise. We were still in the clouds, but the light was enough to turn off our lanterns. 
As we gained elevation and entered the mist, the rain started. 
The wind at the top was strong, but the views were amazing. We were high enough to see everything, but the clouds were still blocking most of the landscape. 
The sharp rock formations at the top are great for picture taking and climbing around on. 

Returning to the car seemed much faster, but the rain started pouring harder as well. My flannel and my pants were soaked through. 

This was exactly what I wanted my Saturday to be like."
241,2016-09-21,['hiking'],"Not too crowded in the late afternoon/early evening on a weekday, and seems like a nice one for trail running (saw as many trail runners as hikers). I usually hike with poles but didn't take them and never felt like I needed them. Nice canyon view with the valley below."
242,2016-09-21,['hiking'],"A nice gentle trail with lots of switchbacks and a small scramble to get to the overlook. Beautiful view of the city from the top, although the view is narrowed a bit by the mountains."
243,2016-09-18,['hiking'],Beautiful fall colors and a great view.  First time using this app and it was fun.
244,2016-09-06,['trail running'],This is great trail for running. Crowded yesterday-I assume it will be less so during the week. Gorgeous views at the top!
245,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"This is a nice enough trail, and one thing that may be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your point of view is that it is actually the remnant of a vehicle track.  The only result of this still evident is that the grade is unusually gentle as it winds back and forth along the mountain.  I think the Thayne Canyon trail, which follows the canyon bottom, is quite a bit prettier, but obviously steeper.  But obviously it doesn't go to the overlook."
246,2016-09-02,['hiking'],"The Salt Lake overlook is easy to miss if you're not looking, but made it in about an hour from the parking area, and the view was really great on a clear day. I continued on to where the trail meets up with Thayne Canyon which was quite a steep decent with more of a loose ground, so it was easy to slip. Hiking poles helped there. During this stretch of the hike though, no poles were needed! The grade wasn't very difficult either."
247,2016-08-31,[''],It's perfect for anyone. Young or old. It's a beautiful trail.
248,2016-08-31,[''],Leaves are changing! Gorgeous trail!
249,2016-08-29,[''],One of my favorite trails close to SLC.
250,2016-08-29,['hiking'],"A fun and relatively easy hike with a beautiful view awaiting all hikers at the end. Can easily be done there and back in only a couple hours, with the option of continuing further past Desolation hike and into Mt. Olympus hike (they are connected) if hikers so choose. Beautiful scenic hike the entire way."
251,2016-08-24,['hiking'],"I hiked this trail with one other moderate hiker and two novice hikers. After researching on AllTrails, this one seemed just right for our group, and we were happy to say that it was perfect. It was challenging enough to keep the moderate hikers happy while not too demanding for the novice hikers. We just took our time. The view from the outlook was incredible. While we weren't alone, we never felt it was too crowded either, and we were there on a Sunday afternoon. It was a very meaningful experience for us. Thanks AllTrails!"
252,2016-08-16,[''],I always appreciate hiking in Millcreek Canyon because I can take my dog. this hike is short enough that you can go after work on a weekday and watch the sunset. it's largely shaded has a great View at the end. I jog down.
253,2016-08-15,['hiking'],"Pretty easy trail with a decent view of the canyon, Pipeline Trail and the Salt Lake Valley."
254,2016-08-14,['hiking'],"Nice and easy, mostly shaded, never that steep, a nice quick hike"
255,2016-08-12,['hiking'],love the view! definatly worth the hike
256,2016-08-03,[''],great trail. my dog has never been hiking on a trail or altitude like this and did a really great job. super awesome view at the top. saw a few people but not crowded.
257,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"If you want a fun, easy hike this one is for you. The trail is easy to follow and not too steep. You are mostly shaded the whole time, which is nice on these hot summer days. The view is awesome once you get there but can get quite crowded later in the day."
258,2016-07-18,['hiking'],There was a steady incline the whole way and the trail was partly in the shade and partly in the sun. I have a medium sized dog and he got pretty hot/tired and had some trouble on the rocks at the top. Nice view but I probably won't go back. I went about a mile beyond the overlook and the trail gets pretty narrow.
259,2016-07-16,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. A bit dinner since we got a late start. Perfect intensity for getting back into hiking shape.
260,2016-07-15,['hiking'],Nice view of city. Lots of switchbacks. Well shaded.
261,2016-07-14,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, went in the evening and it definitely cools off a bit on the way down. Took about an hour to get to the top and a little less going down."
262,2016-07-14,['hiking'],Went on a Saturday and it was extremely crowded. Also saw a few rattlesnakes so keep a lookout. Beautiful views! Worth the climb.
263,2016-07-09,[''],Beautiful easy hike. The bugs were almost non-existent this morning. Will do this hike again. The Salt Lake Outlook on a clear day is breathtaking.
264,2016-07-06,['hiking'],"My wife and I did this trail in mid-March. Lots of ice around that she kept slipping on. I would highly recommend wearing MicroSpikes or some sort of similar product.

That being said, we both made it to the top of this quite easily. The view was very good considering the relative ease of the trail."
265,2016-07-06,['hiking'],A perfect escape from the valley heat. Beautiful too.
266,2016-07-01,['hiking'],An awesome hike. I love this trail.
267,2016-06-30,[''],What a beautiful hike. The view was amazing and most of the hike was in the shade.
268,2016-06-28,['hiking'],"This was a nice hike. Very shady for the majority of the trail. Saw a young rattle snake crossing the trail on the way down. It was in a shady area, not in the sunny rocky area as I would have expected. So keep an eye out.
My Fitbit said the trail was 2.45 miles long (one way). The entire hike took a friend and me 2.5 hours to complete with about a 10 minute rest/snack time at the overlook."
269,2016-06-28,['hiking'],Beautiful trail that is perfect for hot summer days as there is good shade coverage. I went in the late afternoon which was ideal as the trail hugs the east side of the mountain. Make sure you don't miss the sign to keep going up to your right over a small rocky area--I passed it and had to double back. The trail itself is nice and winding switchbacks up the mountain. The views are spectacular at the top!
270,2016-06-27,['hiking'],"Great trail and perfect for summer hiking because of the amount of shade! However, be aware of rattlesnakes. We encountered one and barely got past it. There's high grass on both sides of the trail, so listen out and be safe."
271,2016-06-26,['hiking'],"Loved the hike! The views from the top were spectacular! (I would
suggest to go on a clear day for best views)"
272,2016-06-24,[''],"Well kept, we'll marked. Lots of shade."
273,2016-06-22,[''],Still one of my favorite hikes in SLC
274,2016-06-21,['hiking'],"Perfect for an after work hike with plenty of shade! We hiked to the overlook and relaxed for a few minutes on the rocks before continuing to the top of Thayne's Canyon.  We hiked a little over 6 miles in 3.5 hours (2.2 miles to the overlook, approx 1 mile to top of Thayne's Canyon, and 3 miles down Thayne's to the parking lot).  Don't forget bug spray for this hike, especially if you keep going to Thayne's!"
275,2016-06-21,[''],"Such a fun hike! We were a bit rushed for time, but heard there was a lake at the top. We weren't able to go all the way there this time. Does anyone know how many miles it is up to the lake?"
276,2016-06-21,[''],"This was a fun hike. Not too strenuous, mostly relaxing with long switchbacks. Very pretty views all of the way to the top. I think my favorite part was hearing the birds while hiking through the shaded woods"
277,2016-06-20,[''],"Total distance for us was 6.8 miles, but we parked about .53 miles away from the trailhead. Good shade, flies were kind of annoying, but overall a good hike, and easy to follow the main trail, even though it gets a bit narrow at times. View from the top is cool, but I think we will go back when the flies are gone to enjoy it a bit more!"
278,2016-06-18,['hiking'],"This was a great hike. I am a beginner hiker, out of shape and overweight, this one challenged me. Lots of switchbacks with some rock but mainly smooth and nice. The flies were a bit of a nuisance, so I rated this trail 4 stars. The trail is mainly shaded which was nice. The views the entire way are breathtaking. I went on. Dogs leashed day and I had an encounter with two dogs that was scary. I am terrified of large dogs so this was certainly a negative part for me. Otherwise I loved this trail."
279,2016-06-17,['hiking'],"I love this trail. Even though it's easy, it is still one of the prettiest out there. You get a good variety of scenery. Mostly shaded which is a godsend in the summer heat. Long gradual switchbacks, some climbing up small rocks and a thin trail is what you're in for. Went up at 4:45pm on a Thursday after work and the parking was way full but the trail wasn't bad at all. Not very many flies either. My friend and I got bit only once. Spending 30 min at the top, it took us 2hrs 15 min. 1hr 45 min of actual hiking."
280,2016-06-15,['hiking'],"Took my boys and 4 year old daughter up this trail.
We loved it and loved the outlook.
The 4 yr old hiked most of the way up (hand holding was necessary as some spots were rocky or steep off the side of trail) She crashed on the way back and we carried her the whole way back.  But we took turns so it wasn't bad.
Flies were a bit of a nuisance."
281,2016-06-15,['hiking'],Good trail and fantastic view by the lake.
282,2016-06-12,['hiking'],Bugs (flys) were a 1/2 star deduction and crowd was a 1/2 star deduction. Took hike with 6-yr old and the terrain was totally appropriate.
283,2016-06-12,['hiking'],nice short hike with a good view at the top.  get there early to enjoy any alone time.  this one gets crowded as the day goes on.  easy footing.
284,2016-06-10,[''],"Good trail, especially early in the morning before people get there. there were a lot of flies which got annoying but overall it was a nice hike. Not too challenging."
285,2016-06-08,['hiking'],"Hiked up to watch the sunset and it was incredibly beautiful! The hike up felt a little never ending at times, but it wasn't too difficult. Using flashlights on the way down was pretty easy. Definitely one of my favorites."
286,2016-06-08,[''],"A good chunk of the trail is switchbacks, but they aren't very difficult at all. I loved how woodsy this hike was, but there definitely were a ton of flies. Still worth it though!"
287,2016-06-07,['hiking'],"It is a very nice trail. Although, there is a severe fly infestation along the trail. Probably due to an imbalance of species. People say to use bug spray, but I avoid it if I can. The view at the overlook is quite nice and there are several rock features that you can sit on to take in the all the views."
288,2016-06-05,[''],I loved this hike! The view is great from the overlook and it's not too challenging at all!
289,2016-06-05,[''],Great hike for anyone.
290,2016-06-04,['hiking'],up all the way!
291,2016-05-31,['hiking'],"Bring bug spray and USE it! The trail was fairly easy. I'm a bit out of shape but there are plenty of spots to stop and rest. I would say about 85% is shaded which is fantastic I might add. Easy to find too. We have an older rat terrier and a French bulldog both enjoyed it very much and we found it easy for our bull dog. The trail is nothing but switchbacks and on several of the corners and a bit throughout towards the top there are some Ricky areas to be careful on for clumsy people like me. It took us a good two hours round trip. We did stop a lot to rest our bulldog and give water to the girls it was very hot. We also spend a good 30 minutes at the peak. Down hill is much much faster than up. Lol.

*easy trail
*great for dogs
*mostly shaded
*bring bug spray"
292,2016-05-31,[''],Did this trail yesterday. The only complaint I had was a lack of parking near the trail. But I hiked it with my toddler in a hiking pack and it was awesome!!
293,2016-05-30,['hiking'],Great trail view is amazing at the top! Only misses points for the crowds. Lots of dogs perfect for friendly pooches!
294,2016-05-28,['hiking'],"Really fun trail! i will say though that it can be difficult when heading back to find the right trailhead! I started to go on the wrong trail, it could be marked better"
295,2016-05-23,[''],Amazing views from the top.
296,2016-05-22,['hiking'],"Great trail, not to long and great view at the top!"
297,2016-05-20,['hiking'],This trail is a lot of fun! I'm working on getting in shape so this was a great beginner hike and I had a ton of fun running downhill with my pup.
298,2016-05-19,['hiking'],"Loved this hike!! It is so gorgeous at the top, and I would love to do it again!"
299,2016-05-17,[''],"Went on a couple days ago, was good"
300,2016-05-14,['hiking'],"1st Real hike for me, lots of switchbacks but the view from the top makes it worth it."
301,2016-05-10,['hiking'],Easy and beautiful
302,2016-05-09,[''],Great for dogs. My pup is still newer to hiking and I liked this because it keeps dogs on the trail and not wandering all over the mountains. Also lovely trail in the pouring rain
303,2016-05-08,['hiking'],"The trail has switchbacks I did it with hike it baby group, it's easy but long hike, I will advice you take lunch up there."
304,2016-05-05,['hiking'],"This is a favorite. The trail is pretty gradual. There was no snow on the physical  trail.  
A good date hike. Wasn't breathing too hard that I couldn't talk."
305,2016-05-03,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail! Nice, easy hike!"
306,2016-04-23,[''],"This trail was great. It was pretty mellow, about 45-60 minutes to the overlook. I didn't feel like I was done so I hiked up past the overlook for about an hour. There is still a lot of snow higher up so if you do decide to keep going, be careful. The snow is mostly pretty packed down but it's still slushy April snow and can be unpredictable. Overall an easy hike with some great views!"
307,2016-04-23,[''],"This is a perfect, quick trail. I'm a novice hiker, and it was so gratifying to get to the top. Great for dogs too."
308,2016-04-20,[''],"Great trail, & a great view at the overlook.  We will definitely do it again!"
309,2016-04-18,['hiking'],Loved it. There was a few people like it stated. Will definitely go back again:)
310,2016-04-06,['hiking'],Great trail. Still snow and a little muddy as of 4/2/16.
311,2016-04-01,['hiking'],Excellent hike! took my friend and I about 2 hours round trip. the top is still snowy and icy so be careful. i was wearing some old running shoes and i basically was skiing down the mountain haha. great hike though! not too tough in any one place just a nice gradual incline. great view at the top.
312,2016-03-22,[''],"We hiked this trail with babies on our back it is steep and some part of the trail had snow,but I really enjoyed this trail I will go back again in the summer."
313,2016-02-18,['hiking'],"Very nice, moderately easy hike. Pretty views. The trail is well used."
314,2016-02-13,[''],It's great for trial running...!
315,2016-01-24,['snowshoeing'],Beautiful in fresh snow! Switchbacks made it nice gentle elevation gain.
316,2016-01-02,['hiking'],"Nice trail, me and my girlfriend did it in a little over two hours. We strapped our snowshoes on our backs in case, but did it all in boots. Everyone else seemed to be tripping over their own snowshoes. View from the top was stunning, great quick hike."
317,2015-11-17,[''],One of my favorites. The trail was pretty icy this weekend
318,2015-10-28,[''],"Great trail, wonderful view. We left after work and moved at a good pace. Made it up in 55min. Total trip with break at the top was 1:45."
319,2015-10-25,['hiking'],"Took my family ( 12 and 14 year old ) boys up the trail twice this week.  Took 1:40 from parking lot to summit.  50 minutes to return.  Rained all the way back, so come prepared."
320,2015-10-17,['hiking'],"Not too long, not too short. The Salt lake overlook is spectacular. Took about 2.5 hrs for the round trip. Would hike there again."
321,2015-10-15,[''],New to Utah! Great first trail for my dog and I! A little scary at times if your afraid of heights and worried about your dog. :)
322,2015-10-15,['hiking'],"Great hike for anyone, any day of the week. A slight constant gain in elevation but no difficult areas. Took about 3 hours with a half hour being dedicated to enjoying the awesome view at the top!"
323,2015-10-04,['hiking'],"Very steady incline the entire way with switchbacks to make it more gradual. Like all hikes on the Wasatch, ""easy"" (as many reviewers have called it) is all relative. If you are an avid hiker this will still be a workout, but does not pose any significant challenges. If you are a beginner and not in great shape, you'll feel it on the way up. It really is a ""moderate"" difficulty hike. The colors are the best about mid-late September. Mix of sun and shade in the morning and mostly shade by afternoon. Fantastic view of the Salt Lake valley by the overlook."
324,2015-09-28,['hiking'],Fairly easy hike with pretty views.
325,2015-09-27,['hiking'],"Just completed this hike this morning. The hike is relatively easy, with no really challenging areas. The top is a great place to stop and rest and take in the views for a while before heading down. It gets pretty crowded around 9:30-10 am on weekends, so it's better to go earlier before the trail gets a lot of people on it. Overall, an awesome hike. The fall colors are just starting to come out, and it was beautiful."
326,2015-09-21,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite hikes. Trail is cut into the side of the mountain, and is quite narrow in places with steep drop off's, but nothing too bad. There are a lot of hikers with dogs on this trail, so just be careful on the parts where the trail is narrow - dogs don't give way!!"
327,2015-09-20,['hiking'],"Great hike! Very beautiful views along the hike and at the top as well. We all enjoyed this one and there was a lot of shade as well. Not too difficult but a good steady incline! This is a ""must do again and again hike""."
328,2015-09-10,['hiking'],Peaceful and shady. Nice hike!
329,2015-08-25,['hiking'],"A great trail if you want something short and easy.  It's not too steep and offers a great view of the Salt Lake Valley, but you won't see downtown.  Most of the trail is on the East side of the mountain with a lot of exposure to the morning sun.  Make sure you bring lots of water!  
The trail is pretty well maintained but rocky in parts.  "
330,2015-08-19,['hiking'],"The view at the overlook is fantastic and made it all worth it.  The trail is challenging, but not too difficult.  There are a few spots where the trail is really narrow, which caused some anxiety for a few people in my group.  Still, I highly recommend - this was one of my favorite hikes!"
331,2015-08-18,['hiking'],"Lovely!   The views were spectacular in all directions except for SLC. The pollution was heavy and there was a nasty haze. Try to go on a clear day.
Several shady stretches to keep you cool. A bit challenging but not too taxing - unless you want to run up and down the trail, which some people were doing. I was exhausted just watching them :)."
332,2015-08-13,['hiking'],This is a great trail--like all the trails in Mill Creek canyon--dogs can be off leash on odd numbered days but require a leash on even numbered days so if like J Burke you don't like to interact with dogs off leash then go on even numbered days
333,2015-08-09,[''],Fun time was had by all. Even with the jerk ladies that didn't have their dog leashed and tried to eat our dog. Leashes aren't optional on this trail. If your dog or children are jerks try a leash. :)
334,2015-08-02,[''],"This trail is awesome! It's not too hard, but it's not too easy. It's a perfect combination of the two. Plus the view at the top is absolutely gorgeous. I would definitely recommend it!"
335,2015-07-27,['hiking'],"This trail is one of the most beautiful and lush I've ever hiked. The overlook has a beautiful view of the Salt Lake valley and the surrounding mountains. It began to storm while I was there, completing the spectacular experience. It's not difficult, and should be fine for kids ten and up."
336,2015-07-16,[''],"Love this trail, beautiful even when it's super hot out. We kept going over to thaynes canyon passed the overlook and down the dried out creekbed, was definitely a little shaky at time but worth it!"
337,2015-07-12,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite hikes. Not too easy but not too strenuous, and the view is a great payoff!"
338,2015-07-01,[''],great hike with an amazing view at the end!!
339,2015-06-24,[''],It was great!... Wouldn't say it was super easy but it was doable.
340,2015-06-08,[''],One of the best day hikes
341,2015-06-02,['hiking'],"So pretty and a fairly good hike, the view is absolutely amazing! We hit it just at sunset and was absolutely stunned!"
342,2015-05-31,[''],Beautiful views on the switch backs. Nice and shaded.
343,2015-05-29,['hiking'],"Its an awesome hike on such a perfect sunny day!! Somehow I was thinking it would be a difficult hike, but man was I wrong lol. No parts I would consider steep. There is little snow right before you reach the lake, but not enough to worry about. It took me a little over an hour to get there. I took my sweet time heading back taking pictures of the beatuiful scenery. I will be back again, and maybe a few more times before the summer ends."
344,2015-05-28,[''],Nice easy walk...saw plenty of deer and wildlife
345,2015-05-27,['hiking'],"Very well maintained trail, lots of pretty forest, rewarding view at the end. Really fun trail to run down too! Can be very, very busy but it's easy to avoid crowds by going on weathery days, early in the morning, or during the week."
346,2015-05-25,['hiking'],Awesome hike for a wide array of skill levels.  The trail is well-maintained and very smooth so you can even get away with wearing shoes that may not have good tread.  Right now with all the rain it is incrdibly lush with a smattering of wild flowers of all colors!  It is well shaded and the overlook is a nice payoff with many photo-opps around the rocks below the overlook.
347,2015-05-25,[''],Great view at the top!!
348,2015-05-04,['hiking'],"Great hike. Not too hard, lots of switchbacks. Would do it again"
349,2015-05-01,['trail running'],"Great ""chill"" trail. Not too hard and the view and rocks at the look out are pretty cool. We hiked up and ran down. Will be back for this one."
350,2015-04-24,['hiking'],Did this hike in the beginning of April with my two dogs. Trail has pretty heavy usage by dog owners. Mainly switchbacks so the trail is very skinny to be passing others with dogs. Has a beautiful view into the Salt Lake Valley at the end. There is no water source along the way so be sure to pack enough water for you and dogs if you are bringing them.
351,2015-04-13,['hiking'],"Completed on March 20, 2015. We hiked Desolation trail to the Salt Lake Valley Overlook, then continued on to the Thayne Canyon turnoff. About a half mile before the turnoff we encountered quite a bit of snow and really should have had snowshoes, or at least microspikes, but didn't have either. We continued down Thayne Canyon but it was very steep and therefore slow going as we tried to ensure we didn't slip and fall or posthole through the snow crust. Regardless, it was a great hike! (Tracks uploaded)"
352,2015-04-13,['hiking'],"Well marked trail, lots of switchbacks but very pretty. Hiked up & ran down, worked perfect for me. Good view, popular trail."
353,2015-03-30,['hiking'],Hiked this trail with my mother and aunt.  Had a wonderful time.  The view is beautiful and so worth the climb.
354,2014-09-25,['hiking'],"If you time it right, you can watch the full moon rise from the top: breath-taking!"
355,2014-08-19,['hiking'],"If you are a beginner, this is a great trail to take up about 0.8 miles with easy switchbacks and mostly shady.  At the split back over to Thaynes Canyon you can loop back left and back down a nice creek bed trail to the parking lot (about 1.7 miles).  Once you accomplish this, you can head up the rest of Desolation Trail to the outlook.  This portion of the trail is more moderate, becomes sunny past 10am and before about 4 pm.  There are 5-6 areas of rocks that jut across the trail and require some extra initiative going up and even more so coming down so if you have bad hips or knees this is definitely more challenging on this half of the trail. I recorded 4.23 miles from the parking lot to the lookout and back down with 1182 elevation change per my Map my Hike App.  If you return down the Thaynes Canyon side, it is less crowded with people heading up the trail, nice and wide  
I agree with other comments that there is no water so take plenty. Great for dogs and a beautiful hike!"
356,2014-07-01,['hiking'],It's a Nice trail time do in the summer. it is very shaded and Beautiful views
357,2014-06-22,['hiking'],"Beautiful views. Lots of trees for shade. The switchbacks take some uphill work, but I'm a beginner hiker and had no trouble. Great hike!"
358,2014-06-22,['hiking'],"Beautiful trees and carpets of green. Loved the view of Salt Lake. Lots of trees for shade. The switchbacks require some uphill work, but I'm a beginner hiker and had no trouble. Great hike!"
359,2013-12-01,['hiking'],We hiked in about a foot of snow towards the top. We counted over fifteen switchbacks. Got kind of monotonous. Made it to the top and the wind was howling. Clouds blocked our view of the valley.
360,2013-09-12,['hiking'],Beautiful trail with easy access. What a great overlook of the Salt Lake valley.
361,2013-08-22,['hiking'],Hiked with a youth group. Nice view of the valley
362,2013-08-20,['trail running'],"Wonderful jogging trail with a fabulous reward of a view at the end.   You can continue up to the elbow fork trailhead, or come down from there to this overlook.   

I've done this jog a few times before work and love it."
363,2013-07-15,['hiking'],Nice shady trail to rock outcrop. RT to the Desolation TH is actually 5 miles.
364,2013-06-29,['hiking'],"We were determined to hike today, despite the 100+ degree weather, so we opted for Desolation Trail because I read that it is frequently shaded.  We made a good choice! It was still extremely hot but I can't imagine hiking today without the great shade we had for most if the hike.  Lots if switchbacks on a narrow trail (single-file folks!) through forest on steep ledges.  This ""moderate"" hike was good for us as we are just starting out on our hiking adventures, but still want a challenge. We were amazed to see a couple of runners flying up the trail... Kudos!  The view if Salt Lake Valley makes for a nice treat at the top. I look forward to taking this hike again in the fall as I can only imagine how gorgeous the fall colors will be!"
365,2013-05-27,['hiking'],"This was my first time hiking in Millcreek Canyon and it was perfect. The trail is mostly shaded with lots of switchbacks. It is a beautiful trail and has an amazing overlook of the Salt Lake Valley. It is a popular trail, so expect many people. Dogs are allowed off leash on odd days and mountain bikers are allowed even days. Vehicles pay a $3 fee when you leave the canyon. "
366,2013-05-20,['hiking'],This is a great trail to do when it is really hot outside - almost fully shaded and so close to SLC. There is no water on the trail so make sure to bring your own.
367,2012-10-20,['hiking'],"Hiked this one with a pre-teen group, siblings and parents. The youngest was 8, and she handled it fine. The trail is steep in places with many switchbacks and the kids did some whining. We stopped at the outlook to SLC, which was 2 miles. The view was fantastic with beautiful fall colors. The return back down was much faster and the kids really enjoyed it. A lot of people and dogs were there but the trail was clean. There are some narrow sections with drop-offs, but not dangerous if you pay attention. "
368,2012-08-03,['hiking'],Desolation trail was one if my first hike I did when I came to Utah. Boy was I in for a surprise! I came to visit in April to check out the city. Didn't think it would snow in April but it did. I wore regular tennis shoes and gym pants to hike. Everything below my knee cap was soaking wet and I fell a few times. Definitely need to get hiking boots or snow shoes when hiking this trail. It's all uphill with about 70 switchbacks. The view at the top is beautiful as its an overlook of salt lake city itself.  Dogs are allowed on odd numbered days and mountain bikes on even numbered days. Nice trail though! I'd hike this again in the summer though :)
369,2012-04-11,['hiking'],Great trail year round (snowshoe or Yak tracks in winter). K9 off leash friendly on odd calendar days. You can out and back or loop with several trails. Millcreek is a wonderful canyon with an abundance of great trails for hiking/biking/horseback enthusiasts. Most everyone abides by the hierarchy of trail courtesy.     
370,2011-05-17,['hiking'],"What a fun hike.  There are lots of people who do this hike of all ages.  Many bring their dogs on odd days.  (Even days are leash days, which seems to keep dogs off the hills.)  I especially enjoy this area in the winter because you don't overheat so easily.
Anyway, this day, I went beyond the overlook, which is a great view, in order to find the rest of the trail for the ""larger"" loop that connects to Thayne Canyon.  However, the snow hid it from me.  So I went up the ridge in snowshoes.  Met a couple there that was coming down.  They couldn't find the trail either.  I followed their tracks up the hill and when I came back down I found a 6' snowman they built at 7000'.  What a fun surprise!  It was odd seeing it above the packed trail and at such an altitude, when you think you're all alone..."
