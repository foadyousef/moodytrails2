0,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Wildflowers and wild mushrooms galore! Challenging hike with an overview of desolation lake at the top.
1,2019-08-16,['hiking'],Tough hike but totally worth it. Wildflowers everywhere and incredible views.
2,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'bugs']","This trail is so beautiful and rewarding. Wildflowers and Aspens the whole way up. Took us 2 hours to get up and 1 to get down. The last stretch is tough, but I believe you can handle it! My 5 year old did it, I did it with a 40 pound pack on my back, and we passed a couple hikers much older than us who did it. You can do it too! Then relax at the top and enjoy the breeze and views."
3,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"I came down this trail after going up past Desolation Lake to the Wasatch Crest trail on the Mill D trail. You can tell this is going to be steep considering that you get to the same high point over twice the distance going up Mill D. The Beartrap Fork trail junction off of Wasatch Crest is unmarked, so you kind of have to know what to look for. Coming down, the first mile is super steep and kind of slippery in the sand and gravel. Going up that stretch would be tough, but probably not much slower than coming down,considering the iffy footing. After that first mile it levels out, with a little mud here and there, and some easy creek crossings. Completely shaded and empty early in the morning. There are tread marks on the trail the whole way, so I suspect that some (crazy) folks are coming down this trail on mountain bikes."
4,2019-07-13,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Took the wife and I about 2.5 hrs up, 1 hour back. We were surprised at how steep it is, but we made it. Shady most of the way. Beautiful views, flowers we gorgeous the whole way up. "
5,2019-07-10,['hiking'],"Hiked 1.7 miles up this canyon this evening.    I didn’t make it to the top as I ran out of time.  It’s a little difficult but very beautiful.  Saw a deer, a grouse and one chick.....but no bears!  I was alone until heading back down and met a group of about 20 hikers.
I’ll do this hike again, but not alone!
Also, I was surprised at how many Columbine flowers I saw, they were amazing!"
6,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'muddy']",A beautiful trail. Winding your way through Aspens and bushes. Saw a deer and a moose. Sadly did not run into a bear. Great view of Desolation Lake at the top. Hardly anyone else on the trail. Definitely coming back.  The snow is gone now. 
7,2019-05-12,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'snow']",I went in trail running shoes  and made it about halfway before I decided to turn back. I could’ve kept going but had a feeling the snow would be much softer on the way down (which was true).  . First half mile the trail is fine from there on out there is snow. If I had micro spikes I may have kept going. Saw one deer. Not another human being the whole time.  Will hike it again when the snow is gone as it could be very beautiful
8,2018-10-08,['hiking'],Lots of snow.  Still very beautiful.  Saw 3 moose and 3 deer along the trail.
9,2018-09-04,['hiking'],Hiked up Beartrap Fork and over the spine of Desolation Peak.
10,2018-07-16,['hiking'],Hiked this on 7/14/18. This trail was extremely beautiful and serene. I descended down this trail after hiking up mill d trailhead to desolation lake. There were so many meadows with wildflowers and it was canopy with a lot of shade. I didn’t run into any other hikers.. but did run into a bear about 20-30 feet off the trail. He was aware that we were there and let us pass without any issues but please be aware of this!
11,2018-07-16,['hiking'],"I went early in the morning of July 10, 2018.  Taking it slow and pausing to enjoy the surroundings, many times along the way with shade, cool breeze, no insects and loads of wildflowers.  I only spent 1 1/2 up.  When I got to the large meadow before the straight up climb I turned around.  The meadow had been reached by the Sun at that point.  I had never hiked alone and will never do it again.  Praying all the way round trip and being alert and cautious.  It was dumb to do alone but for just this once I was in Heaven.  I saw one deer on the way up to the right of me and two together to my left on the way back down."
12,2018-07-14,['hiking'],"WARNING: I know I was probably the 1 in 1,000, but I ran into a bear smack dab in the middle of this trail. This spooked hiker suggests not hiking this trail alone, and bringing bear spray."
13,2018-07-12,['hiking'],Just did this hike last Sunday. Steep pretty much the whole way up. Tons of flies will suck the soul out of you. Trail is engulfed by tall plants. For the most part it was a pretty hike and definitely beautiful at the top. If you love flies this is the hike for you!
14,2018-06-11,['hiking'],"Had a hard time finding the trail head. We went up Beartrap Fork Rd. and came down where the trailhead really is, but we made it up. We were the only ones there and back, and the trail is all shaded until you get to the top. Steep but well worth it. Could see Desolation Lake from the top."
15,2017-11-14,[''],Very steep with some Icy parts glad we had our micro spikes. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
16,2017-09-05,[''],It lived up to it's reputation.
17,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. I saw 7 people on the trail in the 2 1/2 hours I was out. I agree the last 1/2 mile is very steep, but worth the effort if you don't like traffic on your hikes. The flowers were blooming today and the creek bed dry for crossing. If you turn right at the Great Western Trail, it is only about 100 yd to a great view of the Park City area (Formerly the Canyons.) I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the steep climb to the crest, and having to walk on the heavily trafficked bike trail along the crest to Desolation lake."
18,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike up the gulch, fairly steep incline but with good shoes not a problem. Crossed the creek 6 times over all with putt any issues. Flowers were in bloom and the views from up to were breath taking. One can see down to desolation lake, Tyne valley to Park City, and the Salt Lake Valley."
19,2017-07-27,['hiking'],Fantastic wildflowers.  Very green.  Hardly anyone there.
20,2017-07-10,['hiking'],"Hiked up to the Wasatch Crest via the Mill D (Desolation Lake trail).  Climbed to desolation peak, (no trail, just need to go up).  Took the Beartrap trail on the way down.  The upper third of this trail is very steep.  (Would have rather come up this trail than down.)   The scenery was even better than the Mill D trail,  and far far fewer people."
21,2017-07-03,['hiking'],"Super steep in places, so I was glad I had trekking poles! Absolutely gorgeous hike. I highly recommend continuing up the Wasatch Crest Trail at the end for great views of Desolation Lake and Park City!"
22,2017-06-26,['hiking'],Beautiful and peaceful.   Wildflowers in bloom.
23,2017-06-22,['trail running'],This Trail sucks for running don't do it.
24,2017-06-15,['hiking'],"I did this hike on June 1 as part of a loop to Desolation Lake and Mill D. The first mile was moderate, before the second creek crossing where it disappeared under the snow. The second mile was measurably steeper and was a toil even with crampons. Snowshoes would have been a better choice for the lower portion, but after reaching the pass I made a fairly treacherous traverse to meet up with the trail again and was glad to have the traction.

I would do this trail again in early season, but without knowing the trail conditions I would expect to need snowshoes and spikes. Apparently now (June 12), the snow is less of a factor."
25,2017-06-12,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes anywhere.   This is more of a moderate hike.   Not much snow on top.  Great views of aspen, rivers, lakes, flowers, snow capped peaks!"
26,2017-01-08,['snowshoeing'],Snowshoes very fun
27,2017-01-01,[''],"This was a great hike for New Year's Eve. I was using snowshoes, but I followed the track of someone who wasn't. Looks like post hole hiking without snowshoes for sure, so be prepared. Great views from the saddle and Desolation peak looking over Park City Resort. Started early in the dark with hopes of reaching the summit for sunrise but I underestimated my time and it took a full 2 hrs with stops for pictures to reach the top. Will definitely be back in the spring for another go."
28,2016-10-11,['hiking'],"Lovely trail up to the Wasatch Crest and beautiful desolation lake.  Relatively easy grade lower down, then climbs sharply after passing through a lovely meadow.  As others have said, the lack of traffic is a real advantage.  I made a nice loop up beartrap and down Mill D, and did not see a single soul on Beartrap while I was passing people all the time on the lower section of Mill D.  There was snow on the ground as low as 8100' in the deep slot that makes the upper canyon.  I imagine snow holds there well into spring as well."
29,2016-08-18,['hiking'],"If you are looking for a different route to Desolation Lake than Mill D North, than Beartrap Fork is the way to go. Basically zero traffic, so the trail will be all yours.Once you get up to the Wasatch Crest Trail, you can follow it towards the lake and overlooks of the Park City area. Although there is no trail, you can very easily hike up the hill to Desolation Peak (9990 ski lift is there too). The view of Little Cottonwood Canyon is great!"
30,2016-08-17,['hiking'],this was a fun trip and I enjoyed the hiking at the first mile is pretty easy through Forest and Aspen Grove. the Second Mile and got progressively steeper and the last quarter mile was pretty steep. the view from the top is really nice looks out over the Salt Lake Valley to the Solitude ski resort and down to Desolation Lake. not too many bugs some wildflowers with lots of bees. The best part was we only saw three other people the entire day good hike but they take some time and is fairly difficult if you're not used to hiking at this altitude.
31,2016-07-16,[''],My favorite trail ever!
32,2016-06-20,['hiking'],"Ended up coming down this trail from hiking up to Desolation Lake.  It is a beautiful, quiet side canyon.  Would be very steep going up, and was somewhat difficult in places coming down (especially closer to the ridgeline).  There were several downed trees and some creek crossings along the way."
33,2016-06-15,[''],this hike was awesome. it was very much up hill but when you get to the top the view is awesome and you can see the lake. we went down to the lake and coming back up was very steep. even though it kicked our butt's it was still worth it!
34,2016-04-08,['snowshoeing'],"Safe to snowshoe up in the winter if you avoid the open spaces on the west side of the canyon.
Fun to hike and join with the Wasatch Crest/Park City Ridgeline in the summer"
35,2015-09-07,['hiking'],"Loved this hike. Went over Labor day weekend with my hiking buddy and saw NO ONE else on the Beartrap Fork Trail. Once we hit the Great Western trail we saw shared the trail with a few mountain bikers, a couple of trail runners and a few hikers. It is worth following the Great Western Trail to overlook Desolation Lake and down into the Canyons ski resort. The views are spectacular. We were startled by 2 bull moose bedding near the trail on the way down. They seemed unimpressed with us and were more likely letting us know they were around and to keep walking. The trail head is hard to find. If you are driving up Big Cottonwood look for a road named Beartrap Fork road to the left just as you enter the Brighton cottage area. You can park on the side of the road and hike the paved road to the end where you connect with the trail. Take a right and keep hiking up and up and up. The trail has some shady areas as well as open meadow. As stated the trail is well maintained but it is steep ( we were thankful for trekking poles). The stream bed was dry this time of year. Took us 3.5-4 hours in total with a break for lunch and to enjoy the views."
36,2015-07-17,['hiking'],"This is another route to Desolation Lake and Trail. This one is much less traveled and more steep. Route is not cleared marked at the end due to erosion. It is also shorter in distance. You end up on top of the lake. It gets more windy and much cooler there.

When you reach the top, you are on Wasatch Crest Trail/Great Western Trail. You may see some bikers there."
37,2015-06-30,['hiking'],"Nice, quick, quiet and somewhat inclined hike.  I got charged by a mother grouse.  The views from the top over to Canyons is great.  It is somewhat tricky to find though if you don't know what to look for."
38,2015-06-24,['hiking'],We started at the very bottom and hiked the 3 or so miles up to where you can see Desolation Lake. The hike from the start was pretty up hill and was consistently so though the whole way up. The 0.5 miles down to Desolation Lake are definitely worth it! Going back down the trail was a little tough due to the gravely trails so there was some slipping going on. But I would definitely recommend the trail!
39,2015-06-13,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful trail! Not too challenging until the last mile where the incline is a bit steeper. Still totally doable and totally worth it. Saw two deer on the way up and one on the way down. You meet up with with the Wasatch Crest trail at the top of Beartrap Fork and can head up to Desolation Peak (which you should do, it's a very short climb!) or continue along the Wasatch Crest to a gorgeous view of Desolation Lake, Gobbler's, Raymond and Kessler."
40,2015-05-25,['snowshoeing'],Great short trail for snowshoeing. It takes you to a ridge where you can look over into Canyons resort. You can also see down to Desolation Lake. Would like to hike this in the summer then I can give a report on the trail itself.
41,2014-11-02,['trail running'],Start 0.31 miles down the canyon from Beartrap Road at gate with watershed sign across from Rivers End Road/Coyote Run Lane street signs.
