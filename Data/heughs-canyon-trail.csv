0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],finding the trailhead was a pain.  had to walk up a driveway to get to the trail.  otherwise the trail was nice.  pretty crowded. 
1,2019-09-05,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Trail was in excellent condition although a bit tricky to find trail head as you first need to walk through a neighbor. You’ve got cross a steep hill covered on boulders towards the end too. Doable but just be aware. 
2,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","I hiked this trail today (8/25/2019) with my dog. I was a bit hesitant to go because of all the recent snake sightings, but I've hiked this trail a handful of times and never once saw a snake.
We started at 7:40am and got back to the car by 10:30am (we hiked at a slow pace and relaxed at the top for quite some time), no snakes in sight!
I'd recommend bringing bug spray, especially if you plan on taking breaks on the way up to the waterfall. The waterfall was weak compared to a few months ago, but the hike overall was very nice!
"
3,2019-08-25,['hiking'],look out for rattlesnakes and thirsty yellow jackets
4,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"I’d definitely recommend only doing it when there’s still snow runoff, if your goal is to see the waterfall. "
5,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"Saw three snakes yesterday on our hike. Started the hike around 5 pm. One rather large snake (likely a bull snake) hidden in the rock field towards the end and two rattle snakes on the trail that rattled at us and one wouldn’t let us pass so we ended up turning around. With this level of snake sighting directly on the trail, probably won’t be back."
6,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"We parked at the parking lot by the main road. Not clear where the trailhead starts. You have to walk through a neighborhood before starting the trail. Enjoyed the hike, however, it has some steep parts. We also ran into a coiled rattlesnake. It was decently big. Met a couple of other hikers who also encountered a rattlesnake. Be aware, especially if you bring dogs. "
7,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"It was a great hike, except for the snake on the trail. I will do it again,  but be more aware of snakes.

8,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'scramble']","Went up in the morning with my kelpie and we heard a bigger animal, totally freaked my dog out, and me!! Full mohawk, barking and whimpering. I slowly backed away going back down. Stay safe y'all carry bear spray it protects against all mammals. I think it might have been a mountain lion."
9,2019-08-01,['hiking'],"Definitely better in the spring. The waterfall is only a trickle now. Lots of wasps by the water. Raspberry bushes are big. Still very green above the waterfall. No one on the trail today but me. Watch out for snakes: most people mistake the gopher snake for a rattlesnake which isn’t a bad thing but all the reviews make it sound like there are rattlesnakes around every corner. I’ve done this trail dozens of times and never seen a rattlesnake, not to say they aren’t there but I think most people assume it’s a rattlesnake. I’ve seen them in the grass and they always scurry off when I go by. GPS seems to have trouble with accuracy in this canyon but the trail is easy to follow."
10,2019-07-29,['hiking'],Great trail for dogs due to the multiple river crossings. A lot of shade depending on the time of the day. Nice little waterfall. House at the Trailhead sometimes has a 'dog poop' bucket for you on the way down. 
11,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble']","We didn’t get to finish because at the boulder part, me and my 12&11 yr old ran into two rattlesnakes... bummer. I’d say I’m in good shape, and this was a lovely challenge. Little much for my kids, but I would like to do it again. Lots of water and bug spray is a good idea."
12,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",This hike was a really fun one.  Not steep really at all but make sure you have water. And be weary of rattlesnakes.  My friends and I saw two on the trail so that made for an interesting rest of the hike.
13,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'scramble']","From the parking lot, to the waterfall and back was a steep 3.5 miles. We got directions from the parking lot to the trailhead from the Girl on a Hike blog. 
Once we got to the boulder field we had a hard time finding the falls, so I uploaded some photos that should be helpful to figure hikers!
You’ll want bug spray! "
14,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble']","I was a bit worried for this hike because it was my first in a few years, but I genuinely enjoyed it! The parking is on Wasatch Boulevard, you can navigate to it through google and then it’s up into the neighborhood, a left on Oak Canyon Dr, right on Canyon Winds Ln, and all the way up. You pretty much have to walk through the house at the end’s driveway, but that is in fact the trailhead (it isn’t marked, that I saw). We luckily had a nice mailman making his rounds to help us out.
The trail itself is paved pretty well, though the dirt does get slippery the steeper it gets. The entire hike is pretty much an incline, and as you go further the trail gets more narrow and more steep. I would definitely recommend having a walking stick or trekking pole, both to stabilize yourself toward the end, and to rustle the brush for snakes. We didn’t see any, but I was making a LOT of noise to avoid it thanks to the other reviews.
And if you have a bee allergy, please be cautious and bring your Epi pen! There were several spots where we had to walk through swarms of wasps because there was water on the trail. We didn’t get stung, they minded their own business and let us pass as long as we didn’t linger, but I would still be careful!
And for dogs and small kids, please be aware that to GET to the water, you have to scale across the red rocks that a lot of people have posted pictures of, so I’d be cautious if you can’t carry them and they don’t have sure footing. Bring plenty of water in case you can’t get to the falls because that obstacle is right at the end. We passed a lot of tired dog owners on our way back down who asked us if they were close because their pup was hot.
Once you get across to the lower part of the trail, you go through a tunnel made by the trees and the grotto there is tiny but beautiful and shaded. It was clean and quiet, and really refreshing after the climb.
My only trouble was that we didn’t finish the hike, I assume you had to climb up the rocks instead of across to get to the last .2 miles of the hike but I’m not sure. Either way, if I went back I think I would want to try to complete it and see what else there was to experience."
15,2019-07-20,"['hiking', 'bugs']","It’s hard to get to the actual trail, I recommend reading the site girl on a hike dot com to actually see how to get there. It’s nice, shaded and not crowded. It gets pretty steep and bring bug spray!! I didn’t make it to the waterfall because I had my pup and I was scared of sliding down the gravel "
16,2019-07-17,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",
17,2019-07-12,['hiking'],"This trail has a lot of shade and is so pretty. The trail follows a stream that is pretty swift so keep a good eye on your little ones! I only hike up to the big rock pile, sit on a rock and eat a snack or look at the valley. I am not advanced (or adventurous) enough to scale them and go to the waterfall. There is not a lot of parking so I'm not sure where you are allowed to park on a busy day. "
18,2019-07-12,['hiking'],Could never find the entrance to the trail head very disappointing as I was looking forward to this hike with my dog after work if anyone has better directions that would be great I parked where it said trail head parking and water at all it through the neighborhoods and never found a marked or else
19,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"Fantastic option for a steep that is mostly shaded. The stream is really running strong but the main waterfall was covered by the vegetation this year. The trail continues across the rock slide but then it became way too overgrown to continue to the very end, especially with the rattlesnake sightings.  "
20,2019-07-05,['hiking'],Super awesome. Really steep for a good incline most of the hike. But I saw kids and other younger kids doing it. It definitely wasn’t an easy hike. The waterfall is small...but cool I guess. Fun hike! 
21,2019-07-01,['hiking'],Dang that hike did not disappoint. The first half was “eh” then all of a sudden boom there is the river and the waterfall was gorgeous! Wasn’t expecting how pretty it was going to be. Then if you keep going up past the waterfall...the vegetation gets thicker and thicker...and it was gorgeous! Highly recommend....it’s pretty steep at points...so you have to work for it...but it’s worth it! Bugs kind of sucked..so be prepared for that. And WATCH OUT for rattlesnakes. Saw one on the way up and he wouldn’t move off the trail. So be careful! All in all...great hike!

23,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Amazing hike, bumped into a baby rattle on the way up and turned back. Can’t wait to come back!"
24,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'scramble']","Hike to the lower falls is worth the climb, you get to this about 1.5miles up and there is a rock scramble (as others have said) to actually view the falls.

From there we went all the way to the top (and end of the red all trails line) and it gets steep with a lot of loose rock and I would call fully difficult.  I had a single pole and that was invaluable.  This part of the hike I would recommend two poles.  The view at the top is good for the valley but we couldn't see the waterfall only hear it through the foliage"
25,2019-06-27,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
26,2019-06-27,"['hiking', 'over grown']","It is a short but intense route, the slope increases little by little, the final section has large rocks that cover the path to the waterfall, if you want to go to the waterfall be careful when crossing over the rocks"
27,2019-06-27,['hiking'],"I love this trail. It’s weird because you almost have to walk up someone ms driveway to get to it, but it seems to be legal! It’s fairly steep, but really beautiful. Nice workout and the falls are amazing!"
28,2019-06-22,['hiking'],Great short trail for a good little work out. Beautiful views. Be aware of the Poison Ivy at the bottom. Stay on the trail and you should be fine. 
29,2019-06-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Solid uphill hike that is fairly shaded. Careful with dogs as we saw 2 snakes on the trail. 
30,2019-06-21,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Amazing hike! To get to the actual trail head you have to park at the designated parking area and walk up into a residential area and into a drive way. Lots of tree coverage and streams. The trail gets steep towards the end but the view is totally worth it!
31,2019-06-20,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Seems a bit on the hard side of ""moderate"" due to how steep it is, the loose gravel, and the scrambling.  Still, it's a nice and challenging hike."
32,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Great uphill hike. The landslide of rocks was fun to climb. Found the trail on the other side. There is a lot of green vegetation which made it difficult to see the falls at the end of the trail. 
33,2019-06-15,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Lots of shade, gets steep at times. We weren't able to find the trail to the waterfall, and the last part of the trail was not marked very well. Would recommend not following it all the way up the path that AllTrails gives."
34,2019-06-12,['hiking'],"Good evening hike, lots of vegetation"
35,2019-06-09,['hiking'],Just decided to record above the falls today
36,2019-06-09,['hiking'],this is a slightly steep trail the last part of the ascent is steep with loose gravel which is slippery going down.
37,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'scramble']","It was an uphill hike the whole way, however, it was beautiful and worth the time! We were warned about poison ivy but never ran into any. "
38,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","The walk from the parking on Wasatch Blvd to the trailhead is pretty characteristic of the average steepness of the trail. We just hiked to the waterfall next to the big scramble/bouldering section. As someone who goes pretty slow, this hike took me about three hours."
39,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble']","It was amazing, the trail was a little narrow. Lots of flies buzzing around. A steep incline the whole time. Very rocky, hearing the water coming down was amazing to hear."
40,2019-06-06,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'private property', 'scramble']","A nice, steep trail with lots of loose rocks in a quiet neighborhood- the waterfall at the top was our payoff. 

The trailhead is indeed down in the neighborhood as there are several No Parking signs along the street adjacent to the entry into the canyon.  I was surprised at the number of hikers for a Wednesday night.  With with high water year, the stream seemed fast and high but not overly dangerous. The water often spills out onto the trail in a few spots but nothing a tall pair of boots can’t wade through or some creative jumping can’t solve.  We were swarmed with mosquitos at the top at dusk.  I’m guessing there’s standing water areas under the talus field at the top. Great views as you descend too.  Hiking poles for the downhill hike would have been helpful."
41,2019-06-03,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Gets a bit overgrown and much more slippery past the rocky area.
42,2019-06-02,"['rocky', 'scramble']","this is a great hike.  After the second bridge there are two rock scrambles that you have to do.  The first waterfall is visible from the top of the first scramble.  To get to the second you have to go up the second rock scramble and take the trail to the right.  It's not all the way to the top but is easy to see as you go up the right side.  Follow that trail around to include a couple steep climbs and you'll find it at the very end.  The trail literally ends at a large rock wall but the waterfall is visible in the distance.  While not an easy hike it's worth the effort.  bri g trekking poles though, you'll need them.  Also, you see phrase scramble several times but really it's where there was a landslide and you are picking your way through the rocks to get back on the trail.  "
43,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",
44,2019-06-02,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! There is plenty of shade and water next to you throughout the hike. 
45,2019-06-02,['hiking'],Beautiful this time of year. Lots of water in the waterfall and super green in the canyon. 
46,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"The hike is relatively moderate, once cross the second bridge its gets steep for 400 feet or so scramble across the boulders and check out the waterfall. Keep right and hike up the boulders and the trail picks back up . But be warned it gets incredibly steep about a half mile up . Poles will be required "
47,2019-05-31,['hiking'],"beautiful hike! the trail was amazing. my 10, 7, and 5 Year old were able to make it up and back 2 miles. "
48,2019-05-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
49,2019-05-27,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, the waterfall is beautiful"
50,2019-05-25,['hiking'],"I’d rate this hike as hard instead of moderate. The last part was particularly steep on the way up and there were lots of loose rocks on the way down. Very pretty hike, though, and the views of the waterfall and of the valley were great!"
51,2019-05-25,['hiking'],This trail was great! Lots of uphill action. We didn’t see any rattlers to be afraid of. A few rock scrambles. This is a great hike! Definitely recommend!
52,2019-05-25,[''],"Looks like many who left reviews never made it to end of trail, its deceiving when you reach where trail stops at a bunch big rocks, but if you go across and up the trail picks back up, gets steep and difficult when snow/muddy. If you make up there you will find the other waterfall and beautiful views, at right time a day you can almost touch the clouds. Was great!"
53,2019-05-20,['hiking'],Fun trail. Not too steep or far and great views at the end. We did see a rattlesnake right next to the trail about 10 minutes in. 
54,2019-05-20,['hiking'],"Awesome right now, really green everywhere."
55,2019-05-19,['hiking'],"Gorgeous! The trail was fun and by the river the whole time! There is dedicated parking off the trail which is nice but walking up the neighborhood is a bit annoying. I recommend NOT going to the second waterfall. We tried to find it and couldn’t. If anything go up passed the main one and go down a bit off the trail, you’ll see a smaller pretty waterfall. But I didn’t see anything beyond that. It was mostly overgrown "
56,2019-05-19,"['hiking', 'scramble']","Really pretty, moderate hike. Mostly shaded. Nice waterfall. Slight rock scramble at the top for a nice view. "
57,2019-05-18,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky']","Gametrail!!!  We loved it, and were rewarded with great views and waterfalls!!!"
58,2019-05-16,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Amazing but wet and rattled snakes.
59,2019-05-13,['hiking'],This is a shady trail with a creek along side the entire time. It’s a bit steep going up in parts but has great views and worth your time.
60,2019-05-12,['hiking'],"Great hike along the water. The dogs love that for cooling off and I love it for the sound! I thought I would update the directions to the trail head since it’s not intuitive and past instructions were from the old parking area. After parking on Wasatch, head Straight up Canyon Cove (don’t turn right on Hughes Canyon Dr), left at Oak Canyon, right at Canyon Winds lane and walk straight until you head up someone’s driveway and you will see the trailhead."
61,2019-05-11,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
62,2019-05-10,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
63,2019-05-10,['hiking'],Really pretty trail and no snow. It felt a little more difficult than moderate but was still an enjoyable experience
64,2019-05-06,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Slight rock scramble to see view of waterfall and valley, not a lot of shaded areas, remember there is quite a bit of elevation gain in only 1.75 miles making this a slightly more difficult hike. Recommend bug spray and sunscreen always! Please respect neighborhood and park in designated spots out of the neighborhood, it’s not long at all to walk to the actual trailhead."
65,2019-05-06,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Great daytime hike! No snow, plenty of shade, and great photo ops! Somehow we lost the trail about midway, so we ended up at a bunch of walks overlooking the waterfall. That was a well-worn trail too, so maybe this happens to lots of people? Definitely worth an afternoon!"
66,2019-05-06,['hiking'],5/5 awesome trail! Not too busy on a Sunday afternoon. I found the trail that continues upward past the first waterfall. You have to climb further up through the rocks but you will eventually see the trail pick up. The trail gets steeper and unclear at some points but you will know you’ve made it once you start to see the flowers blooming. Beautiful view!
67,2019-05-05,['hiking'],Always a favorite quickie
68,2019-05-05,['hiking'],A great time to hike this trail. Butterflies everywhere. Everything is blooming.
69,2019-04-29,[''],Nice hike. Wasn't too busy earlier in the morning.
70,2019-04-29,['hiking'],"This one was an interesting hike. It starts at the parking lot then a climb through a neighborhood before getting to the trail. The trail is pretty sweet because there is a break off for the BST and then one for Heugh’s canyon. Our map on all trails said it was 3.5 and 1942 in elevation. Once we got to the main lookout (waterfall) we had hit about 2 miles and only 1200 ish feet so we knew there was more. . . So we kept going.. honestly if you do it I wouldn’t suggest going higher (unless you know where to go) the trail kind of gets lost and I didn’t see much of another *feature* of the hike other than more of the beautiful spring nature. Also your feet are most likely to get wet at this time of year, the trail follows the stream most of the way and it’s on the trail some of the way. Overall glad I got out and checked out the sweet waterfall and got to see some of my friends."
71,2019-04-26,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Super fantastic trail! I did not see in the comments that the trail is through a neighborhood. You’ll park before entering the neighborhood. Follow the water by taking a left and the a right. You’ll see a black driveway ahead with the trail. You’re hiking along water the entire time. Also, some parts you’re hiking in the water so wear good shoes. My dogs did incredible as well!"
72,2019-04-24,"['hiking', 'rocky']",4/23/2019 went up the trail in the evening and ended just at dark. What a great trail with flowing water and amazing outdoor views!! Had so much fun
73,2019-04-23,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Seems like not many folks go past the first rock pile/waterfall. A bit after that the trail is not so clear but after some backtracking, an edge-of cliff -walk, and what I would almost call climbing...we made it to the end (and boy was there a view! And a second waterfall) We definitely didn’t get to the end by following the red trail line, but tried to follow that on the way back and there are way too many loose rocks that it was quite dangerous up top. Made the cliff edge walk seem like the better way up/down the last bit. Great hike with lots of water and flowers this time of year. Very Friendly neighbors that we chatted with along the way."
74,2019-04-23,['hiking'],"Great conditions on 4/22. No snow. Some small stream crossings on trail. The waterfall is nice and full! Trout lilies in full bloom. A little tricky to find, no signs after parking lot on Wasatch Blvd. a friendly man in the neighborhood directed us where to go. You do have to cross what seems to be a private drive to start the trail."
75,2019-04-09,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Great hike! A little bit of a pain to get to at the beginning, but once you’re on the trail, it gets good! The creek is running pretty high as of 4/8/19 so there is some water spilling onto the trail at parts. You can only get about a 1/4 mile above the waterfall before you run into thick snow."
76,2019-04-06,"['hiking', 'snow']",This trail is beautiful. You hike along a creek most of the way. You pass two bridges and a boulder field with a waterfall and valley view. The trail today was a little damp with some areas where the creek is flowing over the trail. But overall easy to navigate through. There was some snow that prevented me from getting to the very top but I was close.
77,2019-04-05,['hiking'],"Just writing to say it’s pretty clear. There’s about 50 yds of snow past the first bridge, but then it clears up. About 1.5 mi up today the snow begins to cover most of the lay and ability to visually track the trail. Still beautiful waterfall and river for 90% of hike."
78,2019-03-31,['hiking'],Really beautiful views! Snows starting to melt so watch for water and maybe pack Yaks since the tops still a little slick.
79,2019-03-31,['hiking'],"Great hike. Very little snow, but you walk across a few streams so make sure you can keep your feet dry."
80,2019-03-26,['hiking'],Great little trail. I don’t mind walking through the neighborhood to get to it. Just follow the red line and you’ll be fine. Got about 1/4 mile past the falls but had to turn around cause I was sinking into the snow too much. Definitely coming back.
81,2019-03-21,['hiking'],As of 3/21 definitely still some snow about half way up but I didn’t need (or bring) my spikes. One iffy crossing of the creek but a makeshift bridge (3 small logs) gets you by.
82,2019-02-24,['hiking'],"Fun hike steep at the end, recorded 5.6 miles"
83,2019-02-12,"['hiking', 'private property', 'rocky', 'snow']",
84,2019-02-10,['hiking'],"Awesome little secret side canyon!!! This was such a fun exploration (especially in the winter). 

Just park on Wasatch Blvd just outside of that neighborhood and walk through it. 

You will need to walk on some dude's driveway (not illegal) in order to get there, but don't let that deter you! 

Keep on going past you the trail will soon come into view. 

This trail was beautiful and secluded. 

Got to the waterfall and the busted out the snowshoes to climb up another 1000 feet or so. 

Decided to turn back, but would want to come back this Summer or with a team of others and see how high we could get while being safe and cognizant of avalanches ...."
85,2019-01-21,['hiking'],"The only thing ""hard"" about this trail is finding it: navigating the 1/4 mile from the handful of parking spaces on Wasatch without any signage until you find the unmarked trailhead in a side cul de sac.

From there, it is lovely and moderate at best.  Trees/shade + streams/water are hard to find outside the watershed.  Apparently no one else was able to find the trail while I was up there, and I had it to myself.  It is not as steep or as exposed as Mt. Olympus.

It is frustrating to feel like a neighborhood is trying to keep a public trail from the public.  Once parked, I saw no signs (sorry to the person whose yard I traipsed through....I naively thought ""trailhead parking"" meant the trailhead was actually nearby).  The actual trailhead was up a private-ish road at the end of what totally felt like a private drive (maybe I actually traipsed through 2 people's yards?).  There was a big sign advertising property for sale at the trail, but no sign telling me I had arrived.  Although my dog and I enjoyed the 1/2 mile RT stroll on pavement through the neighborhood just to get to the trail (sarcasm), I can't imagine this is the best way to keep people from (gasp!) parking on the street in your neighborhood to go play in OUR backyard.

To everyone else, please enjoy this lovely trail!"
86,2018-10-31,[''],"Wouldn’t be the first or fifth trail I’d hike in the area, but bonus of it not being watershed. The people who live there that hate the trail access should have moved, oh, I don’t know, maybe not directly next to the Wasatch?"
87,2018-10-07,"['hiking', 'private property']",
88,2018-09-15,[''],This was a fun hike. Steep in some places especially at the end. I personally would not put this hike in the hard catigory. Waterfall is barely a trickle.
89,2018-09-03,[''],Great quick burner 4.4 miles up and back. Falls were a trickle this time of year but still beautiful. Trail mostly shaded for a good part of the day. Directions to trailhead took us a min so thought I’d share the real directions: Walk up Canyon cove drive . Left on Canyons wind lane. Right on Oak canyons drive.
90,2018-08-08,[''],It is a great trail
91,2018-08-07,['hiking'],"I live in the last house before the trail and let me tell you, we love that hikers use it! Some neighbors down the street are real strict about parking and we have been fighting to prevent a gate at the bottom of the street. there are lots of wasps on the trail (especially by the 2 water spots near the beginning of the hike) and occasionally a snake in the bushes. i take my small dog up there nearly every day and would say the bees are the only pests. It has some steep parts near the top with loose rock so be careful and go straight then right to see the waterfall when you reach the rock slide. Please pick up after your dogs and throw it in the bucket at the bottom of the trail and don't be shy, say hi if we're outside!"
92,2018-08-04,[''],"!!GETTING TO THE TRAILHEAD!!
you'll have to park on the east side of Wasatch Blvd. Then walk up canyon cove road, take your first left, then your first right up wind canyon rd, I believe. THEN you get to the teailhead. enjoy!"
93,2018-08-02,['trail running'],"Great burner trail run when you’re short on time. Be on the lookout for rattlesnakes tho, one at the top today right before the waterfall."
94,2018-07-26,[''],Pretty steep on the way up! Luckily didn’t see any rattle snakes. Loose rocks at the top so be careful where you step. I almost slipped and fell pretty far. But the views were well worth it! Got done in about and hour and fifteen

96,2018-06-26,['hiking'],"Trailhead is kind of hard to find. It is buried deep within a privileged McMansion neighborhood. Seemed like people built their fancy abodes directly around the trail, then got mad that hikers were trying to use the trail. Weird negative vibe. Description says “part of Oak Canyon Drive” is no parking. Hard to miss the 100+ no parking signs aligning the street. So I parked beneath them. Place was pretty empty. Started up the street with my old dog, when some kid called out to me.  Told me to move my car “no parking”. Even though I was below the signs and totally out of the way. Just weird to walk through a residential neighborhood and someone’s driveway to get to a trail. Anyhow, I get it fancy kid. Just trying to take a quick hike on a mellow evening. The place just had a weird negative vibe, then to be so rudely talked to. Yeah, I don’t need it."
97,2018-06-15,['hiking'],"I like this trail but it is quite overgrown at all times of the year. Two young rattlesnakes on the trail today, but it’s hard to watch your step in a lot of places. Keep your eyes open because you can hardly hear the young ones."
98,2018-06-15,[''],Great trail didn’t see a single hiker nice a and shaded most of the way with a little stream up the whole way my dog loved it! There is lots of bugs.
99,2018-06-14,[''],Very beautiful trail but the map/mileage needs to be updated since the trailhead is on Wasatch Blvd now.  We didn’t run into any snakes thank heavens but hiked it early before the sun was on the trail.  When you get to the boulder field go RIGHT- not up.  There was a cairn up high that led us to keep going up and it got extremely steep and we missed the falls.  We found it on the way down after some searching.  The trail end on this map is not where the falls are!  My Strava said 4 miles with 1400 ft elevation gain. Great hike though!
100,2018-06-11,['hiking'],"Rattlesnakes! About 100 yards up from where you leave the pavement my wife ahead of me got rattled at. I spotted it 14 inches above the trail so had to detour down below the trail to get around it. It was slightly bigger than a golf ball so a pretty good sized one. In informing others where it was two different groups alerted us to where they had encountered one and showed us pictures. One was just before the 2nd stream crossing, and one was on a log sunning its self. BE CAREFUL!

Lots of poison ivy this year also."
101,2018-06-11,['hiking'],"I wish I had read this before I went! I saw one of the rattlesnakes as I came back from the waterfall before I got back on the boulders. I grabbed my dog and got out as fast as I could. Otherwise, I loved the hike. I wouldn’t recommend for small dogs though as I had to hold my dog as we went across the boulders."
102,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"This had to be one of the best hikes I’ve been on in my long career of trail hunting. From the beautiful growth and vegetation leading up the trail, to the treacherous quest over boulders scaling up the Mtn to the tiny waterfall in the pocket of the canyon. Definitely a sight to see!"
103,2018-05-29,[''],Beautiful scenery and great hike. Bit of an incline but worth the hike and a rewarding beautiful waterfall.
104,2018-05-28,[''],Steep but great waterfall!
105,2018-05-26,['hiking'],"A bit tough, steep elevation gains but worth the views. Plus the water fall at the end is pretty cool"
106,2018-05-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike next to the mountain stream, awesome views of the valley, canyon, and the waterfall. It’s pretty steep! I found the rattlesnake in the first part of the rock fall between some boulders."
107,2018-05-21,['hiking'],"The City of Holladay, because of safety problems on Oak Canyon Drive, has moved the trailhead parking to Wasatch Boulevard and part of Oak Canyon Drive has been closed to parking. I've uploaded two photos showing the trailhead parking sign and no parking signs."
108,2018-05-21,['hiking'],Gradual steady incline all the way to the end of the hike. The view of the waterfall is very rewarding at the end.
109,2018-05-19,[''],"nice hike, well shaded  2 ft rattlesnake likes to hang out on the trail 20 steps past the foot bridge just before rock slide."
110,2018-05-17,['hiking'],"5/16/2018 Strenuous and rewarding, not forgiving at all. Being just a short distance into a neighborhood, it’s so secluded sheer minutes into the hike. Not many people on the trail, which is amazing. Will do again."
111,2018-05-17,['hiking'],Pretty strenuous hike due to the elevation gain in certain areas and towards the end you're scrambling on large rocks. The views are definitely beautiful though.
112,2018-05-10,['hiking'],"Beautilful hike, but steep for most of it. The views at the top are great though, and worth it if you are in decent shape. Once you cross the extremely rocky part of the trail, hike up until it levels out and that's the best view of the canyon.

The last 0.3 mile of the trail wasn't well trodden, and one of the steepest parts of the hike with no majestic views resulting at the end.  The rocky part was hard for my dogs to cross."
113,2018-05-09,['hiking'],"First rattlesnake of the season was spotted May 5th. Fortunately the lady who was ahead of me about 50 yards had her dog on a leash (a rare event), but boy did she scream! It eventually moved off the trail. The homeowners at the top of the private drive are providing a ""poop pail"". Sadly, not getting much usage."
114,2018-05-08,[''],"beautiful hike that wasn't crowded at all on a warm spring Saturday. very steep area towards the end before you reach the waterfall. if you decide to continue past the waterfall, the hike is very steep and rocky. there is a beautiful view just past the boulders and a fun mini waterfall to hang out and eat lunch by, but much further doesn't really lead to any destination point."
115,2018-05-07,['hiking'],"It was beautiful! There aren't many signs in the neighborhood below to figure out where to start. But it's pretty self explanatory.

It was amazingly green everywhere in the canyon. The trail is very steep the whole way there. It's only about 1.6 miles up but it took us almost an hour because of the elevation gain. The trail is skinny, and you can't see much with the trees, but once you get the the rock slide and waterfall it has an amazing view!

I would highly recommend it!"
116,2018-05-07,['hiking'],"Fun! Wear shoes you can get wet, lots of run off water. Gets steep at times but the waterfall is worth it. Boulders were kinda sketchy with the dogs but they seem to get the hang of it."
117,2018-05-07,['hiking'],"It was beautiful today! I would rate this hike as moderate, it only took us a little over an hour to get to the top but there were a few steep spots. You walk by the stream almost the whole way which was perfect for the pups! We did see one snake though ☹️ waterfall at the top is absolutely beautiful!"
118,2018-05-04,[''],"Great trail! I didn’t like having to go through a neighborhood and up someone’s drive way, but what can you do right?

The waterfall was spectacular, views were amazing, and as a reminder for everyone, LEASH YOUR DOGS!!!!!"
119,2018-04-30,['hiking'],"It's true there is no Bergdhalde Ln.  but it's easy to google the two connecting streets.  There is no parking any longer within the neighborhood along the streets closest to the trailhead.  Trail parking spaces have been created at the entrance of Canyon Cove  neighborhood along Wasatch, with a small sign stating this.  It's a steep but short two block walk to the trail head, which involves cutting along a private driveway right before the trail start. 

As far as the ""rock scramble"" mentioned in the comments, we headed straight across it (mostly half foot to foot tall flat surfaced rock from an ancient avalanche) which connected to the rest of the trail.  Just look for all the cairns.   This way does't take you down close to the largest waterfall in the stream, but you can also cut straight down the rock fall if you want.  Another large waterfall is encountered a short distance on the other side of the rocks, with many wildflowers in the rock wall crevasses above the stream and falls.  Really pretty this time of year.  We saw at least 6 kinds of wild flowers but missed out on all the snake action.  There was one small patch of snow in the shade, but the trail was mostly dry, otherwise.  The next day it rained and snow flurried, so I'm sure that has changed.   

Half the dogs were not leashed and of course, a bit of bagged and unbagged poop was found on the trail.  Not cool."
120,2018-04-29,['hiking'],Great hike. When to get the rock scramble at the end make your way sharply to the right where the waterfall is located. Just follow your ears.
121,2018-04-28,[''],"Trail itself is maybe 5 stars but one star off because you have to cut through a residential neighborhood to get there. 

Lots of neat terrain and views. A great stream the whole way. When you get to the boulders you have to find a path across because the trail goes another quarter mile or so beyond and it’s worth the trip."
122,2018-04-23,[''],"Nice trail, very few people.  Rocky in places but worth the trip for sure"
123,2018-04-20,['hiking'],"Fun short hike. The boulder field at the end is confusing, but stick to the low part of it to reach the falls, though the middle/upper portion makes for an incredible view!"
124,2018-04-01,['hiking'],"This hike is very steep, and there’s some scrambling at the end, but it’s worth it. It’s along a stream the whole way, and the waterfall at the top is gorgeous. Loved it!"
125,2017-11-01,['hiking'],"This trail isn’t bad but its more of a warm up hike for another hike , its a good trail until you get to the wooden bridge, then its a steep climb for 200 yards or so then the trail sorta ends"
126,2017-10-30,[''],"Great Trail! Beautiful all year long, and never ceases to leave you winded on the uphill!!
One thing to note, the trail head is no longer at the base of Berghalde Ln. It has been developed, and Berghadle Ln no longer exists. You must park and the bottom of Canyon Winds Lane and walk up the road in order to access the trail head."

128,2017-10-06,[''],Amazing trail!
129,2017-08-19,[''],Not as scenic as I thought. Usually see at least 1 rattlesnakes when I hike the trail.
130,2017-08-07,[''],"Awesome summer hike to a hidden waterfall! My GPS clocked the distance at only 2.7 miles RT, but it's a nice little hike for after work or a quick weekend getaway. The waterfall is lovely, and cold. Just what you need when it's oppressively hot in the valley. I did see two Rattlers on this trail --both were quote big."
131,2017-07-31,['hiking'],Such a beautiful hike! We went early in the morning and didn't see any rattle snakes however we were extra cautious on the boulders. Its fairly steep here and there but overall not a strenuous hike. One of my new favorites!
132,2017-07-22,[''],waterfall is a nice treat on a hot day
133,2017-07-13,['hiking'],Need to finish this one!
134,2017-07-12,['hiking'],Awesome hike! it starts out pretty moderate and gets tougher the further you go up. Watch your step though I had to avoid a small Rattler this morning.
135,2017-07-07,['hiking'],"Too bad their isn't an option to have 6 stars because this hike definitely deserves it. This is my all time favorite hike in the Wasatch Mountains, it is so incredibly beautiful it cannot be described. It's only steep in a few spots but for the most part pretty easy. I have done hiked it about 10 times and don't get bored of it. There's a cave and a water fall and plenty of gorgeous views!"
136,2017-07-01,['hiking'],"Really great hike. was beautiful in the morning,  lots of shaded trail. Just a bit of mild rock scrambling just before you can get to the waterfall. Steep enough to get your heart rate up a little but also pretty enough to take slow if you need or want too. Loved it. plan on doing it again soon!"
137,2017-06-30,['hiking'],I enjoyed this trail tremendously. Three of us went about 6:00 am and it was very pleasant. You can take dogs but near the waterfall it is a bit of scrambling rock to rock. A dog may or may not have a little trouble there. we did see a dead snake as well they are in the area but don't seem to be a deterrent but merely something of which to be cognizant.
138,2017-06-07,[''],"Great follow the carn dog trail, gets steep after the waterfall. It's mostly shaded with a nice stream at least in early summer."
139,2017-06-05,['hiking'],"Beautiful and diverse. Trail is easy to follow, even past the rock field for a ways if you can follow the cairns. As you keep going after the rock field the trail seems to taper off, at least for what AllTrails marks as where the trails goes. Saw a rattlesnake directly on the trail as I was coming down, me and another guy had to coax it off, be very careful on this trail!"
140,2017-06-02,[''],"It was beautiful, but a rattlesnake was waiting for us at the top!"
141,2017-05-27,[''],
142,2017-05-25,['hiking'],Cairns mark the way.  Except near end.  Not sure if we made it or not.  Either way it was cool.
143,2017-05-22,['hiking'],The end was a little sketchy with the scrambling on the boulders but it was a great hike.  My 8 year old daughter loved it.  It took us 3 hours.
144,2017-05-17,['walking'],Good spot.
145,2017-05-14,[''],Wild flowers are plentiful right now. Mostly shaded. Some water on trail but not much mud.
146,2017-05-14,['hiking'],Just did this trail yesterday and loved it. Flowers are starting to pop up and the entire trail is covered in green. The trails is a little slippery on the way down.
147,2017-05-03,['hiking'],great hike for dogs. Lots of really diverse terrain. Different spots to explore.
148,2017-04-30,['backpacking'],Also great for dogs
149,2017-04-19,[''],Attempted to do this hike with my dog but it is not clearly marked so I turned around due to time. Might be a nice hike all the way up but I am an inexperienced hiker and did not want to go off trail
150,2017-04-12,[''],"This was my first time hiking this trail. You have to park at the bottom of the neighborhood and walk to the hike, which is along someone's house, and the trail begins. It was a super nice day, about 70 degrees, beginning of April, but the hike was a little rough since the trees were still dead, it got pretty hot. I wouldn't rate this as hard, more moderate (just because of the heat, there is an incline but it's doable) 

 My dogs loved it, especially since there was a creek they got to play in the whole way up. Once you reach the top you have to climb across some boulders to get too the waterfall. I brought along rain boots so I could walk closer to the waterfall and enjoy it with out the freezing cold water. I would recommend this hike!"
151,2017-03-27,[''],Barely any snow left! Check out the cool cave about a mile up on the left of the trail. Visible from the trail. Steady incline the entire trail - pace yourself.
152,2016-09-22,['hiking'],"Did this hike September 20th. The trail was easy to follow all the way. Steady incline all the way up with awesome boulders to cross at one point. A couple areas have loose rocks & dirt so hiking shoes are much better than tennis shoes. Beautiful fall colors & views of the valley. The stream was just a trickle, will be nice to try next year earlier in the season to see the water. Really enjoyed the hike!"
153,2016-08-20,[''],"Sara Gibson was right! This hike was a nice, short, challenging hike."
154,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"Another steep canyon hike. We tackled this hike in Mid June, as the plants grow it can get a little overgrown. It is shaded! Follows a small stream. Dogs are allowed. It is difficult going up and down with areas of gravel and lose dirt. It is tricky to find the start point as the trail head begins between two homes. A great after work hike during the summer."
155,2016-07-20,['hiking'],"Nice hike.  Strenuous for 11, 9 and 6 yo but they enjoyed it."
156,2016-07-17,['hiking'],The trail has a nice steady incline but gets very overgrown in places which wasnt very pleasant.  Might be better in the Fall when the vegetation gets less.  The stream alongside was great.
157,2016-07-06,['hiking'],Nice trail relatively Steepwith lots of vegetation and a beautiful waterfall near the top
158,2016-07-02,['hiking'],"Today, July 2, we saw a lot of butterflies and pill bugs. Luckily we didn't see any snakes and there were plenty wild raspberries, birds and squirrels, but not many flowers.
I recommend wearing long pants and long sleeves. This trial is a bit over grown and if you don't recognize poison oak or poison ivy, it might behoove you to take this precaution. 
The trail is a steady incline, I'm a little overweight but it's doable. I also saw some older ladies 50-60s. It's kid friendly for 7+ and up.
Note, leave no trace. If you or your dog make a potty stop, pick up, clean up, carry out....including tissue paper ladies!!
Happy hiking!!!"
159,2016-07-01,['hiking'],Beautiful. Steady incline on the way in but nothing too intimidating. Some bouldering  over rocks and you're suprised by a really incredible view.
160,2016-06-16,[''],"The hike was beautiful and following the brook the whole time was great! A bit steep but doable. We got lost and didn't see the waterfall destination on the way up because the trail continues, so I wanted to write this to make sure no one else does this (we weren't the only ones on the trail that kept going thinking there was more). You will cross the stream in 2 places, and the 2nd crossing has a little bridge. Shortly after this you will come to a boulder field, and the waterfall is on your right! Stay low on the boulder field until you run into a rock wall, and shimmy across that rock wall along the stream to get to the base of the waterfall! If you keep going you can climb all the way up to mount Olympus on this trail, although this is the difficult way up!"
161,2016-06-15,['backpacking'],Chill hike and beautiful scenery
162,2016-06-12,['hiking'],"Great hike: shade most of the way, aromatic wildflowers, a brook running along whole trail, very few people, beautiful waterfall at end."
163,2016-06-06,['hiking'],This hike was so beautiful. It was a bit hard at the beginning but once you get going it's fine. There was plenty of shade which was nice because we went during the day. There are some beautiful waterfalls.
164,2016-06-04,['hiking'],"This hike is beautiful. Mostly shaded the entire way. It is however steep the whole way and super steep in spots. To get to the actual waterfall there's a scramble over boulders to see it. You'll want to stay low on the boulders for easiest access.  The fall itself is beautiful!

All in all, the end result is an amazing reward to this hike!"
165,2016-06-04,[''],Good Hike. Not many people in it either. It is a steep hike for most of it.
166,2016-05-31,['hiking'],"At first when I read it's ""hard"" I kind of laughed, oh boy was I wrong! Even though it's not that long it's has incline the minute you get on the trail. I'm not the most active person though, maybe this will be moderate to some. I just kept wishing after one hill, after thee other it would get easier and flat for me to catch my breath. So do prep for this hike! It's nice, and shaded for the most part. Nice creek along the side.

It does get a little confusing when you get to the boulders, there is a path for you to actually see the waterfall up close. you have to get close to the bottom and when you hit into the biggest rock next to the waterfall there's a small pathway to walk through and see the waterfall. I hope that makes sense."
167,2016-05-30,[''],"This is a very kid friendly hike and it is quite lush and green this time of year. some pretty flowers, a couple of stream crossings and little waterfalls. We came across a rattlesnake who was very quick to let us know we were near."
168,2016-05-30,[''],"Nice short, but gets you sweating, hike! The waterfall at the end is worth it!"
169,2016-05-24,['hiking'],Love this hike.
170,2016-05-20,['hiking'],Steep and shaded with a waterfall at the end. Dogs allowed and fun things to see along the way.
171,2016-05-16,[''],Loved this trail! Absolutely breathtaking.
172,2016-05-12,['hiking'],"Great Hike! We had kids as young as 7 up there and it went great. Push through the Bolder Field to see the waterfall, it's worth it!"
173,2016-04-28,['hiking'],Love the waterfall!
174,2016-04-20,['hiking'],Where is parking if you want to do this trail?
175,2016-04-17,['trail running'],"Cute little trail with a good mix of sun and shade.  The 3.2 miles is round trip so just over 1.5 miles upwards climb.  The first half of the upwards follows the stream which is pretty and nice to listen to. You cross over twice, once on some logs, again on a small bridge.  You cross two rock slide areas.  The first is large rocks and the trail continues just a little higher up from where you entered.  The second is smaller rocks and dodgier.  Just pass the second rock slide is a small grassy opening / overlook.  I kept going and do not recommend it.  I'm sure its possible but the only ""trail"" options I saw were steep strong brush with loose dirt or steep small unstable rocks in the slide.  And yes, do not let the ""private drive"", ""no unauthorized vehicles"", ""no parking"" signs or the car purposely parked to block you, discourage you from checking it out."
176,2016-04-11,['hiking'],"Nice trail with plenty of things to see along the way like caves, huts and wild flowers. Moderately steep climb so bring hydration and proper footwear."
177,2016-03-20,[''],"It was beautiful out today! Went in the afternoon, not too many people. You can go past all the rocks at what seems like the end and check out more trail, see the waterfall, take in the views! It was a fun outing!"
178,2015-11-07,['hiking'],As mention previously the trail starts up a driveway. Its a very good trail for most of the 2 miles up. There are a couple of rock slides where finding the trail on the other side takes a few extra minutes. 2 miles in the trail climbs steeply and becomes difficult to follow. We ran out of time so we were not able to determine it the trail continued any further. Started at first light so we watched the sun hit the Oquirrh Mountains and creep  across the valley
179,2015-05-04,['hiking'],"Trailhead access does feel dodgy, as you're walking over that driveway to get to it. 
In recent years, poison ivy has taken over almost the entire trail. Two years ago, there were little patches of it, but last year in September, it was thick! I'd never been susceptible to urushiol before, but it got me that time. I like this hike a lot, but won't do it again because of the poison ivy.

It's pretty consistently steep and shaded, with great views of the rocks and valley once you get higher up. Above the talus field is a lovely resting spot with a waterfall, fire spot, and lots of flat ground to sprawl out on. Higher up, the trail peters out, but you can bushwhack and get a lot higher if you want to.
It's generally very sparsely populated with people, which is a good thing."
180,2015-04-30,[''],"Amazing variety of landscape! A couple of springs (but very muddy water so I wouldn't try drinking it), a cave, a waterfall, wild flowers, good views all the way up. It's an awesome afternoon hike. My dad was the architect for the house at the trailhead so he was the one that suggested it to me. #barosdesign lol. Amazing hike"
181,2015-04-19,['hiking'],"I like this new hike I found! Decent variety- surrounded by foliage yet receive sunlight probably half of the time. Along a stream for majority of the time. At one point it's a wall of boulders and you have to do some scrambling, nothing too bad though. Slightly challenging climb at times but broken up, not making it too difficult. Beautiful views!

Park below Canyons Winds Lane (on Oak Canyon Dr) and walk up the lane. Access trail via very top house. You'll feel like you're walking up someone's driveway but it's a legal pass way and the trail head is right there."
182,2014-09-18,['hiking'],"If you work nearby and have an hour to spare, this is a decent hike. Thanks to the first reviewer for pointing out the parking restrictions (Don't park on Canyon Woods Ln.) park and way to get to trail-head (through driveway of home). The trail is narrow, but obvious with a gradual incline and partly shaded. There was a small stream that had water in some places but not others. Not too colorful for a mid September walk, but maybe it will get better in a few weeks. Only a few good views of the valley, the first and probably best view is only about 1/2 mile up the trail. First obvious camping area about 1.25 miles up, just below the trail (small trail leads to it). I only made it to the rock slide area (about 1.5 miles), apparently there is another campsite up further. The rocks were loose in some places and I wasn't interested in twisting an ankle (or meeting any rattlesnakes also from from review). A lot of steep rock faces viewable throughout the hike, some coming to the edge of the trail. There are no trail signs anywhere that I saw, and the inconvenience of getting on the trail dropped my rating of the trail. The canyon itself is beautiful."
183,2014-07-08,['camping'],"The trail starts off in some guys drive way... Weird... You have to park at the bottom of the street to get to the trailhead because he won't let anyone park in the circle near his house. Understandable but kinda douchey. 
    We backpacked up during the middle of the day. It was miserably hot. Luckily we had alota shade, there are a lot of trees on both sides of the trail. The trail is steep, every step is on an incline. I can't remember on flat spot. 
   We setup camp next to the stream, and began to hike down again because we saw a cave off to the north east side of the trail. We went inside the cave and it was very shallow. Kinda fun to go in, not a must see on this hike. 
   We hiked back up passed our camp, the trail ends at a rock slide area where you can walk across big boulders to get up higher. Off to the right there is a waterfall which is fun to go see. We saw 5 rattlesnakes the whole time we were up by the rocks. No where else. 
  If you climb up higher on the rocks there is a start to another trail that leads to another campsite. If you have the energy and strength to get your gear up there, I recommend it. It's a nice campsite, flat and close to the stream. Lots of room to sit around the campfire. 
 I'd definitely do this hike again, make sure you bring enough water, and of course a snack. Keep your eyes up, and be careful of those rattlers."
