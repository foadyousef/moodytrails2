0,2019-08-29,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'washed out']",I took the upper trail this time. A beautiful hike through the scrub oak. Very steep. Significant erosion in many places. Would be better with switchbacks instead of going straight up the mountain. Didn’t see any snakes but saw 8 lizards and countless grasshoppers. Minimal shade—take lots of water! Would have given it 5 stars if it were in better shape and not as damaging to the natural landscape. 
1,2019-08-21,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'scramble']","A very peaceful trail. All the washed out bridges are back in place. Crossed the stream several times but never got my feet wet. At some points the soil was loose and footing was sketchy. Didn’t see any snakes. Just after the 2mile point (per the MapMyRun app) the trail became pretty hard to follow. I stopped when I got to the top of a granite boulder and came back. This trail definitely needs some attention to make it more accessible and safe. Some of the bridges could be refurbished and reinforced. Overall, a lot of fun and very peaceful. "

3,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'over grown']",This was a very very fun trail! We were on horse back and didn’t make it all the way in due to a very steep downside with very large boulders. Thankfully we have very trusting horses that were able to get us turned around! was insane! Very good workout for the horses though! It’s not for the weak hearted for sure! 
4,2019-08-03,['hiking'],This trail you get to remember what it is like to be a kid and explore different possibilities. At some times you need to seek the right way to keep going. It’s an adventure. 
5,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'off trail', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'washed out']",The main trail has been over grown to the point where your can give your sells off the main trail easily. there are snakes in the Rocky outcroppings look out for that. also tics are common especially if you end up off the main trail. the river is nice and refreshing but definitely has Leeches be careful. 
6,2019-07-19,"['hiking', 'muddy']","The trail was a little bit hard to follow towards the end as it got narrow and a little muddy, but we did also go after it had just rained. It was absolutely beautiful and my 4 month old puppy loved it and was able to do it just fine. The water has been too high to cross the first bridge In the spring but now its low enough to be able to get over it. Anticipate your shoes getting a little wet. "
7,2019-07-11,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'washed out']","I would like to call this trail the hike through hell but I think hell would be more scenic. Trail is overgrown, no real waterfalls, muddy and trail becomes very undefined at times. I would not recommend this trail to anyone...even Satan. "
8,2019-07-08,[''],"Have hiked this trail a few times but this was my first snow hike on this trail.  Only made it up to the big rock with moss about 2 miles and didn't dare follow the foot prints that were heading to the left and almost straight up since I was by myself.  I wore my ice spikes.  A good workout,  gets the heart rate up.  Crossing over the logs was easier becuase the snow was packed on them.   Very beautiful in the winter snow.  One day I will hopefully make it to the waterfall that everyone is talking about.  Poles or walking stick it very helpful anytime of year for crossing the creek."

11,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'bridge out']","The greenery is gorgeous and shady, but there are some issues. There are a few river crossings, and the bridges are really sketchy so my friends and I decided to just walk in the water. It is definitely a hard hike. Very steep. We got too tired after a mile and turned back. There is a cool place to boulder/climb on so that was fun, but I wouldn't do the hike again."
12,2019-06-30,['hiking'],please anyone up the way of the bountiful B on any road or trail and camping be on lookout for a 13 yr old deaf blind (he has blue eyes due to his severe cataracts) and only couple teeth in back usually his tongue sticks out too. hes white/ tan; looks like a little white fox with his ears erect and has longer nails right now cause he was lost before we came back home to cut them ill post pics in the pics section hopefully alive but if deceased as well please send me pics to confirm or deny its the correct pup. me and his (osiris ) siblings are home for a day and a half then will be back up tomorrow afternoon at our camp site of FR 807 where we had been. there's pics posted and signs at our site and all along ward canyon rd 
13,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'off trail', 'over grown', 'scramble', 'washed out']","Gorgeous hike with tons of water, shade, and wildlife. We saw the cutest baby raccoon mewing in a tree. Also spotted a long fat rattle snake and a couple of deer. The “hard” rating seems a bit off. It’s moderate- similar to the Desolation Lake trail. 
One question: WHERE DOES THE TRAIL END??? We turned back about 3.5 miles in at the pipeline clearing. Never made it above the tree line and missed the elusive ridge. 
The trail is washed out and overgrown, as others have mentioned, but the water crossings added to the adventure! "
14,2019-06-12,[''],"Great hike! The water was running high. We didn't come prepared and stopped at the first bridge then turned back. Came across a baby rattlesnake which scared my 6 year old. Overall, it was a fun hike. "
15,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'muddy', 'over grown', 'rocky']","Cool trail, very shady and secluded. All the bridges were down or underwater, crossed the river 9 times in 3 miles. Most crossings were knee deep and fast but passible. 

We never found any end to the trail. Around mile 3 it started getting extremely overgrown with a lot of blowdown so we turned back a bit past the pipeline access at 3.5 miles. 

Definitely not a trail for kids until the water level drops. Plan on getting your feet wet. Wear long pants/sleeves if you want to hike more than 2.5 miles up, which is definitely worth it in my opinion. 

Saw one (maybe) rattlesnake below the trail on a large rock, watch your dogs. "
16,2019-06-05,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'muddy']",Awesome hike. Most of the bridges we came to had been washed away. The water was moving pretty good so I had to carry or help the 2 kids and 3 dogs cross. We came to a spot the water was too crazy and had to turn around. Andddd when we made it back to the truck... someone had broke in and stole my wallet and had $1600 charged by the time I talked to my bank. 
17,2019-06-03,['hiking'],"This a great hike when it’s hot. Lots of shade and water. Not a lot of people on a Monday, I’ll be bringing my dogs back for sure."
18,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'over grown', 'washed out']",Trail gets a little narrow.  Trail stops at the first water crossing.  Bridge is under water and can only cross by crossing a slippery log and branches.
19,2019-05-27,[''],"Amazing trail that is along the river the entire way. You have to cross the  river quite a bit, so get ready to be wet."
20,2019-05-27,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'over grown', 'washed out']","Would love to come back in the fall! We made it to the end, but no one made it with dry feet."
21,2019-05-13,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'over grown', 'washed out']",
22,2019-05-12,['hiking'],We ran into a bridge underwater which looked pretty slippery and we decided to wait a couple more weeks for the water to subside. But this is our favorite hike and we love hiking all the way up across the rivers and trying to see how far we can get up.
23,2019-05-02,['hiking'],"May 2019. 

Due to the increase of water, there are places where the bridges are either moved or don’t extend far enough. So depending on the size of dog pooches will have to walk or swim across. Humans could probably walk on tree trunks and not ever get wet, but may have to take a few steps in the water. So worth it though!!!"
24,2019-04-25,"['trail running', 'bridge out', 'muddy', 'snow']","Good trail. There are many river crossings some with bridges, some without, or they're underwater. Trail completely socked in with snow at 2.2 miles up. This one's a calf burner, especially early in your season!"

26,2019-02-16,['hiking'],"Fun little hike just behind the LDS Bountiful temple. 

I love the feel of the Bountiful canyons!

This was a fun one to explore. 

Need to come back with the dogs . . ."
27,2018-09-24,['hiking'],Such a nice hike up with the dogs and family!  Such a beautiful hike and love the creek for the dogs!
28,2018-09-10,['hiking'],"I hiked with my Boy Scout troop up to the pipeline, which I believe is about 2.5 miles in. According to another group of hikers we met, the trail gets very overgrown past this point. As previous reviewers have noted, the trail is shaded most of the way by scrub oak, maple, cottonwood and tall pines. Overall, it was a beautiful hike, and a good workout."
29,2018-08-25,['trail running'],"This hike is mostly shaded and great for hiking, trail running, or snowshoeing. Never too busy either!"
30,2018-08-17,[''],Incredible trail you get back in the thick of things cross the river several times and if you like to get away from things this is a great trail. A lot of up and down and steep in places but so worth it.
31,2018-08-17,[''],Great dog trail. But watch out for poison ivy.
32,2018-08-16,['hiking'],I’ve lived in N Salt Lake on the east bench for 3 years and this is the first crack at this trail. You should probably read the reviews before you set out on this one. It’s a relatively challenging hike at times but offers a lot of stream access and not too difficult for the first mile. Apparently the end (what I believe was the common end) is right around the clear cut area which is just under 3 miles in. I pressed on for another quarter mile and at that point there were several jogs that were completely overgrown. It was kinda cool to push through thick brush and also added to the challenge. It got late in the afternoon and I turned around but will return and press on because there’s got to be more of a payoff than that clear cut area.
33,2018-08-16,[''],Great dog trail
34,2018-07-21,['hiking'],This is a great trail! It was a little overgrown in places but not bad. I would recommend it!
35,2018-07-04,['hiking'],Really like this trail.   Watch for rattle snakes tho
36,2018-07-04,[''],"My husband and I completed this hike on July 1.

This hike was okay. Typical canyon hike- lovely views and mostly shaded. Frustrating  that the trail was overgrown in some areas, especially toward the end. We're not even sure we made it to the official end of the trail... we just couldn't go any farther. 

Probably would've given it 3 stars, but the stream crossings and clusters of butterflies were redeeming factors."
37,2018-07-02,[''],great hike :)
38,2018-06-24,[''],"Fun and gorgeous hike! There is poison ivy along the trail, so be aware of that, but otherwise a very nice trail."
39,2018-06-21,[''],One of my favorite hikes. love the water and the bridges.
40,2018-06-04,[''],"Great trail, beautiful scenery."
41,2018-06-02,[''],Great hike for families with young kids. Fun to play in the creek along the way.
42,2018-05-05,['hiking'],There are two trails here apparently . One that goes above the parking lot and one that goes below into the canyon. We did the latter. Great family friendly trail. You will cross a couple creeks and rivers but there are bridges over the creeks and the river is currently still calm enough to walk through. Beautiful trees everywhere and lots of shade . There are a couple steep hills.
43,2018-03-11,['hiking'],"Great trail! We have an issue finding trails where my pup can come that aren’t an hour out. So this was a great beautiful local hike for us that we’ll do many more times! It doesn’t have a super clear ending. But we joked about 6 Miles total. Going back and forth with the creek was great. We went with a little melting snow, I’d imagine spring and fall are beautiful!"
44,2017-11-19,[''],"The trailhead for Holbrook Canyon is across the street from the Bountiful Temple.  While there is no spectacular destination at the end of the trail and it is very similar to many other canyon trails along the Wasatch Front, it is a very enjoyable hike.  This trail has many stream crossings, many of which have small bridges and the rest are possible to cross without getting wet as long as you can balance on rocks or logs.  There are several sections of the trail that are wet and muddy.  The trees provide shade most of the way.  The hike does have many short steep climbs and at times there are some steep slopes that fall away from the trail and go down to the river with no railings.  Near the top of the trail bushes have grown over parts of the trail.  Pants are of benefit if you want to do the last half mile of the trail.  The trail peters out after about 3 miles.  Some of the best things about this trail is there are lots of nice places to camp.  I noticed about 4 spots with tent sites and fire pits and saw several others that would work as well.  There are also deer in the canyon.  I saw about 6 near the top of the canyon.  There are several large rock sections that would be fun to climb around on and explore.  The river is very relaxing and beautiful and only makes the camping sites even better."
45,2017-10-17,['hiking'],"Fall!  What a wonderful season to hike this Trail. Mid-hike (about the waterfall,) the canyon narrows, trail was icy making river fords (log and rock crossings) much more tricky, and I would say the most technical part of the trail. Definitely less traveled and more overgrown from ""the falls"" on up to ""pipeline path,"" but still very evident and passable, with the canyon opening back up and making travel eaiser, but still muddy in spots.  AFTER ""pipeline path,"" trail obviously continues eastward, higher up canyon on (south side of creek,) but CONSIDERABLY more overgrown, so I turned back."
46,2017-10-16,['hiking'],Great hike by the little creek. Second half of the trail is a little over grown and muddy. But still pretty awesome trail!
47,2017-10-15,[''],Very beautiful !
48,2017-10-15,[''],"loved this hike. It wasn't super hard but beautiful. It does get a little technical when there's a lot of water,  but totally worth it. not a bad hike."
49,2017-10-07,['hiking'],Tons of horse dung; I passed a group of 10 horses while hiking today. Had to stop at 3 miles due to overgrowth but the trail should continue at least one more mile to a waterfall/pool according to the Davis County Trail Map.
50,2017-09-25,[''],"This is my favorite hike in Northern Utah. I love how you're walking a long a creek the whole time. It is very hard to get lost. In the 20+ times I have hiked it, I have yet to see a snake."
51,2017-08-18,['horseback riding'],Beautiful but in need of some trail cleanup and repair
52,2017-08-13,[''],Beautiful if you want to get lost on a nice valley hike
53,2017-08-05,[''],"This is a great summer hike. I wore hiking sandals and waded in the cold stream that weaves through trail. Not really very hard, but walking sticks are helpful."
54,2017-08-03,['trail running'],Ran an out and back for a total of 5.3 miles. Trail was very pretty and enjoyable up to about 2 miles into the canyon. Trail then became obnoxiously overgrown to the point where running was no longer possible. Ended up turning around at the pipeline clearing because we couldn't find where the trail continued. Fantastic trail if you intend on keeping it under 3 or 4 miles. No rattlesnake sightings for us.
55,2017-07-26,[''],"Cloud cover was great. Nice, easy hike. Good family hike. Lots of shade"
56,2017-07-23,[''],I like the amount of shade and how much you're by the river. Ideal for our super furry dogs. Very beautiful as well and no Mountain Bikers.
57,2017-07-15,['hiking'],"My brother and I went on a 2 hour hike up Holbrook Canyon. We went for 4.8 miles and came back. There is a very steep part 2/3 of the way through where we had to climb on our hands and knees, there is also a empty mine tunnel of the trail. It was fantastic!!!!"
58,2017-07-12,['hiking'],"Great hike, very beautiful and shady.  We followed the stream.  I had my 10,7 and baby in backpack.  We only got a mile or so in and turned around.  It was their favorite hike!  Although, beware of rattlesnakes.  My son almost stepped on one.  We also saw a skunk cross the trail.  Adventure!"
59,2017-07-08,['hiking'],
60,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Awesome hike!  Will exert a lot of energy to get to the top!

It is rated difficult so I don't understand the reviews saying the trail isn't maintained, it is steep, or they got weed whacked----and then rating it poorly---it is what it is, a fun but exerting hike!  

Best part of hike was very few people!  The views!  The creek!

Started out being careful to not get wet...by the end we were just avoiding all the bridges bc the water felt so great!

Dogs loved it!"
61,2017-06-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful natural area, with wildflowers and the pretty Holbrook Creek. But this trail is not well maintained, with several sections where you have to climb over downed trees, wade through the creek, or scrape through overgrowth. I almost stepped on a rattlesnake on the way back; be careful!"
62,2017-06-05,[''],"Just hiked this trail yesterday (May 31, 2017). Beautiful views and secluded. However, beware, we saw two large rattlesnakes on the trail. I'd avoid bush wacking. We did see a badger and a hiker we met saw moose the week before. The creek is very high and fast right now with the run off. Lots of fairly challenging creek crossings. Definitely bring a walking stick to aid your crossings and be prepared to get wet. Totally worth it, though."
63,2017-06-01,[''],Nice trail up and down lots of water. You will get wet. Went up like 12 miles. Ran out of trail and kept going. Saw elephant rock and the pipeline. I never saw a waterfall? Has anyone here seen it? Is it of the trail? The app says it does and no one on here has seen it. Any tips?! I have gone past where most people stop and saw no waterfall.
64,2017-05-29,['walking'],Pretty hike along the creek. The creek was very full on Memorial Day and overtook the trail at places. This hike has multiple creek crossings. Plan on getting wet! We went 3.2 miles up the trail. Carried a six month with the carrier and it wasn't too difficult. Not very steep. Never saw the waterfall. Did enjoy the creek though.
65,2017-05-24,['hiking'],"Water level still pretty high so most of the crossings are still underwater. Had to trudge through the creek in multiple places.  The canyon itself is beautiful but the higher up on the trail you get, it get's in really bad shape being really overgrown and covered in lots of debris and downed trees/branches from winter so I got pretty scraped up. Still a fun hike though."
66,2017-05-13,['hiking'],"The river is running high, fast, muddy and cold. Crossed it many times because all of the bridges were washed out or under water. The river was running down the trails that ran next to the river. The water was so cold even the bottom of my feet hurt. You might want to wait for the water level to goes down"
67,2017-05-10,['hiking'],"Great Trail!!! My kids and I have hiked it 3 times now, they were 3 and 7 the first time and had basically 0 difficulty until after the last Creek pass, then it goes all uphill. About a week ago the creek passings were pretty much just water, the run off makes it look like a river!! Good trail though, it's one of our favorites!!"
68,2017-05-07,['walking'],It's awesome
69,2017-05-06,[''],"Fun trail, I'm not an avid hiker, but this was really fun"
70,2017-05-04,['hiking'],"5/3/17 - The trail starts out nice. Good rolling ups and downs. The river and bridges are fun. At a couple of points higher up, it's easy to lose the trail because of overgrowth and junk that's come down the mountain from winter. A lot of rigid overgrowth scratched up my legs real good. 1/5th of the trail is a small stream this time of year from runoff. Towards the end the trail got lost completely. I trudged ahead a bit to see if it picked up again but no avail. Marked my GPS and it turns out I was about 300-400 feet from the end."
71,2017-05-01,['hiking'],"We hiked up for 30 minutes then turned around. Had a 5, 2, 7 month old and we loved the bridges!"
72,2017-04-23,[''],
73,2017-04-23,['hiking'],"This was a good trail with a good mix of challenges, and easy spots. Water crosses the trail quite often, which adds a bit of fun and beauty to this trip. My son came with me, and he's a can-do, new, and excited hiker. He had so much fun, but we both got tired about 1.7 miles up! We headed back down after that. We got to see a little snake near one of the places water crossed the trail, and a small lizard too. Bring snacks and water!"
74,2017-04-06,[''],"I'm not sure why this trail is rated ""hard"". It's a little lenghty but I found it super easy considering the distance. It seems about as flat as a canyon trail can get. Maybe it's considered hard because you have to cross the river multiple times and people don't like to get their feet wet, I don't know. I loved it and my dogs loved it. I would highly recommend this trail."
75,2017-03-10,[''],Still lots of snow after the first mile.  Sunk to my waist a couple times.  Bring snowshoes.
76,2016-10-22,['hiking'],"Hard. October, lots of moisture. Have hiking shoes. Went up like 10 miles ran out of trail. Saw elephant rock and the pipeline. No waterfall. Hard past 5 miles. Thick vegetation."
77,2016-09-08,[''],"Great hike, 6,5mies to the pipeline- you can hear the stream most of the way- mostly shaded. Four legged pooches really had fun."
78,2016-07-23,['trail running'],"A nice, calm journey. I don't think it should be considered ""hard."""
79,2016-07-14,['hiking'],This is a nice hike if you do it around 8am it's shaded all the way.
80,2016-07-10,[''],there is a stream you follow some of the way.
81,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"One of the most beautiful trails I've done. We took the lower trail so it was very shaded and followed along the creek. It was a pretty hard trail when you're carrying a 40 pound backpack occupied by a toddler. We only made it one mile in before turning around. We took our 6 and 9 year old and they loved it. But it's definitely not a trail I'd do with younger kids than that. Even though it was beautiful, it was indeed a very steep trail."
82,2016-07-05,[''],"Nice trail, you have to go across the stream often, but it was fun. We didn't reach the end of the trail, but by the time we got back to our vehicle we had gone approx. 5.27 miles so the trail is longer than the posted 5.1 miles."
83,2016-06-25,['hiking'],Great
84,2016-06-25,['hiking'],My pup and I enjoyed this hike. There was not too much traffic on the trail... actually hardly any...and crossing back and forth over the river was pretty fun.
85,2016-06-15,['hiking'],Very fun trail. We kept going for about another thirty minutes past where the All Trails map had the ending point because there was a pretty clear trail that still kept going up - so we did about 7 miles round trip but it definitely could have been longer. You'll more than likely get your feet wet and it's quite overgrown about two miles in for most of the hike. We even spotted some sport climbing rocks on the way so that was neat. Overall a great trail! We didn't run into anyone.
86,2016-06-11,['hiking'],Really fun hike. Saw only a few others and a lot fewer further up. Got rained out so we had to come back early. Not sure how much further it was. The trail can also be over grown in some areas so you have to push your way through a little.
87,2016-06-10,['hiking'],Great hike with my pup! Really saw only three people. Loved the river and having to cross it so much. Wear some shoes that can get wet (I wore Chaco's).
88,2016-05-22,['hiking'],"Nice hike.  Muddy as the stream was in full flow with the spring rains.  It is a elevation climb from the beginning with numerous creek crossings.  Plan for shoes that can get wet.  We used walking sticks which was a great idea due to the mud. We went nearly 3 miles in and never hit the trail end. This is closer to a 6 or 6,5 round trip hike.  Enjoy."
89,2016-05-03,[''],This was a really nice hike. Only ran into a few hikers. I would not suggest taking little kids on this trail.
90,2016-04-08,['hiking'],"It was a great! Narrow trail, no traffic. I ran into only 2 other hikers. I won't recommend hiking with kids unless u r carrying them."
91,2016-02-27,[''],"Always beautiful, trail follows a flowing stream.  My dog and I love this trail."
92,2015-11-08,['hiking'],Great trail! Some parts were muddy and icy but nothing unbearable. Most of the leave were gone but it was still gorgeous.
93,2015-10-18,[''],Gorgeous trail- even at this time of year! The trail is covered by canopy except for a couple of spots. Took a dog and he had a blast! Definitely will be back to this trail.
94,2015-08-16,['hiking'],"Did this hike this morning.  I very much enjoyed this trail.  It was mostly covered, and followed a stream all the way.  We took our dogs and they loved it too.  I would like to do this again in the fall when the leaves change color.  The views and the scenery are just great.  3/4 of the way up the trail, it's a very wet area.  We saw lots of pretty mushrooms and moss growing everywhere.  I would recommend this for most people.  

One thing to note:  This trail is listed as 5 miles in and out.  We turned around after 3 miles up the trail, so 6 miles in and out for us and we could have kept going too."
95,2015-08-16,[''],"Great hike, we mad it through the overgrown foliage to the end of the trail. Nice creek at top. Almost ran on top of rattlesnake coiled in the path in the forest about 1.5 miles from TH and my partner would have been bit since he was behind me."
96,2015-01-31,['hiking'],Tried getting up the trail very icy. Not recommended if you don't have crampons. This is normally a great trail but is in a deep northern canyon with little sun exposure. Thought I would take the kids out for a little adventure and it was tough from the beginning. I will try it again in the spring or it will be a good summer trail since it is mostly in the shade. :\
97,2014-10-13,['hiking'],"A really pretty hike. We didn't make it all the way to the top of the canyon because of thunderstorms, but enjoyed the part that we were able to do. We brought our dog and she loved it. It's shaded for most of the way and runs along the stream for most of the way. Plus, we barely saw any other hikers along the way."
98,2014-10-05,['hiking'],"A lovely lengthy hike winding through the canyon from bottom to top accompanied by a rambling brook with plenty of deep pools and adjoining mountain springs. Plenty of woods, rocks and beautiful foliage for this Autumn's jaunt :)"
99,2014-07-24,['hiking'],"Great hike! Took the dogs, be careful with off-leash though, there are steep drops down to the stream. It was really great since there are spots for the dogs to get their feet wet and keep them cool, and lots of the trail is covered. We didn't go too far up, but definitely looking forward to seeing what's further next time. First hike in a VERY long time, not too hard at all!"
100,2013-12-02,['hiking'],"I did this hike yesterday. It was exactly as described. I made it up quite a way. I only saw a few other people on the trail, so that was nice. I was looking for this mythical tree farm, but had no luck. I really couldn't find any place that it could have been hiding. I did run into an area with a lot of tall evergreens that could have been from the seeds of said farm though. 
The stream had a lot of frozen areas that were interesting looking. I can only imagine that this will become more pronounced as it gets colder."
101,2013-09-24,['hiking'],"Really nice hike with varied terrain and a stream by you the entire time.  Foliage gets a little thick the farther you get.  Good shoes, preferably waterproof, are essential here as you have multiple creek crossings and it's easier if you don't have to keep them completely dry.  Very shaded.  I didn't get all the way as I got a late start but hope to try again soon."
102,2013-09-08,['hiking'],"Not going to write a long review.  This has been an easy access hike for us, never crowed, some geocaching, watch for rattle snakes"
103,2013-06-13,['hiking'],"Awesome evening hike. I didn't make it as far as I would have liked to due to the fact that I got a late start. 

My last name is Sessions so I was naturally drawn to this trail. I wanted to find the Tree Farm mentioned in a few other reviews but I couldn't. It sounds interesting so I'll definitely come back. 

There were a few parts could be classified as difficult, but for the most part it was a pretty mellow hike. There are some over grown sections and fallen trees. I would do it again when I have more time. All in all, this was a very awesome hike."
104,2012-09-10,['hiking'],"The Sessions Canyon trail is a great hiking trail because it is easy to get to, it has some interesting places to see, and because it is not real crowded.  There are a couple drawbacks to this trail however:

It doesn't have the spectacular views that one gets from trails that leave the canyon floor and heads up to the mountainsides.  There are several tacky little campsites that kids haul their beer up to drink at and leave messy.

But, once one gets a mile or so up the trail, the little camps fade away and some of the charm of the canyon begins to come out.  

There are a couple neat things about the trail that some may not be aware of.  After the fifth crossing you will come into one of those little tacky camping spots.  Head south up the North Face of Sessions Canyon and you will pick up a trail that ends up at what the locals call the ""Tree Farm"" which was in fact a planting of Christmas trees planted by a local company I think back in the 50's or 60's that was abandoned and never harvested.  What stand now is a somewhat haunting grove of 40 foot pines planted in neat rows over several acres.  

The old road that was used to access the tree farm heads down the back of the Sessions Mountain and goes into a subdivision right through the driveway of one of the homes built high above Bountiful.  Be respectful.

The old road that was used to access the Tree Farm also continues East past the Tree Farm and connects to a mining road that continues East up the ridge line of the Sessions Mountain, crosses the pipeline, and continues East until it connects with the Great Western Trail.  There is a cirque that is at the top of the ridge line that separates Sessions Canyon from Mill Stream Canyon that is a little hairy to cross but once you get East of the Cirque you are just a few hundred yards from the Great Western Trail.

If you walk far enough one eventually ends up at the Skyline Road at the top of the mountains overlooking Bountiful.  One can then loop down the pipeline trail that ends up at the same trail head parking lot that you started from ( a good workout for many an extreme runner I have seen passing me along the trail).  Or you can have someone drive up the Skyline Road and pick you up (LOL)."
105,2012-08-20,['hiking'],A very nice Sunday hike. We only saw a few other hikers the whole time. Nice shade on a hot day with a few nice clearings that are worth the obstructed views others here described. A few splits in the path that can be confusing but being able to hear the water makes it easy. Make sure you save a little for the final climb back to you car!
106,2012-08-01,['hiking'],"In nature, water flows downhill.

And so, this trail goes up, and up, and up!

I wanted to do this trail again as the first time I attempted to tackle this canyon it was too hot and late in the day.

Today, I was on the trail at 9 AM the morning after a rain. The air was clean and the aroma from the dirt, trees and fauna were very prevalent. I was making much better time heading up the canyon than I did several weeks ago. So far the trail wasn't too bad, but it continues to go up!

While hiking along the trail the soothing sounds of water rushing down the mountain accompany the hiker for miles. The creek becomes part of the hiking experience as the trail crosses it several times, some of the crossings are sturdy foot bridges while others are rocks or fallen trees. 

A good pair of sturdy yet comfortable hiking shoes are recommended. 

The trail rises and falls with the landscape of the mountains. 

For the most part the trail is shaded by large pine and aspen trees. Some parts are exposed to the full force of the sun but those spots are brief and mainly toward the beginning of the hike. 

If hiking doesn't sound like much fun take a horse. This trail is open to horseback riding, but closed to motorcycles and ATVs. Every so often there are flat spots where people have built small fire rings for an evening outing or an overnight camp out. I counted 11 such camping areas. Be sure to check with the local forest service before lighting a fire in the canyon, because during the hot summer months it could be illegal. 

This trail is moderate to strenuous in difficulty, probably not the best place to take young children especially since crossing the stream can be rather dangerous for youngsters. 

Also a tip to make hiking this trail a better experience take a friend along. One it's safer that way, and two it's always better to experience the beauty of the great outdoors with a friend. 

This is a fairly nice trail, although I will not do it again. The canyon is a bit confining, very few places where you can see the forest through all the trees. Also, I found this trail a bit more demanding on this old body than I would like. The constant grind of going uphill with no visible end in sight wasn't any fun! I finally turned around when the trail became overgrown and difficult to follow.

107,2012-07-25,['hiking'],"Sessions is a pretty creek canyon, which like many creek trails along the Wasatch Front, climbs through rocky terrain and gradually peters out the farther you go.  We went 2.5 miles, and found that the brush was getting too thick for our liking.  The shade is really nice, and the creek is lovely, while the rocky terrain gives a sense of adventure.  The fact that the trailhead is just feet from residential Bountiful makes it a great trail for access as well."
108,2012-06-04,['hiking'],"We got a very late start o this trail. Hit the trail head at 5:00PM and about 90 degrees!. Trail starts out going straight down for about 400 feet into the creek's catch basin. After the posted signs, it runs level with the creek for a bit, then we start going up and up. We walked for about an hour to the third bridge crossing and then turned back. This will be a trail for another day, preferably in the morning.

Four Stars for what I've seen so far!"
