0,2019-08-26,['hiking'],Awesome!
1,2019-08-18,['hiking'],definitely tough. it is a constant incline the majority of the way. bring water. 
2,2019-07-06,['hiking'],It was a very hard trial and steep going up and coming down. Coming down is a lot harder than going up!!
3,2019-06-10,[''],this is a climb. up hill both ways sort of hike. packed to stay at the cabin. was lovely and feel like Rambo now. cheers!
4,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","I hiked to the falls on Adams canyon trail then took a steep vertical scramble with much bushwhacking up to the Adams cabin trail. It's a tough unadvisable adventure, but it's doable. I felt victorious by pulling this stunt off but can't advise doing it. Pushing through trees and brush uphill added hours to the hike."
5,2019-05-09,['hiking'],Good place to hike to if you’re respectful. Hiked it today but lost my dog up there. She’s a female vizsla. She’s red and is wearing a blue collar. If you hike this and find her please lmk. Thanks

7,2019-04-06,['hiking'],"Went in April, and you will be blazing the trail yourself so make sure you have plenty of time to accomplish this hike. After the switchbacks you have the dreaded climb straight up. After this its a moderate elevation gain and really nice rock formations and views of the valley and surrounding mountains. April still had waist deep snow and looked as if i was the only one on the trail since no tracks were in front of me. Keep on track with your app and you'll make it. "
8,2019-01-28,"['hiking', 'snow']",it's so worth it once you get there. the trail wasn't even noticeable after 2 miles. so we followed this map. didn't need any spikes. and only need snowshoes at the last half mile. you won't need them anymore since it's packed down now.
9,2018-12-22,['hiking'],Fun cabin. Great views
10,2018-12-11,[''],"Hiked last summer...Fair warning they’re not kidding when they say this hike is hard. I’ve hiked plenty of ‘hard’ rated hikes before and this one kicked my butt. I would recommend hiking early in the morning or on a cooler day since most of the hike is in the sun. The beginning of the hike was really hard to find since it doesn’t look like a trail at all. It just looks like a dirt hill...you basically go up the switchbacks and then walk straight up this super steep dirt hill that eventually starts to form a trail. On the way up the hike there’s a little cave thats pretty cool by all the big rock formations so don’t miss that. The cabin is in good shape and was really cool, it made the difficult hike worth it...bring plenty of water, you’ll need more than you think trust me."
11,2018-09-29,['trail running'],"I came across the cabin and used the trail as part of my descent from Thurston Peak. I decided to make a detour and see the cabin while I was in the area.
My thoughts on the cabin? Meh. I would definitely not have made the trek up this trail just to see it, but that’s just me. I didn’t look inside of it, nor did I care to. As for the trail - I only descended it but man was it unenjoyable. Scrub oak impeded the trail the whole time, loose rocks, sandy, washed out in some areas. I wouldn’t even say the views would be worth the effort, but I didn’t look up from the trail for fear of tripping over roots or rocks. It’s uphill the entire way so if you want a workout, here it is.
The real problem is that not enough people use the trail to keep the oak cleared away. I wouldn’t recommend this route as you will get beat up by the terrain."
12,2018-09-06,['hiking'],"This trail was ridiculous! It doesn't even look like a trail, just washout. It goes straight up the mountain and the first part after the sandy switchbacks, is completely exposed. Just rubble and small shrubs, no shade at all. You will need either a hiking stick or ski poles to make this hike, especially for the way down. It's very steep and very easy to trip or slide. I didn't even make it a mile before I was done, not a hike so much as a couple hours on a stair master."
13,2018-08-20,['hiking'],"that was amazing,but it's just uphill"
14,2018-08-07,['hiking'],Made a trip up here before the snow really starts to fly.  This is a great hike and the cabin is in good shape.
15,2018-08-05,['hiking'],"You go straight up, the entire time, you have been warned. Beautiful and well worth the hike! The cabin is awesome and would be fun to use one day. You do need to be in good shape to do this hike. I say that because the last part of the trail is dangerous to traverse especially if you are low on energy! We used all 4 liters of water and would take a bit more the next time we go. My Wife killed it on this trail, but it was still difficult. This hike will make you feel good."
16,2018-07-28,[''],"As others have mentioned, the trail is overgrown, especially near the top. Coming down, the steep incline and loose trail conditions make it hard to find stable footing."
17,2018-07-14,[''],"nice trail but almost dead, because of mother nature is closing the trail..."
18,2018-06-23,[''],Did this trail yesterday. It was the second time I've done it. 1000' / mile. It took 2 hours up and 50 mins down. It's a hard climb but very worth it.
19,2018-05-22,['hiking'],"My son and I started out the hike around 6:00 pm  with the cabin as our goal. We really thought we could could do an out and back before it got dark. We only had the t-shirts and shorts we were wearing and a couple of granola bars for food.  We ended up getting to the cabin, but by that time it was getting dark and a storm was coming in. We were soaked with sweat, and we made the decision to just go ahead and stay in the cabin for the night instead of facing the dark and cold wind of the incoming storm.  Needless to say we made the best of the situation and gathered up some firewood, made us a nice fire to warm up with and to dry out our clothes.  We shared the granola bars for dinner and we explored our shelter for the night. We found a gas stove with propane to heat up water or cook some food. We also found a flash light which helped to light up the cabin, and a battery operated set of Christmas lights we turned on that really set the mood.  The sleeping bags were great, and my son picked the warmer flannel one.  He quickly found out that a family of spiders had made their home in it after crawling in to get warm.  It was great fun seeing him scramble out of the bag as the family of spiders started coming out to investigate the intruder.  He shook it out real well to get them all out. The wind blew all night, and a branch from a tree kept scraping on the metal roof which sounded like an animal scratching and trying to get in.  We finally got warm and our clothes were drying out by the fire, so we climbed into our bags and tried to get some sleep. It was a long sleepless night, but we got up at 5:30, got dressed, and started back down the trail as the sun began to come up. This will be a great memory I will reflect on in the coming years and just smile!"
20,2018-05-21,['hiking'],This trail is a beast! My Apple Watch tracked ~ 3.4 miles up from the parking lot at the bottom of the switchbacks (the trailhead for the Adams canyon trail as well). This difference threw my dad and I off in terms of timing and we spent a night in the cabin. The fireplace vents great and there are sleeping bags left for anyone to use. Lucky our destination was a cabin. The views are incredible. Highly recommend this hike for anyone with good experience.
21,2018-05-10,['hiking'],"Great trail. Almost need pants for upper parts as the branches are overgrown. Nice cabin. The water set up was the best. Somebody knows something about survival. Definitely a climb. Be prepared to climb, on the trail, 5+ steep mountain peaks."
22,2018-04-28,['trail running'],"Don't attempt this trail unless you are ready to climb a thousand feet for every mile you go. The first mile and a half are pretty exposed but after that you're into the trees.

Be extra cautious on the decent, the trail is mostly loose rocks and gravel.

The views of the valley are breathtaking and the forest scenery and stone cliff faces are stunning. Easily the best trail in Davis county."
23,2018-04-21,[''],Used Adam's Canyon Trail to get to Adam's Cabin Trail. Very difficult to get to Cabin Trail from Waterfall (Canyon) Trail. We enjoyed the challenge of it as we found ourselves in the middle of nowhere. Near the cabin the trail is covered by snow but we were able to use a previous hiker's footprints. Definitely will do it again but will use Adam's Cabin Trail. Missed the waterfall due to high water.
24,2018-04-21,['hiking'],"Good hike, love it."
25,2018-04-21,[''],"Hiked this on Thursday. Excellent hike as always, used to do it all the time in the summer. I suggest to take a friend, spikes or a ski pole still, after the bridge it's snowy and slick, especially coming down. Still a beautiful hike."
26,2018-04-15,[''],"hiked today, very hard hike. Bring hiking cleats for the last mile, lots of slush and mud. Cabin is still in good condition, bring a pen for the log book."
27,2018-04-08,[''],Very steep!!! Amazing trail with no one on it. I nearly got lost near the top because it was still all snow and there were no foot prints. Had to use spikes for the last half mile. My pup and I loved it. Such a workout! The cabin itself was super creepy but then again it was in the clouds and my dog and I were the only ones up there.
28,2018-02-11,['hiking'],wonderful winter trail! very steep in places and straight up. would defiantly recommend bringing water. cabin is hidden to the south at top of trail.
29,2018-01-18,[''],"This was a great hike! I loved it. it was extremely challenging, but very rewarding. The giant Rock formations that you get to hike over and through were very cool, and the cabin was very neat too! I made it up according to the alltrail recorder in 1:40, but I'm super tall and was running solo with my pup, I would count on several hours for most to make it up as this trail head starts at the Bonneville shoreline at the top of the switchbacks.. and it literally just goes STRAIGHT up the mountain. it's almost laughable how much altitude you cover in a mile. but I don't like hikes that aren't challenging. this was like 95% consistent steep uphill with a couple steps down every mile lol. If you are up for it I highly recommend it!"
30,2018-01-01,[''],deep snow made it very difficult for this 74 year old man.
31,2017-11-19,[''],Fun hike awesome views. Dislike the sandy trailhead at the beginning
32,2017-08-19,[''],very nice views
33,2017-07-04,['hiking'],"Nothing like a great hike to help you realize how woefully out of shape you are. The first .5 mile is not bad at all. Simple, sandy switchbacks. Then you come to the fork with the Bonneville Shoreline trail, Adams Canyon trail, and the Adams Cabin trail. The trail is obvious for the BST and the Canyon trail but I had to look for the Cabin trail. The AllTrails map helped a lot to find it. Turns out the washed out trail going straight up the hill was it.  And it was steep. No switchbacks, just straight up. Like Frodo climbing mt. Doom. It is pretty exposed. I left at 6:30 so the sun hadn't come over the mountains yet. You get in to some scrub oak sections which were pretty cool and covered. The last .5 mile is pretty bushwacky. Lots of overgrowth covering the trail but I never lost it. Scratched my legs up pretty good but whatever.  But again, mostly just straight up. The Cabin was kind of cool. The sun peeked over the top of the mountain right as I got to it so got some cool pictures. Jogged/Shuffled most of the way down. Pretty sketchy in some spots but not terrible. Out of the 40+ cars at the trail head, I did not see a single person on the Cabin trail. Everyone does the Canyon trail but I enjoy the alone time. I did the whole thing in 2:30:30. About an 1.5 hrs to the Cabin and an 1 hr down.  Strava clocked 5.9 miles and 3000ft elevation gain. I took 3 liters of water, drank one on the way up, downed one at the cabin and drank the last when I got to my car. The views are pretty incredible of the valley and the canyons on either side."
34,2017-06-28,[''],"Fun trail but definitely not the easiest to navigate your way through, at least when I did it. Lots of cool views! Definitely not a beginners hike."
35,2017-06-26,[''],Be very very careful there are A LOT of rattlesnakes on this trail right now. We seen 15+ snakes just recently. Awesome trail though if your looking for a good workout. lol
36,2017-06-04,[''],"I hiked this trail on June 3rd 2017
This is the steepest trail I have ever hiked and the most Beautiful. No one was on this trail .. it's very slippery going down the trail I fell several times . 
Cleated hiking shoes is a must or slip on your snow spikes for the trek back down .. stunning views .. lizards every where .. pretty flowers .. take tons of water .. great work out !! 
By far my favorite trail .
I'm 55 in good shape !! Not a beginners trail"
37,2017-04-17,['hiking'],Great hike.  It was not a casual hike.  We did have to traverse snow for about a 100 yards at the top.  The cabin was accessible even though it was still drifted.  Legs felt like rubber when we got back.  Can't wait to do it again.
38,2017-03-25,['hiking'],"Didn't make it to the cabin due to snow drifts at 7291'. There was a group that was coming down from spending the night at the cabin and they told us the trail for the last 0.5 mile was at least a foot of snow. At the rate, we were moving it was going to take us an hour without trekking poles and not everyone had winter boots. Our group watched the weather move in right as we were getting to the first large rock outcropping and visibility disappeared and we were in the clouds with a steady snowfall coming down on us. The hardest part of the whole trail is the fork off of the Adam's Canyon Trail that goes up the ridge. Once you get thru this section, it levels off to a reasonable gradient. Wished we could have seen the valley from where we were and will have to try again in the future."
39,2017-03-12,['hiking'],We got to the upper part of this trail by climbing up from Adams Falls hoping to see the cabin but didn't get high enough. Still the view of Great Salt Lake and the snow capped mountains to the west was amazing. Good easy to follow trail. The trail descends quite quickly so it must be quite a climb
40,2016-10-16,[''],Has anyone seen elk up there and can you hunt up that way
41,2016-10-07,['hiking'],"This trail was harder than anticipated, felt it in my legs for days following, but worth it! Beautiful views, cool little cabin and a great workout! Thick brush towards the top makes it easy to lose sight of who you're with and the trail! Good idea to keep tracking   Device the first time for this reason."
42,2016-08-30,['hiking'],"Woo Hoo!!  What an amazing workout!! I love reading the complaints about hard hikes.. You DID read its hard right? 

What a great hike though! Follow this map on this app to find the trailhead its not marked but this map took us straight to it. most of the trail is easy to follow last 1/4 mile is a little overgrown, so if you have sissy girly legs, wear pants. Once you get to the cabin beware of the bear and please clean up your garbage.  

Nope we didn't see anyone else the whole time, which was great and the way we prefer it! We did run out of water and it is almost in the sun the whole way.. we had about 75 oz water each and should have packed more.  If you leave earlier in the morning you should be fine, we got a later start around 11 at the end of august. 

Would do again, just not right away, Im very tired lol."
43,2016-08-30,['hiking'],Steep rough trek up the ridge. Mostly up on the way to the cabin. Takes me about 4 hours.
44,2016-08-17,['hiking'],Difficult!!! And overgrown. My legs got all scratched up and never saw another person on the trail. Hard to get correct trail. At the top of switchbacks go up the ominous huge hill that doesn't look like a trail. One of my least favorite hikes.
45,2016-08-14,[''],"Since no one else has said it yet, I will; this trail is BRUTAL. I don't much care for steeper trails, and this one averages out at over 1200 ft. per mile. 
But of course, I was curious to see the cabin and its surrounding scenery, so I ventured out on it anyway. While I will say it was worth the effort once reaching the top, I will not be attempting this trail again anytime soon. The descent back down alone was almost more difficult than the actual climb itself because it was so steep, and there is loose gravel virtually everywhere. Very difficult to get a solid footing. While I may not be the most avid hiker out there, I do enjoy a good challenge once in a while.... this one definitely put me to the test both physically, and mentally. If you're considering attempting this trail and it's your first time, make sure you give yourself PLENTY of time to complete it from start to finish (considering you're not planning to camp overnight at the top). It took me 6.5 hrs, 4 being the total amount to get to the top. Even on a cooler day, the sun will beat down on you and take quite a bit of your energy, so stop for shade and breaks as often as you need, and take PLENTY of water (I thought three 24oz. bottles and 2 protein bars was enough... I should have packed at least 1 more of each). Also, the cabin itself, although cool-looking, was actually pretty creepy once inside lol... I personally would not sleep in it. But there is a very nice opening about 50-60 yrds. up from it that's perfect for pitching a tent (you reach it right before descending to the cabin). The view of the mountains opposite from you are absolutely gorgeous! And so much easier to view from the camp spot because there are far less trees blocking the view. Overall, probably a much more enjoyable experience for the die-hard hiker. However, if you're like me, then it's probably only worth a once in a lifetime haul. That being said, you should definitely make sure you are well prepared for it either way. Have fun!"
46,2016-08-10,[''],Had a blast and enjoyed the burn.
47,2016-07-28,['hiking'],This hike is pretty unforgiving during hot summer days. Early mornings or late afternoons are the only times I would suggest venturing out on this trail. Make sure to bring lots and lots of water!
48,2016-07-19,[''],it was steep but wasn't that bad beautiful and the cabin looked cool
49,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"This trail is very hard, you are always going up, and the terrain gets steep in some areas so it becomes a little more difficult in some parts, the first 300 ft  ir so once you pass the Shoreline Trail and start the climb are a steep, and it's gets a little more harder on the summer and especially  on sunny, those  days are not advisable because your body will need a lot of water to stay hydrated, especially on the first third of the trail, where there are no trees for shade, the views are unbelievable, especially once you pass the first two rock formations on the trail, as you continue up you will start to find more shaded areas, and then you will get to a little forest, where you will find more shade."
50,2016-05-30,[''],easy trail!
51,2016-05-28,['hiking'],"The hike is 6 miles round trip and it is brutally steep, hot, and strenuous.  The redeeming qualities are the spring that you come about a quarter of a mile before the cabin and the beautiful valley where the cabin sits.  The cabin seems very cozy and like it would make a great place to spend the night. Pants would be advised over shorts as the top half of the trail rakes your legs.

W 111º  52.423"
52,2016-05-20,['hiking'],It was well worth it. Tough hike with the consistent vertical climb.
53,2016-05-20,['hiking'],"The trail starts out easy enough as it shares the same beginning as the Adams Canyon trail up to the point where it intersects the Shoreline trail. From there however, the trail gets much steeper as it ascends up the ridge line that flanks the north side of the canyon. We hiked it in mid May and there was still a little snow in the upper bowl as you traverse southward on the final leg to the cabin. The trail towards the top is also overgrown enough that you definitely want long pants and possibly long sleeves to protect you from the brush. The cabin is full of little treasures from past hikers including, thankfully, some adhesive bandages that my wife was able to use to cover some hot spots on her heels.  Bring plenty of water as you will be exposed to the sun approximately 90% of the hike. We will definitely hike it again and stay over night in the cabin next time. The descent can put your joints to the test. We wouldn't hike it without trekking poles. Cool views of the Wasatch Front most all of the way."
54,2016-03-21,[''],Loved it!
55,2015-11-09,['camping'],"Thousand feet of elevation gain per mile makes for a quad-buster of a backpack trip. It's NFP for sure. I've backpacked to it twice and day-tripped it multiple times. 
First BP was in spring (May I believe) and there was a good snow pack beneath the saddle just before reaching the cabin. The spring that is spoken of which is 1/4 mile on the trail before reaching the cabin was flowing nicely and I was able to replenish my water supply here. It had been raining prior to my arrival, so any timber was wet. Sadly no one had left any wood in the cabin to keep it dry. Starting a fire was very difficult. That morning I hiked east from the cabin down into the canyon to view where several roaring waterfalls converge. 
Second BP was in early November (yesterday). There was light traces of snow on the upper portions of the trail and trace snow pack around the cabin. The stream that crosses the trail before the cabin was dry, providing no water to replenish my supply. Water levels were low this year, so I can't say this will always be the case in November. 
The previous occupant had left wood in the cabin to use. In the morning I replenished (and more) what I had used. Dry wood in the cabin is a HUGE perk since it can be difficult getting a fire going if wood is wet. In the morning I hiked east of the cabin to the falls to replenish my water. The falls weren't nearly as large as in the spring, but there was enough water there to replenish my supply. 
That evening sleeping in the cabin a packrat (bushy-tailed woodrat) was climbing around the walls and table area. I let it do it's thing, they're pretty cute in my opinion. In the morning I repaired a large gap beneath the door where that little occupant nightly makes his entrance. 
The elevation gain over such a short distance makes this a real quad-buster, so it's not a trail for the unfit. 
If you stay in the cabin, pay it forward by leaving it cleaner than you found it, and leaving a pile of fallen wood for the next occupant."
56,2014-07-09,[''],"This is a wonderful hike.  You mostly stay on a ridge-line trail the entire way, so you always have a great view of the valley.  You gain a lot of elevation on this hike, so be prepared."
57,2013-11-17,['hiking'],You totally leaned into that bro!
58,2013-09-11,['hiking'],This is a fairly strenuous hike.  Be prepared for for it.  You will be walking straight up the north ridge of Adams Canyon.
59,2012-09-20,['hiking'],"This is a grate hike, you gain a lot of elevation so be in fairly good shape.  The scenery is unbeatable, It took us more like 4 hours one way with a baby.  There is a spring about 1/2 mile before you get to the cabin where I filtered water, i'm not shore if you need to filter the water or not."
