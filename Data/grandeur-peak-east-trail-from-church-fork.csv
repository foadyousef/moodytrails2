0,2019-09-08,['hiking'],Great trail we went up in the early afternoon and saw very few other hikers.  The sun was warm but mid 80s and it was not unbearable at all. On the way down we missed one switchback and ended up going down hill for a little way before we realized we missed the turn and we had to hike back up to the trail.  We also saw a lot of snakes and lizards including one rattlesnake that was right beside the trail and rattling furiously at us.
1,2019-09-07,['hiking'],"Amazing views, definitely recommend. Bring your pooch too."
2,2019-09-07,['trail running'],"Beautiful Misty Morning. Felt like Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins were going to greet me at any moment. No joke. Light rain made dirt perfect consistency for solid grip on way up. Couple puddles on way down. Also made for vibrant colors; reminded me of the movie ""What Dreams May Come"". Had trail to myself (715-9am).

Best Workout in town. Skip the road, treadmill, squats, lunges, gym, bootcamp etc...and hit this trail for a burner workout (if you push yourself).  The way up for glutes and quads. The way down for speed/agility/control, and developing the ability for making split second decisions on where to land the next precious step!!"
3,2019-09-05,['hiking'],Had a great hike today. I did overestimate my fitness level for this hike.  I’ve done it many times over the years but it’s crazy how fast you can lose stamina. Spoke with some nice search and rescue guys who were searching for a missing person.  Got passed twice by a guy doing ‘laps’ training for Spartan World Championships. Dog also had a great time.  I’ll do it again and work on my fitness.  
4,2019-09-01,['hiking'],"Trail was a little over 7 miles for me. Wasn't that busy on a Sunday morning, and the peak view is great. Most of the trail is pretty exposed, so mind the temperature when you depart. The end gets to be pretty tough uphill, but it's worth it!"
5,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"Easy hike, from Pipeline or Church fork. Lots of water on the first half of the trail. Bring a water filter in case you run out on the way down. Only took me 90 minutes to get up at a slow pace. Nice combination of shade and sun on the trail. I did encounter rattle snakes on the trail so just be mindful of where you step."
6,2019-08-19,"['hiking', 'rocky']","This is a great hike, it’s steep in some parts but the views are great the morning is better because it’s less hot and less bugs and snakes

7,2019-08-19,"['hiking', 'over grown']","We power-hiked/trail ran up from Elbow Fork Pipeline Trailhead to Grandeur Peak approximately 10 miles round-trip. We left mid-morning, it was a very hot day! We were doing some heat training, but we were very surprised how little shade and how overgrown the trail was for August. We did see one huge rattlesnake on the trail! Make sure you watch your step! 
We just barely had enough water and nutrition to do the full workout. You should definitely bring at least 1.5. liters of water and snacks! It is a steep climb, you should be at least an intermediate or advance hiker to hike up to Grandeur peak. Beginner hikers or bringing kids is not recommended. Also avoid going during mid-day, I recommend going in the early morning (6am) to enjoy cooler temperatures. The view of the Salt Lake Valley from the peak is beautiful! It is a difficult hike but worth it if you are properly prepared. Have fun and bring a friend.

8,2019-08-14,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Great trail hike this morning. Started early with no other hikers on the trail. Beautiful look-outs and spectacular peak view! 
9,2019-08-14,['hiking'],"It's a very fun hike with your dog. There's tons of waterfalls to take in and a stream runs along the trail for your dog to play in for about half the hike. It begins to get rocky and hot halfway through and then the amazing views begin to come a bit later. The crest was the coolest part more than the peak itself, I thought. I did come across some big snakes (non-poisonous) that alarmed me and I had to hold my dog back just in case."
10,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown', 'scramble']","The other reviews are correct in terms of steady climb, but the view is amazing! Glad we went early due to heat and bugs. "
11,2019-08-11,['hiking'],Very green right now. Pretty views!
12,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"Perfect day to do Grandeur Peak today.  Beautiful, a nice breeze.   It's lush,  green and slightly overgrown.  There are results snakes so be cautious. "
13,2019-08-09,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'over grown', 'rocky']","This hike was great. Unfortunately for me a huge storm rolled in so I couldn’t see anything from the top and I got completely soaked coming down, but it was still great. I spent no time at the top because of the rain, so it took me 2.5 hours round trip. (I parked in the lot right by the trailhead and the distance from there was only 5.82 round trip.) I’m in fairly decent shape and even I would consider it a hard hike. It’s pretty constant up hill, but some of the views I did see were amazing. I’ll have to do this again on a nicer day. The only caution I have for this trail and rain is that if it comes down hard enough the trail becomes a river and it’s very slippery, so be careful!"
14,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"Great hike with some tail running. Went later in the day so not as hot. Saw more lizards than I could count!

"
15,2019-07-30,['trail running'],"Awesome trail for running, getting in some vertical and getting that heart pumping! Consistent uphill, but nothing crazy unmanageable. But it’s a workout for sure. The views are spectacular and worth the climb, I promise! This trail is well maintained, but technical toward the top with rocks and roots. Nicely shaded throughout with some full exposure sections. I started around 4:00pm and was back to my car by 6:45 with some time resting at the top. Saw one (huge!) snake but no rattlers. Bring plenty of water and maybe some bug spray, they were definitely out. But it wasn’t too bad. Really enjoy this trail and it will always be a go to! Not too many parking spots at trailhead so you may need to park down the road a bit. Enjoy!"
16,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"We hit the trailhead early morning about 7:45, had minimal stops, hung out at the top, and was back down by noon! If you’re bringing dogs along I would recommend getting up as early as possible, as only about 1/4 of the trail is heavily wooded/shaded with water access. Overall feeling pretty accomplished, clocking out at 8.3 miles total "
17,2019-07-27,['hiking'],lovely trail. first mile has shade then it's exposed. steep near the top.
18,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Great morning hike. 1:21 to the top
19,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"You have to work for the end summit, especially over the last mile,  but a fun experience. Start from Rattlesnake Gultch for a real long one."
20,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble']","We just did this trail on Sunday July 21st. We went up with three kids ages 5, 6 and 7 and had three adults. It was difficult to find the trail head since its up through a gate and past some picnic areas, no one had cell reception and there were no signs that we saw. Luckily a woman we asked knew where it was. It was crazy hot. I recommend dipping yourself in the creek on the way up if you're starting late. We started at 11 a.m. and with three kids it took us 5 hours to get to the top including breaks and lunch. All of the wild flowers are in bloom so there are lots of bugs. Flies, bees, wasps, butterflies etc... We weren't too concerned. We had bug spray but they all left us alone except for the occasional landing. It took us 2 1/2 hours to get down, including breaks and some play time at the creek. Our 5 year old had difficulty slipping and fell a lot on the way down. She didn't have great tread on her shoes which we'll rectify before our next hike. But the trail down is easiest to take at a run. Overall a great hike, we'd definitely do it again. Hopefully when it's a bit cooler. "
21,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown', 'rocky']",I did this on 07/20/19. The trail conditions were perfect. I would strongly recommend a bug spray. Awesome views from the top. Will definitely do this again. 
22,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"The trail head is at the top of the paved road.  There are only a few parking spots at the trail head, otherwise you have to park on the main Millcreek road.  (The gate to the trail head doesn’t open until 8am.) I’ve done this hike a few times and really enjoy it. It’s a challenge.   Mix of uphill, switchbacks and more uphill.  Some of the trail is overgrown with the brush etc. but other than that, it’s a great trail.  We did see some snakes - not rattle snakes.    The trail has some shade and some sun.  I’d recommend going early (before 7am) to beat the heat or late evening to be in shade. The bugs at the summit are a bit of an annoyance, so bring bug spray. Overall- great hike.   Will do this again.  Took us ~4 hrs start to finish (including ur break at the top)  "
23,2019-07-13,['hiking'],Did this last night and surprisingly only saw one other person on the trail. We had the peak all to ourselves. Started at about 6:30 pm and had shade the entire hike. Roundtrip took us about 2 hours and 20 min including our rest at the top. Beautiful views the entire way! The hike has a steady incline the entire way up but is manageable.  
24,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"Sunday 7/719. I expected a lot more hikers but it wasn't crowded at all. This was my first time on this trail. It took about an hour & 15 minutes to reach the peak and another 40 minutes to reach the bottom. 
I only saw one snake but don't think it was a rattler. 
This was a fun trail and I plan to do it again next year."
25,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"So beautiful and great weather. Incredible views the entire hike. Did it with my 9 and 11 year old. It was hard but we did it in our tennis shoes and did great! Took us 3 hr 45 min. (Including the rest at the top.) Started at 6:15pm. Shaded the entire way. Perfect time of the day to go if you don’t mind hiking with a flashlight for an hour or so at the end. The dark did slow us down, so go an hour earlier to get down faster. Didn’t see or hear any snakes. "
26,2019-07-07,['hiking'],Great hike. 3.5 hours. Incredible views.
27,2019-07-05,['hiking'],its a hard rocky hike but still it can be a good time. no snow nice river
28,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"Great hike, beautiful views at the top. not a lot of shade towards the top so nice to start earlier. Saw a rattle snake towards the top and heard of a few others down the trail a ways. Stay safe ! "
29,2019-07-04,['hiking'],"Climbed this on July 4th.  Tough hike, consistent elevation gain the whole way.  My three kids (11, 8, & 8) made it, but the younger ones had a bit if a rough time for the last half mile to the top.  Beautiful views the whole way, and wonderful at the summit.  "
30,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"Great hike. Bring extra water as the top parts of the trail do not offer any shade. My dog laid under every pine tree he saw on the way down to get a little shade break. Great spot to bring snacks/lunch to eat at the peak. 
Saw 4 snakes on the trail on June 29th.  "
31,2019-07-03,['hiking'],The most enjoyable trail to the top of Grandeur (the west face is a suffer fest unless you go early or late in the day). Trail gets real busy on Saturdays and Monday nights during the summer. The lower section up to the pipeline is a lot more travelled than the sections past the pipeline.
32,2019-07-02,['hiking'],"Stunning views over the city. Very clear path, no bugs when we went.  Approx 2.5h at pretty fast speed."
33,2019-07-02,['trail running'],"Fun trail, great views, good hiking/trail running with my pooch."
34,2019-07-01,['hiking'],Very green and pretty along the hike. Easier than Mt Olympus. Can be done pretty quickly.
35,2019-06-27,['hiking'],Great trail with some slightly difficult scrambles at the top. will definitely be doing this one again. 
36,2019-06-26,['hiking'],Great trail.  Took 2.5 hours round trip.  Some snakes and lizards and lots of sun!
37,2019-06-25,"['hiking', 'bugs']","bugs at summit, but nowhere else"
38,2019-06-24,['hiking'],"Great views! 
"
39,2019-06-22,['hiking'],made it to the top. Awesome view.
40,2019-06-22,['hiking'],"This trail is awesome! Easily marked, well taken care of. We were able to hike it in just over an hour stopping and taking lots of pictures and then run down in about 45 minutes, amazing views and the flowers are just starting to bloom! "
41,2019-06-19,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Hiked this morning (started at 6:45 am) and it was absolutely gorgeous. The views are worth the climb, but definitely bring bug spray for the end. Because we left early, we had shade most of the hike. Be sure to bring plenty of water!"
42,2019-06-16,['hiking'],Snow is gone from the peak. We left early to avoid the hot. At the peak it was perfect weather. Bring bug spray and you’ll enjoy this beautiful mountain even more! 
43,2019-06-16,['hiking'],Beautiful views.  First third is shaded and last two thirds are in the sun so bring plenty of water. Flys and bugs were awful at the top so bring bug spray. 
44,2019-06-12,['hiking'],Love this hike. Beautiful views. Take lots of water and snacks. You will want Suncreen. Trail running back down topped it off as one of my favorites. 
45,2019-06-11,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Follows along a stream during the first part of the trial with lots of shade. Second half of the trek has virtually no shade. Great views of the canyons as well as SLC and the great salt lake. Would do again!
46,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Awesome hike with spectacular views!! First third of the hike is shaded and parallel to an awesome stream with waterfalls. Last two thirds is pretty steep switchbacks and a hefty incline. The views at the top though are WORTH IT. Full views of the valley and mountains all around. Make sure to bring plenty of water and bug spray though! Took us about 6 hours, but we stayed at the top for quite awhile enjoying all the beauty!"
47,2019-06-10,['hiking'],"Nice switchbacks all the way up, shaded for the first third.  Trail was mostly dry and in good condition. "
48,2019-06-10,['hiking'],"Great trail, beautiful views!"
49,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'scramble']","This trail is my happy place. I love it. It’s hard. My legs were done at the end. But I loved it. There is some scrambling and you need to wear good shoes. The view at the top is so worth it. You can see all of the Salt Lake valley all the way to the salt flats. Also, I met a guy at the top who runs it in 49 minutes. Maniac! Jk. That’s so impressive. It takes me hours because I sometimes meander and stop to breathe. "
50,2019-06-08,['hiking'],"This trail is great, especially if you have dog. The way up was tough but it was the way down that really kills the legs. Watch out for those trail runners because some of them mean business on that narrow trail. Views are amazing at the top. "
51,2019-06-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Trail was difficult, but beautiful and worth it. Only complaint is on the way down we almost went down the wrong path down a hill going who knows where. That would have been dangerous. "
52,2019-06-05,[''],"What a trail! Loved that it was marked and very easy to follow, trail was dry and not muddy. It was a CHALLENGE as it was uphill all the way to start with very little flat places. Exhausting... The first third of the trail was along a beautiful creek with a waterfall right at the start. The next third was open and had some great views of the mountains. The last third was more challenging with rocks that needs climbed, but very manageable. At time I thought about turning around, but very glad I went to the end. The final view is amazing and offers great views of SLC and surrounding area. Going down was hard on the knees. Straight downhill. Not sure I'd have the energy to do it again, but was glad that I did it and highly recommend doing this trail."
53,2019-06-04,['hiking'],"Gorgeous day for a birthday and a hike! Sun was shining, river was rushing, birds chirping, lots of lizards and insects. The last half mike of this trail kicks your booty but it’s so worth it. I somehow paused my recording at the top but I made it up and down in just under 3 hours. Carry lots of water and snacks on this hike. "
54,2019-06-04,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","Quite the workout! The trail wasn’t too muddy but there were parts that were slippery due to the streams running through it. I saw three snakes but they were all in the brush and not interested in the hikers. There are a few parts towards the last half mile or so that you’ll have to climb over some rocks but it is doable if you take your time. If you drive up into the canyon, make sure to bring $3 cash for the fee on the way out. "
55,2019-06-03,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Great hike, amazing views. June 3rd there was still some snow off the trail. Seemed like every hiker had their dogs with them, which I love. This hike has some of the best views of Salt Lake City. There’s not much shade, but nothing some sunscreen didn’t fix. "
56,2019-06-02,['hiking'],Trail is free of snow and tacky. There’s pretty wild Flowers. Great time to do this hike!
57,2019-06-02,['hiking'],"Hiked/trail ran June 2nd, started around 6am. Tacky dirt, beautiful wildflowers, hardly any mud, only a tiny patch of snow off to the side, and no bugs at the top! Absolutely beautiful time of year to mark this peak off of your list. "
58,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'no shade']",
59,2019-06-02,[''],the end of this trail is fantastic.  it was lightly raining and the fog over the mountains made it look pretend. A butt kicker for sure but 100% worth it. 
60,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'no shade']","pretty good hike.  very muddy and crowded.   I like dogs, but not when the owners don't clean up after the dogs.   took 1.5 hrs to summit "
61,2019-06-02,['hiking'],"The trailhead is normally ridiculously crowded on the weekend. So we waited to start until about 4pm and it was nice because most folks were leaving.  Storm on the way back really helped a lot too.  Started at the road 3.4 miles each way.  It's a good sustained climb when you start at Church fork.  Pretty views from the city, to East Canyon road, lambs pass and over to the South. Overall nice day."
62,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy']",It is a good hike. Gains a lot of elevation for how short it is. My girlfriend and I did the hike with full frame packs. The summit was beautiful! 
63,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
64,2019-06-01,['hiking'],trail completely clear
65,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Fantastic trail, well maintained, no snow, gorgeous views all the way. Took about 3.5 hours round trip at moderate pace with some stops for snacks and pictures"
66,2019-06-01,[''],Worth it
67,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Awesome trail, great views"
68,2019-05-31,['hiking'],"I tackled this hike on May 30, 2019. The trail is in great condition and all the snow is gone on the trail however towards the top I did pass one or two patches of snow. Grabbed a handful and put it on the back of my neck and it felt great. This was challenging for me mainly due to my lack of acclimation to higher elevation hiking. As I was nearing the summit I was really starting to feel the effects. it was rather warm during my hike and there is a section of the hike where you are in direct sun. Sunscreen is a must. As you approach the summit you do enter an area with some trees that provide some shade. It was a great spot to have lunch before I made the final push. I was really beginning to feel inadequate as there were people jogging past me going up and down. Ha ha. The views from the summit are absolutely spectacular. Views of the entire Salt Lake Valley. You can see the city, great Salt Lake, and more. Distant peaks have lots of snow still. It makes for incredible viewing."
69,2019-05-31,['hiking'],"view is worth it, trail is clear."
70,2019-05-31,['hiking'],Fri 5/31/19 8.30am-12.15pm. 50s-60s. Beautiful first class hike. First 1.2 miles is tough but thru beautiful forest and rushing stream. Next mile a bit easier but becomes exposed 100% to sun by end. Last mile was tough for me prob due to elevation. Fabulous views from top well worth the effort. No snow on trail now but snow capped peaks all around. Excellent.
71,2019-05-30,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'no shade']","Wonderful hike! My friend and I did it in about 3.5 hours or less. Not much shade near the top, bring sunscreen if you’re going in the summer. It’s a great sunrise hike, saw lots of dogs on the trail. Just a bit of snow near the top, which made the path muddy in a few spots."
72,2019-05-26,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'washed out']",
73,2019-05-20,['hiking'],"Loved this hike! Slushy, muddy, snowy wonderful trail! "
74,2019-05-17,['hiking'],Great hike with great views. 
75,2019-05-15,['hiking'],beautiful hike! Much prettier than the west side. No real snow to speak of. this is a trail that I will definitely do more often.
76,2019-05-12,['hiking'],Beautiful views! There are still a few slippery patches of snow/slush the last half mile or so.
77,2019-05-11,['hiking'],"I always start the “season” with Grandeur, as it’s clear(er) of snow before most of Big or Little. There were still sections of snow at the top, and as it got warmer, it was like hiking through room-temperature butter. Nano spikes helped a bit, poles would help a lot, but mostly people were just falling on their butts, all good. I like to get an early start for this one as it gets busy, but it’s also gorgeous around sundown."
78,2019-05-11,['hiking'],"Trail is in great shape.  No mud, little snow near the top. Cleats not needed, but would have been nice for the walk down.   Great time of year to get out and play."

83,2019-04-27,['hiking'],Amazing mod-hard trail. First 2.5 miles are a moderate beautiful climb. Last bit to the peak still has good amount of snow and a working climb. Worth it!!! Soo beautiful. Weather is perfect!!!
84,2019-04-25,['hiking'],"There is a ton of snow, so prepare for that. Views at the top are beautiful! It is steep pretty much the entire way."
85,2019-04-20,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Bring crampons and poles if you plan on going to the summit. There’s still a lot of snow and ice along the trail.
86,2019-04-20,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'no shade', 'snow']","Pretty nice hike here, elevation gain is pretty stable for the first 2 miles of the hike.  I'd say about 600' per mile with the last 1.5 being the most elevation gain with a pretty deep snow pack at the moment around 5-6' probably.  It was pretty easy to hike in though, I did not need crampons or poles, but carry if that makes you more comfortable.  the trail is exposed for probably more than half so sun screen.  I'd bring something to slide down on for the decent.  The grade is nice enough for a good sled down.  It took me about 1.5 hrs to reach the top and 30-45mins on the decent(Jogging). I'd assume you can do this under 2 hrs in the best conditions."
87,2019-04-06,[''],"hiked Grandeur Peak trail 4/6/19.  Significant snow, ice, mud, watered out trail. Kahtoola MicroSpikes an absolute must item for the steep icy parts of the trail. Very few hikers on the trail today, saw a couple trail runners and 1 other group of hikers."
88,2019-04-01,"['hiking', 'snow']",
89,2019-03-31,['hiking'],"The trail was packed down for the most part. A bit slushy in some parts. I had some micro spikes and that was sufficient for this hike today. Amazing views and well worth the effort to get to the top.

Agree with the recommendation to take a hat. Also recommend sunglasses. Sun off the snow is bright."
90,2019-03-17,['hiking'],"Very nice views, it gets steep in some parts especially near the top."
91,2019-03-17,[''],"Just got done with this hike and I am super pumped that I made it up to the top.   Took me a while but I made it!!!  Coming down with Yaktrax Diamond Grips on I was sliding on some parts.  Hit the ground a few times and one time I hit pretty hard... Tylenol here I come!!!!  I will say that the trail was slushy in some parts due to the sun...take a hat if it's gonna be sunny.   Also if you are into hiking when it's warmer out then you will be happy to know at least for today I saw signs of Spring.   Saw a smaller river with some pretty good flow and also a waterfall too.  That's the first I have seen that in quite a few months.   This is supposed to be  one of the easiest peaks to get to, but it put a whooping on me.  I really think this was perfect to challenge me without really killing me....I got a sore back and probably some legs that aren't liking me but it's all good."
92,2019-03-09,"['hiking', 'snow']","A fantastic trail . 
Now it’s March  , so the trail is cover with snow . 
It’s easy to walk on the trail , bring hiking sticks, 
The view is wonderful."
93,2019-03-09,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'snow']","The snow was beautiful, definitely a super hard hike when there is snow but worth it for the view at the top! I paused the hike a few times and forgot to resume it again, so the hike was closer to 7 miles."
94,2019-02-26,['hiking'],"Hiked this on Saturday and it was beautiful. Spikes were a must due to the snow. The trail is well packed down, but the final push is brutal. Straight up. Some switch backs would have been nice. But still worth it."
95,2019-02-01,[''],This took me 3.5 hours and I’m and out of town / somewhat out of shape person. Spikes were all I used but I wouldn’t have minded having some poles. Relatively steady incline until the end it gets a little steep but doable. Incredible views.
96,2019-01-14,['hiking'],"Just finished this hike. If your looking for a way out of the inversion soup, this is a great little hike to get above it. The trail is hard pack snow, making it a really nice, smooth hike. It’s actually a more comfortable hike than in summer in my opinion. With micro spikes and poles you’ll have zero problems on this trail.  Beautiful, sunny warm skies up there above the smog.  It’s well worth it!!"
97,2019-01-07,['hiking'],Great hike! Bring those spikes!
98,2019-01-06,['hiking'],"Just got down.  Only spikes used, some areas I wish I had poles but overall doable without, at this time.  Thanks to the postholers, everything is mostly compact.  Great hike."
99,2019-01-01,[''],Beautiful hike this morning. Only used spikes. Did some post holing about the last half mile.
100,2018-12-30,['hiking'],"Great hike, great views.  I would say its even better to do this hike in the winter on a nice day...just really beautiful from top to bottom with the snow.  Microspikes are the way to go.   If you're not running up or down the trail I would say you could knock this out 2/1/2 - 3 hrs of actual hiking time if you're in moderate shape.  If you do run down it takes about 35-45 mins with some stretches of walking."
101,2018-12-22,['hiking'],"Trail is packed snow most of the time, wet dirt in many spots. Spikes are very helpful, especially at the steep parts near the top. Snowshoes would be overkill. It was a nice clear day which made for incredible views!"
102,2018-12-11,[''],"Hiked it this am. Had to park on the road since we started early (5:30am) and the gate was closed. It was cool in the predawn, but it warmed a bit as we left the creek and then again as the sun rose as we approached the summit at 6:30. Including a break at the summit to enjoy the view it was still under 2 hours round trip. A little steep in spots, but nothing technical or challenging.   Under 90 minutes would've been possible if we'd run down.

Definitely recommend the hike. Had been 20+ years since I hiked it last but the rattle of the Aspen leaves and the smell of brush and wild flowers was very nostalgic. The view in every direction was fantastic."
103,2018-12-07,['snowshoeing'],A nice trail with great views but waaay too busy. The trail is packed all the way so I really did not need the snowshoes.
104,2018-11-21,[''],Beautiful hike. Steep at the beginning and the end but the midsection is mild. Views at the end were great. Trail is icy in spots so make sure you have proper footwear and/or poles. Trail was a little busier than I would have liked but worth it regardless. There is a $3 fee to access the canyon and dogs have to be leashed on even days.
105,2018-11-15,['hiking'],Such a beautiful hike! The leaves were just turning colors and there was a lot of shade.
106,2018-10-29,['hiking'],"Perfect low elevation hike while the weather permits. No snow on the trail nor at the top, which is why it was perfect for this time of year."
107,2018-10-13,['hiking'],"Great mid-range hike. Passing through Church Falls is beautiful, and the views of Millcreek Canyon from the top are amazing. Legs got a little tired towards the top, though."
108,2018-10-13,[''],"Consistent climbing up, amazing views along the trail!!"
109,2018-10-07,[''],1 hr up. 30 down push hard for a great leg day. great fall views
110,2018-10-01,['hiking'],"I've hiked the east face trail of Grandeur several times and I love it.  For me, it's the perfect combination of length + elevation gain that gives me a great workout but I'm not exhausted when it's over.

The parking is not great, however.  There's only room for about 8 cars at the trailhead, then you have to park out on the main road which adds about a half mile to your hike."
111,2018-09-26,['hiking'],"Well maintained trail but no great views until the top.  Pretty steep incline throughout most the hike, so you will definitely feel your legs burn.  Overall a pretty fun hike!"
112,2018-09-26,['hiking'],"Hiked w/ my 9 yr old son, 2 hrs up, 1 hr down. Well-maintained, heavily travelled trail, smooth and steady climb. Good for serious trail runners (very few rocks/roots). Dog-friendly. Not much of a view until you get to the top. No cell reception until top ridge. You CAN PARK up past the picnic areas but there are ONLY 7 spots at the trailhead. They were all taken on this hot sunny weekday afternoon, but it saves you 0.4 miles."
113,2018-09-25,[''],"Gorgeous fall colors all along the way and spectacular view at the summit.  I would classify this as a hard, not moderate.  I consider myself in shape but this mountain kicked my butt!  Temps were just perfect.  It took us 3 hours 40 minutes.  Watch the tree roots on the way down, I took a nasty spill."
114,2018-09-15,[''],Awesome hike to a 360 degree view!
115,2018-09-04,['hiking'],"I am a beginner hiker in okay shape and this was a toughie! For me this was on the harder side of moderate. It basically inclines steadily for 2 miles, then gradually for a mile, then sharply for .4 miles. First mile-ish is in the shade, then it's pretty much no shade until the top! Sunscreen is a must and I regret starting this trail at 10:30am. It took me 2.5 hours to get to the top, and much of this trail ended up being in over 80 degree weather and lots of sun. Bring plenty of water. A neat 360 degree view at the top. I won't do this again until I'm in better shape!"
116,2018-09-02,['hiking'],"Grandeur Peak has spectacular 360 degree views. One side you have the Salt Lake Valley and the other you have nearly untouched wilderness of the Wasatch Mountains. There are some points up the trail that are a bit steep and rough on the knees, but nothing technical at all or anything too hard. The payoff in the end is absolutely worth it. 
A lot of dogs on the trail. Nearly as many as humans. We did see a sign that stated dogs were allowed on odd-numbered days only, so if you aren't one to want to share the trail with pups, then try an even-numbered day. Also, few children on this hike unless they were being carried by their parents. I think a child 8 and over could do this hike."
117,2018-08-22,['hiking'],"Beautiful views of the canyon and the valley!
Went with the intention of  watching the sunset but we got chased out by a lightening storm!

There are a lot of things to trip on. There is some scrambling involved in a few spots. I'm 5' 5""  and me and my two dogs handled it... pretty well. 

Caution : There are plenty of little water spots for dogs to try and drink from. One of my dogs got very sick  about 6 hours later... And it lasted all the next day. I don't know if it was from the water or something on the ground.. Just be aware of your pooch!

I would love to try this again, when it isn't storming.

118,2018-08-13,['trail running'],"Did this hike with my wife on Saturday morning around 930am. Should’ve left earlier because it got blistering hot on the way down. Also, asthma suffers beware! With the wildfire smoke so dense I’ve never felt my self literally gasping for air towards the top. I recommend if you are sensitive to this bad air right now, stay away. Other than that, lots of little lizards looking for bugs on the trail. Lots of bugs at the top. Can’t wait till the smoke clears so we can hike this one again and enjoy the views!"
119,2018-08-13,['hiking'],"My family would tell you I am obsessed with this hike.  Beautiful trail, flowers in early summer.  Just enough alternation of elevation and then some levelling out to feel like a good bit of interval cardio.  It does get more difficult towards the end, but oh so worth it.  I tended to hike in the afternoon, so the temperatures were lovely, and shade was about 50/50.  It took me 2 hours from the freeway to reach the peak.  Views at the peak are gorgeous.  Half of the view you can gaze over Salt Lake, the other half you can look over Emmigration and Wasatch canyons while feeling that you're miles from the city."
120,2018-08-10,['hiking'],"Heard the rattle near the top! Hike had pretty even elevation gains and was nicely shaded below, lots of exposure second half. Amazing 360 degree views from the top but the wildfire smoke was a lil damper. Started at 7am on a Friday and only saw a handful of people."
121,2018-08-08,['hiking'],"My first summit! Did this one back in 2012, but it was what would become the first of many loved climbs. :-) 

Great views. Brought my Huskies with me."
122,2018-08-07,['hiking'],"This is a shot in the dark... my cell phone fell out of my backpack today . If someone stumbles upon an iphone 7 with a gold glitter case, a message will appear who to call once charged.  Likely place it fell: towards the top of the map, there's a spot on the trail that takes a sharp right then turns left again making a Z. Instead of taking that sharp right I veered to the left into a sandy/rocky area for a bit before realizing I was off trail. We think it fell somewhere in there. As for my review... moderately strenuous hike with incredible views! (disappointed to have had to turn around early today!)"
123,2018-08-05,[''],I just did this one this morning. The views at the top are amazing!
124,2018-08-01,['hiking'],"Loved it! The hike was certainly moderately inclined throughout. I don’t think any parts were steeper than any others. The trail was nice, soft dirt, but not loose dirt. Not a lot of rocks. The views as you climb get better and better. The peak is magnificent. 360 degree high-level views as far as your eye can see. The trail is mostly shaded in the beginning and much less so as you get nearer to the peak. No nearby water for refills, so bring plenty. We did this hike around noon Sunday and there were very few people on the trail. Highly recommend!"
125,2018-07-23,['hiking'],"Great warm-up peak if you're planning some of the taller mountains in the area. Fairly steep early on, but becomes easier for a stretch until the final push to the top. Snow melts early too, so it's a great early season hike."
126,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"This hike had some pretty incredible views! The only thing that bothered me was how much exposure you get to the sun in some areas.. so I would suggest hiking this pretty early to avoid the heat. We didn’t see any wildlife.. but the views made up for that. We also managed to lose the trail in one area where there’s a sharp turn, but there’s also another trail going straight at the same point.. if you end up scrambling up sliding red rocks, you’re going the wrong way haha"
127,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"This is my new favorite! Lots of tree cover on the bottom half, sweet earthy smells along the creek, absolutely stunning views. Did this as a solo hike, and there were just enough other people on the trail that it felt safe, but not crowded. Ample parking @ 7:30am. As others have indicated, do be aware of rattlesnakes, I saw two within feet of the trail. Also got to see a few lizards, and two unidentifiable large birds with unusual flight patterns, perched atop the tallest tree at the peak. I can’t wait to do this one again!"
128,2018-07-14,['hiking'],"Great hike, especially the views. Lower half has more shade, upper half has better views. Didn't see a lot of wild flowers. There were plenty of hikers with dogs. Lots of lizards. Saw a spotted towhee and a female dusky grouse. Saw one rattlesnake at the very top. Lots of little lizards. Any spot where water crossed the trail was swarming with wasps/hornets on the way up, but we just walked through and they didn't bother us. They were gone by 8pm on our way back. Definitely park at the trailhead vice the the highway. Just enter the Church Fork Picnic Area and keep going by all the picnic spots until you can't go any further."
129,2018-07-05,[''],Beautiful hike!
130,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"I'd give this 3 1/2 stars, but given no half stars it drops to a 3 for reasons to follow.

The hike is a good workout, and I extended it a bit by starting at Rattlesnake Gulch, then connecting over with a short 2-mile stretch of Pipeline. That alone gets it 2 stars.

The flowers were really nice when I did it on Friday, June 22nd, and that gives it another star, as does hiking next to water for a fair bit.

The drawbacks were that the views from the top are good, but not great. They're expansive, but not Alpine. Additionally, once on the upper ridge and on top then noise from some industrial operation down in the valley broke up the potential for serene appreciation.

I'd do this again, but there are so many hikes in the greater SLC area I wouldn't be rushing back..."
131,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"Very pretty trail, but better done in the morning. The flies would not leave me alone and I was spooked by 3 rattlesnakes and a couple of smaller, probably harmless snakes."
132,2018-06-30,['hiking'],"Completed this hike on 6/16 late afternoon/evening. This was a difficult hike for the being rated moderate. The hike is more like 4 miles each way if you start from the road, which is what the signs say to do. Wide trail for the first mile or so, but gets quite narrow after that. Lots of beautiful wild flowers this weekend, which got better as you get closer to the peak. Tons of bugs the whole way. Lots of shade at the beginning of the hike, but less as you get farther up. We saw a snake a little ways from the peak. Not sure what kind it was, but it didn't look like a rattlesnake. Gorgeous panoramic view at the top, with views of the city and the surrounding mountains."
133,2018-06-27,[''],"Moderate? Really? As I lay in bed with my broken body haha! It was very beautiful, and one hell of a hike. It being my first peak, it was quiet the work out and I really had to push myself. Lots of cute lizards and shade here and there. The views are amazing and the wild flowers were beautiful."
134,2018-06-26,[''],Took 2 hours up and 1.5 back down and I stopped maybe 10 times to take a 1 minute break. Cool view of the city but even better views of the mountains to the east. Beautiful wildflowers this time of year. One of my favs in Utah. Hiked this on a Monday morning and started at 7 am. Hardly anyone on the trail!
135,2018-06-20,['hiking'],A great early season hike.  I wouldn't want to do this hike on a hot day in full sun as it's fairly exposed.  One of the easiest peak hikes you can do in the Wasatch!
136,2018-06-19,[''],"Super petty, not too hard or crowded! But it has 0’shade!"
137,2018-06-18,['hiking'],"Loved this trail! Some of the most beautiful views of the mountains and valley. Started at 8 am, got to the peak about 9:30. Got down in about an hour. Great workout but not as hard as other peaks. Definitely one of my favorite hikes now. Everything was super green & lots of beautiful wildflowers."
138,2018-06-15,['hiking'],"Took my pup up last night, did not disappoint. However, this is the most strenuous “moderate” trail I’ve ever seen haha. 
Gets hardest the last half mile, so be prepared for that. Didn’t see any snakes. Returned to my vehicle close to 1am and felt safe the entire time. Love this trail!"
139,2018-06-13,['hiking'],"On Sunday, June 10th, the wildflowers were in peak form.  Lupine, penstemon, vetch, and wild roses surround the trail.  No snakes or other wildlife except lizards, which used to be abundant in the Salt Lake Valley, but seem to be non-existent there now.  A beautiful view of the valley from the summit is a great reward for a hearty hike."
140,2018-06-13,['hiking'],super pretty!!! fairly steep and not many flat areas to hike i would say this is a little closer to hard an moderate but 10/10 would recommend. but watch for snakes we saw 4 today...
141,2018-06-11,['hiking'],Great hike! It was the perfect length and difficulty. You have to walk through the parking lot for several minutes before arriving at the trailhead. Saw no snakes and the bugs weren't too bad either.
142,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"I did this super early in the morning, so no rattlesnakes, no bugs and not that many people. The downside of starting early is that the Church Fork gate is closed until 8 AM, so you have to walk .2 miles up through the picnic area to the trailhead, which may be the steepest part of the hike. Most of the people with dogs are considerate, but sadly, not all of them."
143,2018-06-10,[''],"Such a beautiful and fun hike! Great during the day, and as a sunset hike!"
144,2018-06-04,['hiking'],Very fun trail with good views. Very very crowded though with some narrow parts that passing with dogs becomes an issue when the trail is crowded
145,2018-06-04,['hiking'],Great hike with beautiful views! Please be aware the flies come out in abundance once it starts to warm up and literally stick to you from mile 1 and beyond. We had two different types of bug sprays with us and neither worked. Rattle snakes were also up and making their way across the trail in multiple locations. Recommend this as a early morning hike.
146,2018-06-04,['hiking'],Beautiful! Flies are out once it starts to warm up. Still worth it. :)
147,2018-06-03,[''],Great trail. Awesome views of the canyon on the way up and great view of the canyon and salt lake at the top. It’s a good challenge but definitely doable for people who aren’t in peak cardio shape. Still one of my favorites even though I sprained my ankle on the way down 
148,2018-06-03,[''],Great hike with dogs! All owners/ hikers were respectful and friendly. Well shaded and well marked. The view at the top is awesome! Really enjoyed this hike last weekend!
149,2018-06-03,['hiking'],Quite a workout but well worth it.
150,2018-05-31,['hiking'],Beautiful but make sure to bring bug spray. Even bug spray won’t help with the flys though and they bite. Views of SLC and parleys canyon as well as mill creek made the hike well worth it.
151,2018-05-30,['trail running'],Mostly dry trail. We started at 715 p and got to the top about sunset. Recommend flashlights and headlamps if starting after 6pm. Beautiful views.
152,2018-05-28,['hiking'],One of the most beautiful hikes the Wasatch Front has to offer. I stopped many times just to take in the view. I can’t wait to do it again with the fall colors. Moderate skill level.
153,2018-05-26,[''],"Great workout, beautiful views. Make sure to wear plenty of sunscreen and bug spray!"
154,2018-05-25,[''],"Very nice trail. Fairly steep, but beautiful and peaceful."
155,2018-05-23,[''],"This is quite a work out but well worth the effort.  The views from the top are amazing.  The entire valley is visible,  so are the surrounding mountains."
156,2018-05-23,['hiking'],"Amazing views of downtown, Mt Olympus, parleys, and the whole valley. Start at church fork picnic area, shaded switchbacks for a while, then opens up for a bit then more switchbacks, then an open traverse up to the top. The last 1/2 mile to a mile is pretty steep. 400 ft/mile did it in 3.5 hours. 2 hrs to top."
157,2018-05-22,['hiking'],"stopped just short of the summit due to a storm that rolled in. in hindsight it didn't last long but better to be safe then sorry. beautiful views and fantastic wildflowers that got better and more abundent the higher you hike!!! 
 trail definitely starts off pretty steep but becomes more manageable the higher you get."
158,2018-05-20,['hiking'],Gorgeous hike! The majority is in the trees covered by shade. Bring water and snacks it’ll take about four hours. We saw lots of families with kids and 50+ yr old people hiking this with us. There are lots of places to stop and rest or turn back . There are steep areas that tire you out but also flat switch backs that make it enjoyable. Gorgeous views the whole way not just at the end! Moderate is a perfect rating !
159,2018-05-19,['hiking'],"This trail starts out hard, following the creek bed straight up.  Gets a bit easier once the switch-backs start and you begin to climb out of the creek bed.  The views south across Mill Creek Canyon are fantastic, and plenty of yellow and blue wildflowers along the way (I wish I knew what to call them).  Great lookout across Salt Lake City from the summit.  Not nearly so crowded as Mt Olympus (only about a dozen other hikers on a Friday AM), and not quite as much of a crushing climb.  Snow is all gone now.  Would love to spend more time here."
160,2018-05-18,['trail running'],Just hiked/ran this 5/15/18. It was in awesome conditions. I hit the trail at 6:30pm hit the top at 7:40pm. Everybody I ran into on the trail was so nice. it is a pretty steady incline. I was a little surprised how little running I could do. Although I'm not in the best shape. there were quite a few people getting their runs in.
161,2018-05-17,['hiking'],One of my all time favorites. Difficulty is fair but absolutely worth the effort. The scenery along the way up to the peak is beautiful and the view from the peak is breathtaking. You could watch the sunrise and the sunset from up there. Amazing hike. Bring plenty of water and some trail snacks.
162,2018-05-06,['hiking'],"We hiked this one last week when high was in the mid-60s and the sun was shining.  The trail starts steep, shady, and cool in the pines and spruces heading north along the creek.  There are several small stream crossings and don't miss the large rock face on your left that you can climb up from the north side for a great vantage point. 

Roughly half way up you will start exiting the tall trees into the scrubby stuff (bring sunscreen) and the switchbacks will begin.  The trail gets rougher and narrower here and you will encounter some minor scrambling opportunities as you continue upward.  There are a few spots to sit and enjoy a view of Parley's canyon if you need a snack break getting close to the peak.

The peak provides ample room to hang out for a while and soak in the view of the valley and nearby peaks.  We brought a pair of binoculars for fun.  

This is a great trail for those wanting to advance their hiking capability from the beginner level.  This one really boosted my wife's confidence.  The moderate rating, in my opinion, is accurate."
163,2018-04-29,[''],Very nice beginner hike. Not technical
164,2018-04-27,['hiking'],Steep! A climb the whole time but so worth it! Not much snow left at the top and I was easily able to get to the summit with just some quality hiking boots. Don’t get lost on your way back down!
165,2018-04-26,['hiking'],"Absolutely GORGEOUS today. I had 6.4 miles from the Church Fork Campground. It took us about two hours to reach the summit at a pretty average pace. Only a few snowy spots left on the trail, I didn’t have spikes and made it just fine!"
166,2018-04-24,['hiking'],"I love how the terrain on this trail varies...from evergreen forest along the roaring creek, to dry and rocky, to snow at the top!  I was alone hiking, so definitely didn't attempt the snow without spikes.  The distance measurement definitely doesn't take into account the walk from the gate to the trailhead since the picnic grounds are still closed.  This trail is very manageable for most ability levels.  There are lots of places to stop and take a break.  The views are amazing."
167,2018-04-21,['hiking'],"Very slushy at the top - spikes recommended. Also, round trip is about 6.5 miles, not 5.8."
168,2018-04-21,['hiking'],"I love this trail in spring, as it’s clear earlier than most. The east side is in full sun most of the way, so be prepared. Just before the summit (at the steepest part) it’s still snowy/slushy/slippery and spikes helped a ton, especially on the way down. FYI, I always clock this closer to 6.5 RT (from the gate at the bottom of the Church Fork campground.)."
169,2018-04-20,['walking'],II am pretty athletic and found this trail to be exciting and beautiful but also steep and grueling. I was exhausted by the time we reached the summit. I would rate this trail as difficult not moderate.. I’m from Ohio so maybe I’m not used to such steep climbs or the altitude - so if your not a local it may be a difficult trail.
170,2018-04-15,['hiking'],Challenging hike. Beautiful view at the top worth the work.
171,2018-04-09,['backpacking'],"Beautiful hike today! Trail is pretty muddy, and last mile or so was very icy, so I would extremely recommend spikes! Ran into a pretty aggressive bull moose on the way back down, they’re definitely active later in the day so be careful!"
172,2018-04-07,[''],"Really enjoyed this trail. Ran/hiked it in about 2.5 hours last Sunday. Trail near the top still covered in snow and ice. Did not have treads, but I did have trekking poles which helped immensely. Woman on the trail didn't control her dog who ended up biting my hand as I tried to walk past...keep your dogs under control please!"
173,2018-04-04,['hiking'],"Definitely a fun hike and less crowded than the Pipeline trail further down the canyon. The trail was relatively easy to follow, though it's still slushy and icy the higher up you go. You might want to consider microspikes if you want to make it to the peak this time of year, but you can get pretty high up without them. Really stunning views."
174,2018-03-31,['hiking'],Fantastic hike today! The weather was perfect. Needed microspikes near the top to get up - the funnest part was sledding on my bum on the way down! Great views!
175,2018-03-25,[''],"Loved this trail! Not too challenging most of the way...though the top was steep and covered in snow. Glad I brought microspikes but I’m a bit of an ice wuss. Saw a moose near the picnic area. I was criticized for keeping my dog on a leash, which seemed odd to me..."
176,2018-03-23,[''],Love this hike no matter what the season!! Quick and challenging- and gorgeous views!!!
177,2018-03-21,['hiking'],An excellent trail but was unable to finish because of bad weather coming in and it getting too dark.
178,2018-03-07,[''],"Hiked it 3/6/18. In total it took about 4 hours to complete.  It was challenging, but not overwhelming.  

Really would like to try it in the summer."
179,2018-02-25,[''],"This. So wonderful. Some good work to get to the top, and you’ll be pleasantly rewarded. Took about 3 hours to summit and 1 hour to descend. I’d love to night hike this in the summer."
180,2018-02-17,['hiking'],"Such a great morning to be on Grandeur. This was my first time up the backside and it was nice and gradual compared to the steep climbs on the valley face. Lots of friendly people on the trail and the dog owners were very respectful (much appreciated). I used spikes for the last 1/4 mile, more just to use them as I lugged them up there, and are not necessary but helpful. Arrived at the summit 10 min before sunrise for some great pics of the sun peaking it's head out. Great views"
181,2018-02-17,[''],"Went up early afternoon, south facing slopes are slushy and got my socks wet but no big deal, spikes would be useful on the last 100 yards of the summit but not necessary. Otherwise fun hike w/ great views"
182,2018-02-12,['hiking'],Nice hike. I was surprised by a large  group of Ultra Marathon runners running for the RUFA 2018 run. Very nice group of extreme runners. Trail was icy and snowy up top and spikes were definitely needed. Took me 1:40 to reach Peak
183,2018-02-11,['hiking'],"Good hike 2/10/18. Little bit of snow, cloudy, lots of trail runners. Microspikes handy. Saw  numerous people slipping and falling on their ass."
184,2018-02-10,['hiking'],"Great hike yesterday. Spikes would be nice at the top, but not needed. Crazy hiking in Feb with it 60 degrees."
185,2018-02-08,['hiking'],"Did this hike 4 days ago and the ice was minimal, although there were a few sections where spikes were a godsend (esp on the way down).  Gorgeous views, as always, but this was my first time doing any kind of winter summit so I was extra stoked.  Beautiful views at the top!!"
186,2018-01-28,[''],A couple inches of snow covered the ice and we only used microspikes on the way down for a little extra traction. Amazing hike.
187,2018-01-17,['hiking'],Awesome hike. Definitely a workout. A lot of ice. Micro spikes work well. Some mud
188,2018-01-15,[''],Really icy this time of year. Have some spikes on hand. It ended up being about 7.5 miles round trip. Saw a moose off the trailhead. Beautiful views
189,2018-01-02,['hiking'],"A bit muddy, but more snowy and icy.   Totally worth it.  Wear MicroSpikes for an enjoyable climb and descent."
190,2018-01-01,[''],wear your spikes as its icy for most of the trail.
191,2017-12-14,[''],amazing winter hike
192,2017-12-11,[''],Really loved this hike! Definitely wished I had cleats for the snow and ice but it was great

194,2017-12-10,['backpacking'],"Very good route. Had modest snow and ice. Have read that this is EASY, and read that this is MODERATE. Based on current conditions, I would rate difficult. I base this on climbing Camelback mountain in Phoenix a week or so ago and that was rated double diamond ""extremely difficult"".  You cannot snowshoe this.  I was glad I didn't grab any and instead opted for my spikes. Saw many people wishing they had brought spikes. 

I'm not a runner, was carrying medium pack (training for bigger climbs) and using sticks. Start was very cold and Packed snow. About half way it shifts to lots of ice and slush. Then on the westbound leg plenty of mud mixes in with ice. The final half miles gets a little steeper and there are a few 3-4' little scrambles that are a little precarious coming back down. The summit is great. Wonderful views and a couple places (rocks) to sit and cook a lunch. The estimate of 2.5hrs was spot on for me. Round trip from road (gate closed) was right at 5 miles with 2500' gained. Lots of people on the route today, but not overly crowded. Current weather is a little odd where higher elevations are warmer than the lower ones."
195,2017-12-06,['hiking'],"Always a great hike, even with 8”-12” of new snow. In winter months you’ll add 0.3 of a mile hiking up from the main road since the gate is locked until spring. Had the peak all to myself with amazing coral-like snow covered trees. Remember to hydrate in winter even though it’s cold and the sun goes down really early. Most of the hike will be shaded after 4:00 p.m."
196,2017-12-03,['hiking'],"Fun hike, a little slippery with snow/slush near the summit."
197,2017-11-26,['hiking'],"Beginning of the hike had coverage, but the last half of the hike didn't have any and it got really hot. I would go early enough that you are able to get to the top before it gets too warm (took us two hours up). Beautiful waterfalls and scenery along the trail and amazing views at the top."
198,2017-11-09,['hiking'],Great peak to be able to bag if you don’t have much time.
199,2017-11-06,['hiking'],"The views while hiking were beautiful! I didn’t get to see the view from the peak because it was snowing and covered in clouds. Which was fun in and of itself, but I would like to see the view one day. I will be doing this hike again next Spring/Summer!

I am an avid hiker and the hike up took me 1 hour 20 minutes. The trail was marked and easy to follow. You may want to pay attention to the trail at the very top, once you start climbing rocks, I think that’s the only place you may get confused on the way back down."
200,2017-11-05,['hiking'],Great hike w/ 3 dogs.
201,2017-11-04,['hiking'],This was constantly steep.  We ran out of time and didn't make it to the top but got to the second overlook and we're satisfied with what we accomplished.  Next time we'll plan better.  Great workout!
202,2017-10-30,[''],
203,2017-10-28,['hiking'],"Wow. This trail was like an emotional rollercoaster. We went from paved trail and waterfalls to hiking on dirt with beautiful fall leaves around us to super rocky terrain with epic views. We were about a quarter of a mile from the peak and saw a nice overlook to stop and rest with our 18-mo old (in carrier). It had 360 degree views and made us feel like we were at the peak and decided to go ahead and call it because we were beat. We will definitely do this hike again, but maybe without the kid."
204,2017-10-20,['hiking'],
205,2017-10-18,['hiking'],"Did this hike with my 6yr old, who is an avid hiker. Loved it! It was a great workout!"
206,2017-10-13,['hiking'],This was a great ~7 mi hike. Fall foliage was gorgeous and the view of SLC is awesome. Took us about 3.5 hours.
207,2017-10-06,[''],Loved this hike!!  Nice uphill and great workout.  The views along the way are outstanding also!!  Right now the leaves are stunning... get out there and try it in the next three weeks!!  It's only going to get better!!  And watch out for rattlesnakes..... there was a big one on the trail yesterday- he was super mad about something and rattled his tail at me for a while before he slid back into the scrub oak.  Just be careful and enjoy it!!
208,2017-10-04,[''],A bit windy and misty- trail in good shape.  About 8 folks and their dogs up this morning.
209,2017-09-30,[''],Great views of the city
210,2017-09-24,['hiking'],Trail isn’t well marked in places. I had to consult the map a couple times to find the way back down in places. Other than the fog at the top(clouds) and the snow and rain it was a lovely trip. Well traveled and lots of friendly people.
211,2017-09-23,[''],Beautiful trail!  Lots of clouds up at the peak this morning.  A few parts near the peak were a little slick due to packed snow along the trail.  Lots of friendly faces and dogs on the trail this morning.  The trail markers were a bit confusing.  I had to confirm that we were on the right trail a few times with some other hikers.
212,2017-09-08,[''],Plan at least four hours!  I've done this hike twice and both times I underestimated the length of time it takes.  Beautiful hike!
213,2017-08-18,['hiking'],Fun hike steeper incline on the way up than estimated so had to go a little slower.  But mostly shaded so that's a plus!  Worth the effort for sure.
214,2017-07-19,[''],"Loved this trail. 
First third or so of the hike is in tree cover and follows a stream, which was nice to cool off in on the way down, and the last two thirds offered great views of the surrounding mountains. I'd even go so far to say the views during he hike were better than the peak."
215,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"I did this hike 7/16/2017 with my 10 year old son. At the trailhead it was 99 degrees. It was hot but we've completed other higher peaks, and harder hikes in hotter weather.

There was 3 spots on the trail with a trickle of water. At those 3 spots we had to run through swarms of wasps. There was snakes under the overgrowth on the trail. There was a lot of lizards, I like lizards but not when I am watching for snakes. After the first overlook of the valley we encountered 3 rattlesnakes (slithering their nastiness off the trail we were about to walk on). I wasn't going to risk us getting bit at the top of a stupid mountain so I took a picture of the peak, about a hundred yards away and called it good. My son and I ran back down. Not because we trail run, because we are scared of snakes. 

Physically, this is an easy hike. If you aren't a big baby about snakes and you want an easy hike to a peak this is your hike. Personally I will stick to higher more physically exhausting adventures to avoid the mental breakdown this hike gave me."
216,2017-07-10,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail with lots of wildflowers. Most of the trail is a basic dirt pathway, but there are a few areas where the trail gets a bit rocky and requires some scrambling. Overall I'd say that most people in average condition should be able to handle this trail.

It can get a little hot toward the top where there is limited cover, but the bottom 1/2 of the trail has decent coverage. Definitely a morning or evening hike - don't try this in the middle of the day."
217,2017-07-10,['hiking'],This trail may not be for beginners. I suggest going early in the morning before it gets to hot. It was defiantly one of the more beautiful trails to go on.
218,2017-07-03,['hiking'],The wildflowers are brilliant right now! Lovely hike.
219,2017-07-01,[''],This trail kicked my butt!
220,2017-06-24,['hiking'],
221,2017-06-18,[''],"Beautiful trail, beautiful views, and dog friendly!"
222,2017-06-18,[''],"This trail was awesome but it was no easy feat for a beginner. I'm not an avid hiker and it kicked my butt but it was still very doable. It took us 3 hours to get up and 2 hours to get back. It was really steep almost the whole way which made coming back down more difficult.  Someone there were super human people who ran up this thing but that would have killed any of us in our group. Plan ahead, take tons of water and food, take it slow. The view at the top was well worth every ounce of it!"
223,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"It was a great trail.   A casual walk up took us 2 hours 40 minutes.  2 hours 10 minutes back. We went on a Saturday at 7:30. Plenty of people to see, runners a plenty and dogs on the trail. The views were spectacular. So glad I did it!"
224,2017-06-16,[''],"This trail sucks on a hot day. Luckily wasn't too bad today. Still had to keep our dogs wet to keep them from over heating. Saw a rattlesnake on the trail, with our hiking poles my partner kinda pushed it off the trail and we continued. It's a bit on the harder side, slowly but surely we made it. Not very many places to take a break, just on the trail, but worth it!!"
225,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"Fun hike! The trail jumps off above the Church Fork picnic area, there are only about 8 parking spots up at the top so we parked off the canyon road and just walked up there. The first mile of the trail is nicely shaded,  the next 2 miles are pretty exposed so bring plenty of water. The trail wasn't super easy but it's definitely significantly easier than other trails marked Hard on alltrails (like Olympus and Gobbler's Knob)."
226,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"If it's a hot day, this hike is great for the afternoon/evening. You'll get a good bit of shade coverage."
227,2017-06-07,[''],Beautiful View and very Challenging.
228,2017-06-06,['hiking'],"I think I am the first to write a review like this one. At least I have not seen one. 

We have never done this hike before, like many of you. So, I just put 'Grandeur Peak' in the maps app on my phone. It took us to the first trail head - Rattlesnake Gulch. Unfortunately it is about a 3.5 mile hike to the actual trail head of Grandeur Peak - Church Fork. This is unfortunate because we were ill prepared for another 4.2 mile hike up to the tip top of Grandeur Peak. Ran out of water (3 Liters total) at about the beginning of the Church Fork Trail head. But we thought, hey the sign says 3.1 miles from here so we can do it. Unfortunately I measured it with my GPS and it is actually 4.2 miles to the very top. So, by the time we got to the top, we had already traveled 7.7 miles. Add another 4.2 back to Church Fork and then another 3 to get to where we parked, we went a total of about 15 miles. 

Long story short, make sure if you start from Rattlesnake Gulch, do so with enough liquids! and plan on a 15 mile hike

Amazing view at the top! Worth it, I think! haha

Hopefully this helps someone!
Peace and Love my fellow land travelers!"
229,2017-06-04,[''],great hike. lots of rattle snakes towards the peak. many sold flowers and the view was awesome.
230,2017-06-04,['trail running'],"Just run up in 1h, down in 35min
Very nice trail for the sunset, the temperature was good as it was a little bit cloudy.
The view is wonderful at the very top of the peak!"
231,2017-06-03,[''],"Great hike!  My favorite so far near Salt Lake (just moved).  Shade and water for the first 1/3rd of the way up the trail, then spotty shade for a bit, and pretty open that last mile to mile and a half.  Most of the trail seems moderate, but the last 3/4 mile is a bit steeper with a few short scrambles.  The view of the Canyon is amazing for about half the trail, and the wild flowers were pretty.  The Peak was a nice open 360 view with a lot of natural seating to enjoy."
232,2017-06-02,['hiking'],"Great evening hike. Wonderful view. I would rate the trail as moderate. It was well maintained. No snow. There are some shade areas but also direct sun depending on the time of day.  Parking can be tricky as it fills up quickly. Great view of the valley, especially at sunset."
233,2017-05-31,['hiking'],great views and nature til the rocky barren mountain top.. Totally worth it.
234,2017-05-31,[''],"Great hike, incredible view. I did this at sunset and it was awesome. Parking is tricky, may be lucky and get a spot in the small lot up passed the picnic area. It's rated as ""hard"", but I think moderate is more accurate."
235,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"Hiked sunday over Memorial day weekend, no snow, heavily trafficked, gorgeous clear view at the top. One of my favorite views."
236,2017-05-26,['hiking'],"One of my go to trails, it's close to the city, has a great view and does not have any mountain bikes. It's pretty steep, but it's worth it once you're at the top"
237,2017-05-17,['hiking'],I did this hike over the weekend and there was no snow left on the trail. It was very difficult but very rewarding! Tons of mountain views throughout the whole hike. I moved to SLC this March and this has been my favorite hike so far in the Wasatch mountains. :)
238,2017-05-16,[''],"I've just got back into hiking after many year (and pounds) ago. This hike kicked my trash! It was fantastic, great views water along the way for my dog to play in, but if you are out of shape like me, it's a hard hike pretty sure I'll be walking stiff tomorrow"
239,2017-05-15,['hiking'],"This is our favorite hike so far in the 9 months since we moved here. Difficult enough without feeling like dying (I'm talking to you,  Mt. Olympus) and gorgeous scenery most of the way. Fantastic 360° view at top can't be beat!"
240,2017-05-14,['hiking'],Loved it. Cloud deck was low so I was just above the clouds at the peak. Was clear for 10 minutes then the clouds blew in and had a tiny bit of sleet. Amazing experience. Met a lot of happy hikers on the trail!
241,2017-05-13,['hiking'],Beautiful trail and the views are unbelievable! I just relocated here from Colorado and it feels like home already!
242,2017-05-12,[''],"Great trail. No more snow on the trail. If this is your first trail, be prepared to feel your quads after you come down. Great views along the way!"
243,2017-05-08,['hiking'],"Hiked and run from different trail heads. It is a nice hike, not too easy. Good for spring and fall. Can be exposed in the summer. The view on top is pretty good. Can be crowded on weekends, especially it if is an odd day. That is when dogs are off leash."
244,2017-05-06,['hiking'],We started out at 8 am and we're done at 11. This is an amazing hike Peaceful and beautiful. A great way to start the season.
245,2017-05-06,['hiking'],Love this trail. I started around 9:30 am and there were about 20 other people total going up and down. The trail was totally clear except for a couple of snow patches at the top which I was able to walk through in my goretex low-profile hiking sneakers. The view is beautiful along the trail. It's very well maintained with long switchbacks. It was more crowded on the way down with people coming up. There are only two spots where you have to kinda climb over rocks but it's easy. My knee hurt a bit coming down but the switchbacks were long enough to make it bearable. I highly recommend this trail for people who are in pretty good shape. I didn't have cell service from the base of the mountain until I got on top. But up top I had perfect service and was able to check in and send some Snaps!
246,2017-05-06,['hiking'],
247,2017-05-06,['hiking'],"Great trail. A little bit of snow lingering at the top. Trail is muddy in some areas due to snow melt but overall really beautiful, some flowers are starting to bloom."
248,2017-05-03,['hiking'],"Great hike. Really beautiful views of the valley. Just went on Sunday, May 1, and there is still snow on the top of the trail. I would recommend micro spikes or poles. I loved it."
249,2017-04-30,['hiking'],"Such an amazing hike! Be prepared for mud, slush and snow! You'll forget all about that once you reach the peak! Absolutely worth every second of the hike!"
250,2017-04-24,['hiking'],"well marked, lots of different things to see:  forest; waterfalls; open brush, vistas and a peak where you can see all of Salt Lake City but turn around and see nothing but mountains.  just a little bit of snow left and plenty of room at the top for lots of groups to sit and enjoy the views."
251,2017-04-24,[''],It's longer than 5.5 miles. I recorded 7.5 miles. It's beautiful though!
252,2017-04-22,['hiking'],Hike was great! There's still some snowy and muddy areas but it's not bad. The view up top is fantastic but there's not really places to sit down.
253,2017-04-22,[''],My first hike of the season!  It was tough but the views are awesome. Trail had some muddy spots and some snowy spots.
254,2017-04-22,[''],Great hike! Great view! Beginning has the sounds of the creek and then the higher you get the more spectacular the view!
255,2017-04-17,['hiking'],"So from the main road, where you have to park as the gate to the picnic area is still closed, the app we were using to track us said it was 4.5 to the top, so 9 total. I have done grandeur a few times, but even from the road, so I suppose this could be accurate. There was some snow still left at the top, a few places that were extra slick, so micospikes would still be nice to have in your bag to pull out at the end. We did NOT have to go straight up at the top, the ""wrap around"" was snow free and accessible. Hardly any mud, it really just went from dry to snow, in a matter of feet. Rain/snow is in the forecast for the next few days, so this is all likely to change. I'd love to know someone else's RT mileage from the road as well!"
256,2017-04-11,[''],Hiked it 4/10 was snow all the way but it was melting fast on my way down.
257,2017-04-01,['hiking'],Loved it! As of 4/1 the trail is pretty muddy with snow the last .25 mile. I'd still consider spikes a necessity for a safe up and down to the peak.
258,2017-03-26,[''],Love this hike!
259,2017-03-24,['hiking'],"Great hike--good workout and amazing views.  Did this hike on 3/19/17.  As of that time it was still pretty snowy near the top which made for some pretty slow going, and wet feet coming back down.  Totally worth it though.

Kristan Makl:  I think someone may have found the micro spikes you lost.  There was a single blue set of micro spikes (the kind with the metal spirals on the bottom) that someone had placed on top of a post at the trailhead.  It was there as of Sunday 3/19/17."
260,2017-03-19,[''],Great hike. Super steep towards the summit especially in snow but for sure a leg burner
261,2017-03-17,['hiking'],Great hike and stunning view! The last half mile has about three feet of snow on it. If you plan to go past the saddle micro spikes are a must. lost one of mine on the way down somewhere between the peak and the saddle if anyone happens to find it.
262,2017-03-06,['hiking'],"Amazing Hike.  Went from Church Fork to the summit, then down the West face.  South side was nice and snowy, micro-spikes recommended, snow shoes would have been an overkill.  West face was slippy, windy and eventually muddy."
263,2017-03-05,[''],Nice variety and amazing view
264,2017-02-17,['trail running'],"part on an event where we got real familiar with the trail on multiple laps in the snow.  just short enough to enjoy, long enough to be a workout"
265,2017-02-13,[''],Great hike this time of year. Mellow up until the last half mile up to the saddle and peak. Doable with no cleats/spikes but the top part (and coming down) is much easier with some cleats/spikes and trekking poles. Avalanche danger: Green.
266,2017-02-12,['hiking'],"Great winter hike, definitely glad I wore spikes. The last ascent is a beast but we'll worth the views. I went on a non-dog day and still saw dogs, which is cool but please pick up your shit."
267,2017-01-30,[''],"Beautiful, sunny day. Trail is packed solid, and it's great to get above the smog and see the blue sky. only downside are the plentiful bags of dog poop along the trail. if dog owners want to keep dog access open, they better figure it out. Put that shit in your pack/pocket and carry it out."
268,2017-01-18,['hiking'],"Trail is in good shape with mostly packed snow, but was a bit icy on the descent. Wear yaktrax if you've got 'em! Car to car in 1:50 with a 5-10 min break at the top."
269,2017-01-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, snow packed basically the entire way. I wore yak tracks which were helpful on the way down. There's nothing technical about this trail, but the length and consistent elevation gain make it moderately difficult."
270,2017-01-17,['hiking'],"This was my first time on the trail (MLK holiday). It took us about 4 hours round trip and there were people faster and slower than us. I would rate this as moderate-difficult. The bottom and top were hardest (incline) and the middle was much easier. I wore yak-trax and I would DEFINITELY suggest them to anyone hiking in the winter. My husband wore running shoes and things got a little dicey on the way down, especially at the top. All in all this was a great trail and we will be back in the spring/summer. Oh, the app says this is 5.3 mi but the trailhead says 3.0 to the summit; add in the .5 mile through the campground and this is more like a 7 mi RT hike."
271,2016-12-21,['snowshoeing'],Great place to hike year round! This podcast sums it up pretty well: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/snowshoeing-snow-friendly/id1142336821?i=1000379208229&mt=2
272,2016-12-12,['hiking'],Did this hike yesterday morning and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it.  I would definitely not rate this as a difficult hike. The incline really isn't that bad and it's relatively short. The trails were a bit icy in the beginning but it got better as we got closer to the peak. The views were much better than I expected. I would recommend this one for sure. Made it up and back to the car in just over 3 hours. Only saw 15-20 people on the trail. Had the peak to ourselves the entire 15 minutes we stayed up there.
273,2016-11-20,['hiking'],"I am in moderate shape and I was able to complete this in 4.5 hours. there was a major snow storm two days prior so the trail was very icy. I am not the thinnest girl, but I got knocked over by the wind gust a few times. I took lots of 2 minute breaks. I love this trail because it has a steady incline. I hiked back in the dark without a headlamp, so I took my time to avoid ""eating it."" =p"
274,2016-11-19,['hiking'],"Up and down in 2:15 hrs at moderate speed. I'm more of a scenic hiker, so the peak wasn't the most fulfilling experience."
275,2016-11-04,['hiking'],Decent hike with a consistent ascent.  Last mile or so steeper so it will give your legs a good workout. A bit of scrambling but nothing hard. Great views from the top. Took about 3 hrs 15 min up/back with a 15-20 minute break at the top. Not many people on the path and a few dogs.  About 6 miles RT from the road since you can't drive up to the TH
276,2016-10-31,['hiking'],"This hike is tough.  I hike very often and this was difficult for me.  The reward at the top is a beautiful view of the whole valley and it is gorgeous.  I very much enjoyed the hike, although towards the end I felt it was more like rock climbing than hiking.  It gets very steep about a mile from the top.  We timed ourselves and we were up and back in 3 hours and 55 min (with about a 15 min break at the summit)."
277,2016-10-31,['hiking'],"This is a long-ish trail with a relatively gentle incline. Great for beginner hikers that want to step up their game. It does get a bit tougher near the end with a few scrambles, nothing too technical though.

Would give it 5 stars except it was quite crowded."
278,2016-10-24,['hiking'],
279,2016-10-11,[''],"We did this later in the evening to get a good sunset view. It was awesome. The lighting right after the sun sets is the best for pictures. The colors come alive. As for the hike itself, it was definitely a good elevation gain. The switch backs aren't bad. And the last mile is pretty spectacular scenery so you don't mind the steeper climb to the top. We had a great time!"
280,2016-10-07,['hiking'],This one is definitely not for the faint of heart. I learned the hard way you need to build up to this one if you are a  beginning hiker such as myself. Other than that it is a great hike and is beautiful for the last mile or so before the top. Got some great pictures from around the peak. Would definitely recommend for the enthusiast.
281,2016-10-02,['hiking'],O did a track with my husband and his son. Track easy and beautyful images.
282,2016-09-18,['hiking'],Last bit is tougher than I thought it would be.   Nice day hike.
283,2016-09-14,[''],Steep trail with great views as you ascend. Not for the faint of condition! Bring water and a snack.
284,2016-09-11,['hiking'],This is an intense hike with lots of steep inclines so make sure you're in good shape. It has a view access pints to the trail head so make sure you come back the way you went up so you don't have to walk on the road back to your car. The view at the top is well worth the climb!
285,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"I would rate this as more moderate than hard.  I guess it's a little steep near the top, but for the most part is a well graded, excellent trail.  In the lower reaches there is quite a bit of shade, not so much near the top.  A great peak hike when the higher summits are hiding under snow.  A much nicer trail than the route from the W side."
286,2016-09-04,[''],Fairly difficult.  Shaded for the first part then pretty open through the summit.  Worth doing but you will work.  Great views!
287,2016-09-03,[''],"Very satisfied with the outcome of this hike! pretty steep, but the view at the peak is gorgeous"
288,2016-08-28,[''],Nice hike
289,2016-08-15,[''],Good elevation change. Tough but worth it.
290,2016-08-15,['hiking'],Great trail with awesome overlooks of both Parley's and the Salt Lake Valley.
291,2016-08-01,['hiking'],hard but great
292,2016-07-30,['hiking'],Gps from the road to the top was 4.1 miles. Not a terrible elevation change but it was steady. Near the top it got pretty steep. Some sections requiring some scrambling. Hard but worth the views. Descent was hot 95+ degrees. My mistake was not enough water. Had some issues with dehydration and heat exhaustion the last mile or so. Still worth all the pain. I will do it again.
293,2016-07-29,['hiking'],I found this hike a good challenge with rewarding views. It feels good to say you hiked to the top of the mountain. The only disappointment was the bugs at the very top. There were so many and they were buzzing so loud you could not really sit and enjoy the view. It was great to be able to see out in all directions. I did a panoramic picture but it stops before you get the full 360 view. If you could have sat and enjoyed a break at the top I would have rated 5 stars.
294,2016-07-28,[''],Awesome hike. Great views. Wildlife encounters. Was stellar.
295,2016-07-20,['hiking'],"I began this late afternoon hike with my GSD from Burch Hollow Trailhead instead of Church Fork, following the signs for Grandeur Peak. It takes you about 1.6 miles West along the Pipeline Trail before you cross the river and turn right to begin (what I would consider) the start of Grandeur Peak Trail (3 miles from this point). 

The elevation gain begins mildly and is very peaceful following along the river. As you progress the trail gets more intense with very steep switchbacks leading you to the top of the mountain. Towards the peak, there are some jagged rocks you have to climb over but nothing my 6.5 month (61 pound) GSD couldn't get over (or down) himself. We ran into 2 people going up the trail, about 6 people at the peak and a couple of small groups going down. 

I hiked this while battling a deep chest cough/cold, so it felt like an incredibly brutal death trail, although I imagine it's still a solid workout otherwise. I had to stop A LOT to catch my breath and we both drank a lot of water. I'd highly recommend bug spray and keep watch for snakes as we almost stepped on a thin black one coming down. 

Round trip we probably hiked 9.5 miles; 3 hours up and 2 down, making it to the car just after sunset. There are easier hikes for similar views of the valley (like Living Room) but if you want the solitude, exercise and varying terrain (river, wildflowers, mountain canopy)...this is the hike for you!"
296,2016-07-16,['hiking'],"Pretty nice hike. At this time of the year, I would not recommend doing it in the heat of the day. The high was 97 today and it was 90+ the entire time we were hiking, and the lower, shady part following the stream is very humid. Steeper and harder than expected, but the heat was an additional challenge. I only brought 1 liter of water and could've gone with 1.5 - 2L to avoid minor dehydration. I saw several snakes slither away beside the trail, all were fairly small and were not rattlesnakes, they were likely harmless but it can spook you. The views from the top are expansive and include I-80, Mountain Dell, the Millcreek Ridgeline, Mount Olympus, Wildcat Ridge (Mount Olympus to Mt. Raymond), Salt Lake Valley, Antelope Island, Stansbury Island, the Oquirrh range, and what appeared to be a brief glimpse of the further west Stansbury Range. The air pollution can be a bit of a disappointment though.
Note on water: If you are running low or need water, just above the trailhead parking lot the stream runs through the trail. Pay attention and you will see a pipe with water flowing out of it. This is a natural spring that can provide cool water that is GENERALLY safe to drink unfiltered. Fill your bottle only with the water flowing out of the pipe and consume at your own risk."
297,2016-07-09,[''],This was a lot harder than I thought it would be but the views were worth it! Don't recommend hiking this alone for sunset though. The track back in the dark is lonely and spooky 
298,2016-06-28,['hiking'],"I really enjoyed this hike. It was challenging enough that I didn't get bored and offered a wonderful view of our salty city once I made it to the peak. Also not a terribly long hike, would be great to catch the sunset from the top. Will do again!"
299,2016-06-25,[''],Great hike with amazing view.
300,2016-06-14,['hiking'],Great hike with some nice inclines. it starts out under tree cover and then you are out in the sun..so be prepared. The final ascent to the peak is easy so keep going!
301,2016-06-13,[''],Went in the evening and watched the sunset. It was beautiful! Bring flashlights if you do cause it got pretty dark on the way back.
302,2016-06-09,['hiking'],"To avoid crowds, I would suggest starting early if you can. It is truly a beautiful hike. The last stretch from the saddle to the summit is the most challenging part, and if you are there at mid day or late afternoon, the sun will really beat down on you, so wear sunscreen and bring lots of water. Also, you may run into some biting flies, so bug spray can be handy. The views of the Salt Lake valley are wonderful, and once you pass the tree-line about half way up, you get lovely views of Mill Creek Canyon as well. Definitely worth it!"
303,2016-06-04,[''],Super nice hike.  Gets exposed Enroute to summit.  Bring water.  Awesome views from top.
304,2016-06-04,['hiking'],"Great trail...my wife, 10 yr old daughter, and I did it round trip in 4 hrs which included a 30 min lunch on top.  It was 54 degrees when we started at 8:15 am and 85 when we got to our truck at 12:15.  Start early to ensure parking and a cool morning.

This hike is not 2.3 each way.  There's a sign that says 3 miles about .2 miles in.  My Apple Watch measured 3 miles to the nose from the top to the sign.  It can nearly be 7 miles round-trip.

Bring lots of water, a snack, and enjoy the view of the whole Salt Lake valley!!!"
305,2016-05-31,[''],"Can get very crowded on nice weekend days, but it is pretty much the fastest route to some of the best views of the Salt Lake Valley.  Much more forgiving than the brutally steep/higher/exposed western approach."
306,2016-05-31,[''],Beautiful Views
307,2016-05-30,[''],"Beautiful views! Tons of people, but that was a given bec the holiday weekend."
308,2016-05-29,['hiking'],"Definately strenuous for the first part, but as you reach the switch backs trail isnt as steep. It took us 2.5 hours to get up because we were going at snails pace, way down was pretty quick ~1hr."
309,2016-05-28,['hiking'],"A must hike trail in Millcreek! Makes a great ""first-time"" if you've never hiked a summit before, but is also difficult enough to keep more experienced hikers coming back. Gorgeous views the whole way, with a killer view at the top! Loses a star for the heavy amount of traffic, otherwise a great hike."
310,2016-05-21,['hiking'],"Hike was a cake walk and very fun. Parking at the trail head is limited in stalls, unless you have a picnic spot. If not, then you're stuck parking on the side of the road. 

The trail could use less dog crap bags on the side of the trails. Counted at least 15 or so. Every dog we saw was way nice. Dogs are great, just don't leave their poop in plan sight so almost step on. 

Hiked Mount Olympus yesterday, so on sore legs, this hike was perfect."
311,2016-05-21,[''],"Awesome trail, about half way up crossing the ridge the view is incredible!!"
312,2016-05-15,['hiking'],"So fun, great views!"
313,2016-05-12,['hiking'],"First hike for of the year. Great hike, awesome views."
314,2016-05-10,['hiking'],This steep hike is worth the effort. There was some rain today causing some mud but nothing to worry about. Beautiful views await you at the saddle and top.
315,2016-05-03,['hiking'],Really amazing! Pretty steep but there were amazing views the whole time. No snow which was a nice surprise. High recommend it! Brought my pups and they loved it!!!
316,2016-04-30,[''],steep and fun. Wasatch Blvd side
317,2016-04-29,['hiking'],Great hike! Steep but worth it! Snow patches at the top but nothing that will keep you from going to the top.
318,2016-04-26,[''],"Worth the hike in the end. Definitely wouldn't bring children, really hard hike for more experienced people. Uphill the entire time. Towards the end you are climbing across a peak to the big peak. Very tiring, but well worth it at the end. Could see the entire salt lake valley."
319,2016-04-19,[''],Beautiful. Just a little snow. Did it in sneakers.
320,2016-04-18,['hiking'],"great hike, and beautiful view from thw top."
321,2016-04-11,['hiking'],"Took about 5-hours.  Steep climb on loose rocks for about 1-mile.  Snow on last 1/4 mile.  Peak views overlooking SLC.  No water provided along trail, bathrooms only at entrance."
322,2016-04-03,['hiking'],"Wonderful day to be outside.  You can hike all but the last 4th of a mile or so, without any snow.   Trail is mostly dry, except for a few muddy spots, but nothing to worry about.  Watch out for crappy dog owners that could care less about cleanup and wondering dogs."
323,2016-03-13,[''],A little cool but mainly dirt until last 3/4 mile from the peak.
324,2016-03-12,['hiking'],"Great hike and not too long. Beware if you go in the summer months, the trail does lack shade- you will be in the sun for majority of the hike. I would like to do this one again in the winter!"
325,2016-02-07,[''],Amazing!!!
326,2016-01-25,['hiking'],"Hiked from Church Fork. The majority of the trail was packed down. I had micro spikes but noticed several others with just hiking boots and one guy with trail running shoes.  I said the majority of the trail was packed down but the last half mile was not. The trail became very narrow and stepping off trail produced an instant post-hole at least knee high. 

The final switchback was not packed down at all and one guy went waist deep. Wide receiver sized individuals had minor issues but linebacker sized players tended to sink waist deep as previously stated.  

Overall a very nice day for a hike."
327,2015-12-13,['hiking'],Hiked the West face to Grandeur Peak then Down this trail to Church Fork. Trail had a couple inches of snow but not enough for snowshoes. Used chains to insure good footing
328,2015-12-12,['hiking'],Hiked up the west face and down this trail. Great views from the top when the clouds were not blocking the view. Brought snowshoes and chains but used just the chains.
329,2015-10-31,['hiking'],great day for hike.
330,2015-10-06,['trail running'],"The trail head from Wasatch Blvd is well marked. There are garbage bins and water fountain to use. 
The climb is very steep. It is fully exposed. So be prepared. A pair of quality hiking or trail running shoes are recommended. The traction is better when slight wet. 

The trail going the opposite side of the peak is OK. It is not very runnable either. A lot of debris and roots. Trail is not well marked at points. I was lost a couple of times. 

The worst section would be from the viewpoint at the end of the pipeline trail to the trail head on Wasatch Ave. It is not well established. It is hard to see from time to time. I would not run on it again."
331,2015-10-05,['hiking'],"There are two trails to this peak, a free trail head at the start by a neighborhood, and the other trail head in the canyon.   Long hike, dog friendly, and very fun.    A view that makes you feel on top of the world.  My advice is find time for this trail and make sure you get to the top of the peak, you wont regret it."
332,2015-09-27,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike - about 1/2 covered, 1/2 exposed. Starting early helped quite a bit with the heat as this can be a warm one being closer to the city and lower elevation than others up the canyons. The hike starts in a cool, covered gulch, then sidehills, and then reaches a ridge which takes you to the top."
333,2015-09-24,['hiking'],"This was a great hike - although I found it very difficult. The first part of the trail follows the creek and is a good wide and even trail, once you leave the creek and start up the mountains, things change dramatically. The trail becomes narrow, uneven and quite steep in places, particularly toward the peak. That being said, the views are amazing!!"
334,2015-09-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful view of foliage, lovely stream, and an amazing view!"
335,2015-08-24,['hiking'],Its one of my favorite hikes. View is amazing!!
336,2015-08-08,['hiking'],"A nice challenge for hiking.  Not too bad, but it has its steep areas.  The views are to die for though.  I take two pairs of socks to avoid blisters as my toes/feet get a beating."
337,2015-07-27,['hiking'],It's not as hard as Olympus but offers the same beautiful view. There is also more shade than Olympus.
338,2015-07-20,['hiking'],"I only go there in the spring before other trails in the Wasatch are snow/mud free. Okay trail, if you don't mind dog poop."
339,2015-07-17,[''],"Very steep all the way to the top. Nearly no shade if you do not go through Church Fork.

Once on top you are rewarded by a panoramic view of the valley and some cool breeze. Try to get down via the less steep route if possible."
340,2015-07-16,['hiking'],Love it!
341,2015-07-07,['trail running'],This is a great trail to run/hike in the morning before work. If you push yourself you can finish in less than 2 hours.
342,2015-07-03,['hiking'],"Too many flying bugs and snakes for my liking but amazing views at the top. The trail is also dog friendly but there was dog poop every few hundred ft or so. Moderate hike, nothing too difficult."
343,2015-06-28,['bird watching'],"The trailhead was a little tricky to find, you have to pull into a picnic area just past the scout camps on the north side of the road then follow the picnic area's road all the way to the top.  The trail gets a little steep and there's a couple rattlesnakes up there so it might be a good idea to wear long pants and leave the kids at home.  Lots of litter and graffiti for the first mile or so but after that it gets really pretty really quick."
344,2015-06-24,['hiking'],This was my first hike in Utah not being acclimated and it was tough but do able. Gorgeous views at the top. On one side you have the city and the other you have mountains. Great moderate day hike!
345,2015-06-22,[''],"Love the views from the peak, I do this hike at least a few times a year. Too steep for bikes and there is a stream for 1/3, so it's always a good bet with my dogs. Second half is all exposed, so start early or save this for cooler days."
346,2015-06-09,['hiking'],"Well marked trail that goes up and up and up.  The climb is steady and exposed to the elements for about the last third of the hike.  The temps were in the low 60s, so the sunshine felt great.  In summer, the direct sun could be a little uncomfortable.  As a small bonus, you can cut off some of the uphill if you wait until the picnic area opens and drive up to the trail head. "
347,2015-06-02,[''],"Great views and a good, short hike. Went on Sunday afternoon and there was a rattlesnake in the upper section after the trail narrows and resumes climbing. Much of it is exposed, so sunscreen is a must."
348,2015-06-01,[''],This is a challenging trail! Great way to spend a Sunday morning!
349,2015-05-29,['hiking'],"Anyone encounter rattlesnakes  in Millcreek yet, specifically this trial?"
350,2015-05-26,['hiking'],"This is my favorite cardio spot near the valley! Nice heart pumping hike. Not too hard, not too easy. I feel confident taking my dog on this hike as there are no sketchy parts, and there is usually plenty of socializing for him up top (this hike allows off-leash dogs on odd numbered days of the month) which he loves.  Take plenty of water and/or hike early because there are plenty of steep climbs in direct sun. I definitely recommend this hike, and do it as often as possible!"
351,2015-05-25,[''],"The skies cleared as we started this hike from Church Fork! Gorgeous , muddy and a little tough! Worth every out of breath moment!"
352,2015-05-23,[''],"Awesome trail, great challenge, excellent views."
353,2015-05-23,['hiking'],A bit of a strenuous hike but eautiful views from the summit!
354,2015-05-02,['hiking'],"The Church Fork Trail (accessible in Mill Creek Canyon) is typically the most used route to Grandeur Peak. It's a fairly strenuous hike, and there are many areas that are exposed the second half of the hike, so wear your sunscreen and bring plenty of water with you. This is a beautiful hike, and the views from the summit are impressive, overlooking SLC, and beautiful snowcovered peaks to the south. This trail is dog friendly, leashed on even days/off leash on odd days (although pretty much everyone had their dogs unleashed on even days...). Be prepared to pay $3.00 at the gate up Mill Creek Canyon, even if you have a National Annual Pass, due to some county road bullshit."
355,2015-05-01,['hiking'],"We took Church Fork Trail. Trail conditions were good. Views of Mt Aire, Raymond and Olympus are very nice. To the North you can spot Francis and Ben Lomond. Very nice hike that can be a good trail run too. Will be back for another visit in the future."
356,2015-03-20,['hiking'],"I went up from Church Fork Trailhead. It was a nice hike, relatively easy. There was some hard-packed snow/ice near the top. I had microspikes and used them, but they weren't necessary. There were some decent views of the valley and peaks to the east."
357,2015-03-13,['hiking'],"Nice trail!  I entered at the Church Fork trailhead which is mostly shaded during the first half of the track.  It was very muddy because of the rain as well as the run-off which, in many places streams right down the middle of the trail.  If dry, this trail is moderately difficult but if you're hiking through snow it's more demanding, hence the rating I chose.  

There are some great views on the way up so make sure to look around you and take it all in.  The summit is fantastic!  Some reviewers recommend taking the west trailhead entrance which I have never done.  However, I met another hiker at the summit who had done both and he far prefers the Church Fork trail because it's secluded without the constant city noises."
358,2014-09-05,['hiking'],Beautiful view!
359,2014-08-21,[''],It's a classic with a great view. Perfect early season training hike for bigger peaks. Also a great Winter escape...bring snowshoes if there has been a recent storm.
360,2014-07-29,[''],"Grandeur is a great warm up or test before attempting any of the Wasatch's bigger peaks. Warning: It's popular, south facing, and can be crowded.  Best times are fall (early spring can be done, first half mile will be slimy though, and snow may be present at the top)  If you attempt it mid-day, bring enough water as the trail can be hot.  Get up early if you want some peace and quiet, better yet, bring a headlamp for the descent. The peak is a great place to watch the sunset to the west. 

Pros: Very accessible, first 3/4 mile is shady, good view of the city, decent views of the Wasatch to the south while hiking (after the first mile)
Cons: Pretty crowded, first 3/4 mile can be muddy in spring or after rain."
361,2014-06-30,['hiking'],"I really liked this shady hike up to Grandeur. Hot in the valley but because of the time of day we were in shade all the way to the summit. A little sketchy on the way down as it was getting dark, but  a great hike. We only saw 3 other hikers on a June Sunday afternoon.Started at 5 pm got down around 9:30 we had 2 kids and a few of us aren't in the best shape."
362,2014-06-17,['hiking'],"Not the prettiest hike in the Wasatch, but it is nice and close in, good for exercise.  I hiked up the West side (steeper, more exposed), and met someone on top who agreed to shuttle me to my car, so went down the East side, which is nicer.  The creek near the bottom is pretty, and there is some shade, with not quite such a relentless burn on the elevation."
363,2014-06-12,['hiking'],All up hill on this one.  The incline is pretty moderate until you get close to the peak.  The views of the canyon are awesome.  The spring wild flowers were in full bloom which was nice.  Going up was a good work out but be careful coming down some loose rocks could send you for a tumble.  It was a bit windy at the top wish i had brought a long sleeve shirt.  Don't forget the bug spray on this one...wow a lot of bugs and bees.  I liked it a lot...did not love it.  Pretty views from the top.
364,2014-06-12,[''],"Love this hike.  Pretty exhausting honestly.  It's a fairly prominent peak on the front side.  You can pretty much see it from anywhere.  Therefore the views are incredible.  Trail is in great shape and is easy to follow.  Once you get to the saddle, another 20 min you'll be standing on the summit.  I used the Church Fork trail head.  There is also an even steeper trail that starts from 3300 Wasatch blvd.  Do it."
365,2014-06-07,['hiking'],"Ascended today via the Church Fork route, took three of us an hour and forty-five minutes to reach the peak, and right around an hour to descend. I am not a hardcore hiker but more of a weekend warrior, and I don't consider this type of hike overly challenging. The views were spectacular, and neat to see Gobbler's/Raymond from the other side where I'd been the week before. It was pretty quiet on the way up, and by the time we'd decided to head back there were lots of people at the summit and plenty more on the trail below. As I'm told, it's frequently used, so a solitary experience could be hard to achieve, maybe mid-week? The wildflowers are just now starting to explode, so there's plenty to see and smell for sure! I'm going to add this one to my spring list, and would love to do it earlier when a little snow remained in places. Decent hike!"
366,2014-06-07,['hiking'],"First complete ascent on Grandeur via the West trail (city side).  Granduer via Church Fork was the first hike I ever did, so to finally accomplish the summit via the more challenging west route is very significant (particularly growing up blocks away seeing this west facing mountain). 

As far as stats: I took the more challenging south route which is notably steeper albeit shorter (I am still working out if this is considered the center trail or if this is the far south trail, as I have read that there is one more trail further south called the Dragons Tail [which would be the the rocky spine] ).  This steep south (tbd center) trail can be looped to the north and return to the parking lot or vice versa. The nike app was approximately a little over one mile to the the junction where these two trails (far north) meet and then ascend directly east to the summit of Grandeur.   It took me 2.5 hours to ascend what the nike app said was 2.31 miles to the summit, and about 1.5 hours to descend.  There were no rattlesnakes today but no reason to lack vigilence. 
Today (6/6/14) there was an abundance of flowers, at least six distinct different varieties of in bloom and the bees plentiful. I did see my first genuine sego lily!  About time. Also, two piles of relatively fresh scat were sited.  Very steady and slow going.  The view directly east was spectacular - nothing but proper green Wasatch.  Delighted to have finally achieved the Western approach."
367,2014-05-17,['hiking'],"This is a great hike, love the terrain and elevations you go threw! Heard a lot about this trail and thought I would give it try and at the top, the view is spectacular!!! One bad thing... trail runners...not very good etiquette when walking up the trail and and a trail runner shoves me aside with his forearm to get threw!!! would I do this trail again, ehh!"
368,2014-03-30,['hiking'],"good hike.  just finished it.  took me two hours to get up from church creek, and one hour to get back down.  great views from the top.  the top third was covered in snow."
369,2013-11-09,[''],"Being a newbie, this hike was challenging. I can count on one hnad the number of times that I wasn't leaning into the trail. I guess this is what summit/peak hiking is all about. Great hike. Great views from the peak. Definitely worth the seat."
370,2013-10-21,['hiking'],Love this hike! The views are spectacular from up top. Very hot in summer! Start early or go in the fall!
371,2013-10-18,['hiking'],Good hike but LOTS of people on this trail. View at top is nice.
372,2013-10-13,['hiking'],"Provides a great view  of the salt lake valley.  The trail is in good shape, and ranged from easy and smooth to very steep and rocky.  The trailhead at Church Fork is obstructed by construction going on in the picnic area.  Just park on the road and walk up through the work area, Bring a lunch and enjoy a great view at the top"
373,2013-08-22,['hiking'],Hiked this trail with a youth group. The view from the top if the peak of the Sale Lake valley is beautiful
374,2013-08-20,['hiking'],"Love this hike.  One of the best views I have seen of the salt lake valley.   You get one hefty reward for a relatively short and moderate hike.   

As a large portion of this trail is pretty exposed, I highly recommend starting early and bringing extra water.  "
375,2013-08-17,['hiking'],Did this hike yesterday before work. I started from the road because it was very early and the gate was not open. It took me about 4.5 hrs. My track showed 6.84 miles round trip. I only saw a couple other people until I was nearly back to the road. Great hike. Elevation change was about 3400ft on my tracker. Not sure if it was right. Now I need to figure out what peak is next. I want to work my way up to the big ones.
376,2013-08-08,['hiking'],"Enjoyed this short, morning hike in mid-September. Finished in about 4 hours taking it easy. Trail was clearly marked and easy to follow. Saw few hikers in the morning so the solitude was nice. Being a Mill Creek Canyon trail it is dog friendly. This is the hike you want for beautiful fall colors and has a great valley view at the summit. "
377,2013-07-30,['hiking'],Probably the best views for the easy difficulty level in the salt lake area. Decent amounts of shade on beginning of trail. Watch out for rattle snakes. Rewarding views and comfortable sitting area at summit to eat lunch and relax. 
378,2013-07-14,['hiking'],"If you move to Salt Lake City and you hike this is probably the first mountain you look up at and say, ""I wonder how I can get up there?""  Great views and not too difficult for a peak."
379,2013-06-10,['hiking'],"Hiking this trail from the front face of the mountain proved to be a difficult but doable. The view from the top was well worth the pain. Did the hike at night time to see the sun set, incredible views of the valley from the top. "
380,2012-11-12,['hiking'],"Have been hiking this since I was 12, I am 28 now, and it never gets old. such a fantastic hike with a fantastic view. I recommend it for everyone"
381,2012-10-02,['hiking'],Good hike. Makes you feel like you've accomplished something.  I will definitely climb this one again.
382,2012-08-25,['hiking'],"Did this as a Sunrise hike, starting from the Church Fork Trailhead.  Started at 4:30 in the morning, and timed it so we made it to the peak just as the Sun was rising over Mount Aire to the East.  It was an awesome view.  It was interesting coming back down after the Sun had already come up, as we had never been on this trail before, and we could see how different it looked in the light!"
383,2012-08-03,['hiking'],"This review applies to the Church Fork trailhead:
 is NOT a difficult hike...unless you take the trailhead at the north end of Wasatch Boulevard. That is a difficult hike! I used to rage the Church Fork trail every Friday, and I could make it to the top in 50 minutes, and back in 30. 

"
384,2012-07-26,['hiking'],"This trail is a great trail, beautiful views, but hot and has a very large elevation gain. It is a trail that is in three basic sections (almost thirds, but they're not equal): first is the length along the stream that is shaded and cool. Next is the switchbacks that are somewhat shaded, get hotter, and offer stunning views of Millcreek canyon. Finally, the section over the saddle gets less protected and even hotter, but once you reach the top, there are stunning views of the whole Salt Lake valley, even of the University of Utah. Be sure to bring plenty of water and get there early (There is a small parking lot at the trailhead, or you have to park out on the road. "
385,2012-04-28,['hiking'],"I liked this trail a lot. Plenty of steeper spots, but also levels out on occasion. Lots of switchbacks, which are cool. Trail was in good condition for April. Short section of loose(ish) small rocks. Also a surprising amount of people. I think the crowds will only get worse once summer is in full swing, so get there early. Easy peak to bag, no scrambling, excellent view of the valley. I'll be doing it again (and probably again)."
386,2011-07-14,['hiking'],"Go early. Little to no cover on trail and it gets very hot late morning thru afternoon. Terriffic views of the entire Salt Lake Valley from the summit; and once you're down, you can easily pick grandeur out of the beautiful mountain skyline, and point to it while bragging to your friends: ""I've climbed that mountain."""
387,2011-05-17,['hiking'],"Did this one with my daughter.  It was a hot, dry day, and on the hike you're climbing the up the side of a bowl, which seems to compound the heat.  We saw several granddads with their grandkids.  That kept me going, figuring if they could do it, so could I.  Well, the hike proved to me just how out-of-shape I was.  So, I suggest bringing *lots* of water, energy snacks, and trekking poles.  It was a really nice view from the top, though, so it was worth it."
