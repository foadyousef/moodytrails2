So overall this trail is super hard to follow. 
At first you think dang this is going to be nice. 
As long as you dont get lost in the first .10th of a mile on the wrong turn off. Then its pretty good till after the first waterfall ""if youd call it that since you can only view it from a distance"".
Then its pretty much and uphill battle with the overgrowth and rockiness of the terrain. Almost stepped on a few snakes.
A few overlooks if you can see through the brush to a decent view. But then it just dead ends as this little spring at about 1.25 miles up. You can see that at one point it went further. But i think with proper maintenance and a destination this trail may be more entertaining. "

Come summer it is very overgrown and long pants are recommended.  It doesn't seem to get much use and is a good trail if you're just looking for some seclusion without going far."

5,2019-05-25,['hiking'],"The trail was maintained well enough to know where to go. It was all uphill so frequent breaks are needed. Overall, pretty doable, just pace yourself and enjoy the greenery. "
6,2019-04-21,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky']","I hiked this trail today with my husband and it was ROUGH. It was a trail he has hiked many years ago and since then it has definitely gotten forgotten and is off the path a ways. 
The good things of this trail is that the river along the trail is beautiful, my dog loved the trail, it was an easy trail to see and follow and many options to go off the path, it has a natural spring that is delicious, and it is shady. The downsides are that it is VERY VERY Steep and rocky.  Rocks are everywhere on the path it's hard to keep your footing.. Should be rated a Hard rating. I am not an experienced hiker, but I got through it, although it was a tough time. I got to the massive rock with the view and had to turn back. My legs and feet were done. I'll be going back to continue the trail and see what beauty my husband says lies ahead passed the ""end"" of the trail. "
7,2019-04-18,['hiking'],Nice after work trail. Pretty steep going at the start. Lots of different ways to shoot off the track I took and explore more.
8,2018-08-26,[''],"This trail was pretty over grown in places and got pretty steep. There were a few times we had to guess which way to go, but ended up making it to the end. We were a little disappointed with how it ended so we climbed up a little higher (made our own trail) and had a great view! Made it totally worth it!"
9,2018-05-25,['hiking'],"I give this hike one star for several reasons. Very first thing is the trailhead is very difficult to find.  There is no trail marker and the trailhead looks like no more than a small game path. Second the entire trail is very overgrown, lack of foot traffic and trail maintenance. This makes the trail very difficult to follow. We almost lost the trail entirely a few times, I would recommend long pants because you’ll be bush whacking most of it. And last but not least, the trail should be rated moderate/hard. It’s VERY steep most of the way up and the trail is mostly comprised of loose broken shale. ."

11,2017-07-08,[''],This trail looked like it was going to be great but once we finally found it there was too much overgrowth to get through without a machete. Based on previous reviews I assume its been growing in slowly and now it's just not usable until some brave soul clears it out.
12,2017-06-25,['hiking'],"If you go on this trail prepare for non-stop inclines and a very small trail with overgrown plants in either side.   That being said I really enjoyed myself, the best part is that I had the entire trail to myself.  I don't know if I made it to the top because I hit a point where the trail pretty much ended and I didn't know which way to go.  it was unfortunate that I didn't get to see the creek that much it rarely came into view along the trail. Honestly I would go to a different trail unless you enjoy being away from everybody."
13,2017-04-16,['hiking'],"Fun trail run, river rock crossing, foraging, views, etc."
14,2016-10-09,['hiking'],"It was a beautiful trail, but tricky to find. The ap takes you right to the trailhead, but there's no parking allowed there. You have to park where it's designated for Bonneville shoreline. There's a trail that will take you up to the trailhead for Hobbs Canyon. It's not marked. It begins just a few steps south of the dead end cul-de-sac. You'll see the Bonneville shoreline trail, which is a wider trail. It heads south. To the left of it, there's a narrower trail that heads due east. This is the Hobb's Canyon trail. It follows the north side of the river. I'll add a picture of the beginning of the trailhead to help."
15,2016-09-27,['hiking'],"Beautiful view. Went with my dog. It's a great trail. Pretty easy. She now smells bad, though."
16,2016-06-29,['hiking'],Went about 7:00 pm in 100 degree weather.  Trail is completely shaded for most of the trail so the temp did not bother us at all.  Beautiful scenery with a moderate incline.  Some of the trail has loose gravel and rocks which makes it difficult to get a firm footing when going back down the trail.  This trail does not seemed to be used much.  Parts of it were a little overgrown and We did not see even one other person for the 2+ hours we were on this trail.
17,2016-06-06,[''],"Beautiful views, strenuous.  Good workout.  Plenty of shade most of the time."
18,2016-05-15,[''],Took 8 and 10 year olds. Super pretty
19,2016-04-22,['hiking'],"It was good. However, the trail nor the trail head was marked so I didn't know where I was going, hahaha luckily the directions on this app took straight to it. There was no parking at the trailhead so we had to park back where there was parking for the bonneville trail and then walk up to the supposedly Hobbs canyon trailhead. Neighborhood houses and no parking signs at the    trailhead.  Anyway, we went past the gated area and began the hike. There were several trails that came off this trail and the Hobbs canyon trail was not marked so we just hiked and ended up on the bonneville trail. We hiked in and out 4.6 miles. The first part of the trail was exposed no shade so it was hot. But after you get into about a mile in there were trees that provided some shade. Beautiful spring flowers, sage and cherry blossom tree scents, amazing views, and the sound of the flowing creek made it a great hike regardless if we were in Hobbs canyon trail or the bonneville trail. The trail was easy to moderate difficulty, the trail had flat areas, climbs and some drops throughout the trail which was nice change ups. We shared the trail with mountain bikes and other hikers, we saw horses too. I will be doing it again and try the other trails on the area."
20,2015-08-09,['hiking'],"Decent trail, but needs more travel. The trail has clear signs of erosion control, so it's maintained, but not enough foot traffic to keep the underbrush down. I turned around at 3/4 mark because ferns had overtaken the trail. Probably much better in the fall/winter"
21,2015-04-16,[''],"This one gives you no time to rest, it starts going up right away, but during the right time of year this is a great place to view wild flowers and further up the trail are small patches of quakies and great views."
22,2015-04-15,['hiking'],"The first little bit was painful and steep, but once you got to the first rocky overlook, it all leveled out and the hike turned out to be very rewarding. I did this one in April, and there was lots of spring flowers in the meadows that provided some color."
