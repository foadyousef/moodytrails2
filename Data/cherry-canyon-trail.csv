A few ants, lovely birds, squirrels. I am happy to have had two hiking poles to help up and down some pretty steep spots."
1,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'no shade']",Went up the Cherry Canyon trail on our way to the Lone Peak summit. The best word to describe this trail is steep. The first mile you feel like you have hardly gone anywhere as you switch back up the mountain and are still looking down at the parking lot. It’s also very exposed with little or no shade. I would not want to hike it during the heat of the day. Once the trail drops into Cherry Canyon there is some shade and the scenery improves as well but then there is another steep climb out of Cherry Canyon where it meets up with the Draper Ridge trail. After that it makes its way into Bear Canyon where there is a spring to fill your water bottles. I would still recommend filtering it just to remove sediment and debris though it’s probably safe to drink right from the spring. You will have another steep climb to get out of Bear Canyon but the scenery is spectacular. At the top of the ridge you will cross the Trail of the Eagle going down to the Orson Smith trailhead. Don’t go down that way if you don’t enjoy bushwhacking and trail hunting!! After that the trail descends into the upper section of Lower Willow canyon through thick pine forest until it comes out in a small meadow. The trail is washed out and difficult to follow from here but you make your way up the meadow 100 yards or so until it levels out and then you will see the Outlaw Cabin on your right through the trees. The trail continues on to the summit right behind the cabin and eventually meets up with the trail coming from Jacobs Ladder below the Lone Peak cirque. From there you just make your way up the cirque towards the north ridge of the peak. There are rock cairns in places but the way is obvious. Overall this is a spectacular trail with amazing scenery but it is very steep and not for inexperienced hikers in my opinion.

5,2017-11-25,['hiking'],Perfect day to hike Cherry Canyon. It was difficult but worth it. The first few miles are hard but it does ease up.
6,2017-10-22,[''],Love this spot. Took my five kids and we worked up the trail pretty easily. Coming down the trail is pretty slippery and the kids slipped a few times but they loved the views. You weave in and out of covered brush areas and open ridge line. Really run. I take family here from out of town. Fun fun fun.

Great trail, views and alpine setting all withing 25 minutes from home to trail. Returned back to the trail-head via the Trail of the Eagle trail turning this into a nice loop hike"
9,2017-07-04,['hiking'],"Sunday hike to Lone Peak started at 0615 am and went well up to Lone Peak basin. Started back down should have filled up a water bottle at the log cabin. brought 3 liters of water ran out about last 2 hrs. also on the way down saw in the distance Eagle Trail thought that would be a more direct route down big mistake. after bushwaking my way over to the trail which was a 1/4 mile away I worked my way down. the trail is over grown with roots, old stump, branchs that stick out all designed to trip you. at times could not see the trail very over grown. fell 12 times or there about lost count. had to go by bear cyn and gets some water.should have stayed with Cherry cyn trail!!!"
10,2017-06-21,[''],Nice hike.  need to push through  the first 30 minutes
11,2017-06-10,['hiking'],Great trail and lightly trafficked so you rarely see another hiker.  The views are great the whole way and while it is very strenuous it's not over the top.   Start early.

13,2016-08-27,[''],This trail is a trash kicker but you can get all the way to outlaw cabin. Follow my recorded trail to get there.  You can even access lone peak from outlaw cabin
14,2016-05-24,['hiking'],"This trail kicked my butt but it was well worth it. Once you get up to the top rocky area, the views are spectacular. You can see from Antelope Island to Utah Lake. The first part of the hike is mostly brush but as you get towards the top, there are some great places where you feel like you are going through tree tunnels."
