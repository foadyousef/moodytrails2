After that, there are parts with a lot of elevation change and the crowds really thinned out. The first half mile has very little shade but after that you spend a good amount of time in a tree line or close to 10k feet so the heat wasn’t too bad. There was some sand towards the top which was a little challenging, but overall this is a great hike if you are looking for a challenge that won’t take all day."

2,2019-08-22,['hiking'],"AWESOME hike! (Probably one of my favorites)  Weather was slightly overcast, steady breeze, and temps were cooler, which made for perfect hiking conditions and no mosquitos.  Loved the lakes....the view from the top is magnificent.  Was surprised by the sand on trail toward the top....was steep in places, so glad I took my poles.  Wildflowers were beautiful...we also saw a momma moose and her cubs, deer, and chipmunks.  Not many people on the hike...had the summit all to ourselves.  Highly recommend."

4,2019-08-09,['hiking'],Love love love this trail! Beautiful wildflowers and amazing views. Had the peak to ourselves too!
5,2019-08-09,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Started at the Brighton parking area and went up to the crest just below Sunset Peak. You pass 3 beautiful lakes. It’s nice the whole way so you’re fine turning around wherever. 

In mid August about 2 miles in, maybe 200 yards of the trail has water running down it. You’re basically walking through a small creek. We started early but by 11 AM there were a lot of people coming as we were coming down.

Lots of bugs.

There are several forks so it’s a good idea to have the route downloaded. 

The drive up is beautiful."

7,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Great trail. Mosquitos were present today, but not unmanageable. They stayed away with some bug spray and were mostly only present near the lakes. "
8,2019-07-31,"['hiking', 'bugs']",fun little hike but the mosquitos are out of control. lots of bug spray is needed. large crowds also but almost nobody at the peak
9,2019-07-29,"['hiking', 'bugs']",This was my first peak bagged and it was a great one. I have a fear of heights but none of the areas made me too nervous. I used hiking poles and that helped a lot with the descent. There were tons of mosquitos by the lakes. We all wore bug spray but still got bitten a ton.

11,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Phenomenal and not too crowded on a Saturday afternoon.
12,2019-07-20,['hiking'],7/20/19. Amazing views all along the trail all the up. Great look out of all three lakes at the peak. Not too steep. Took us 3 hours. Great hike with a lot of people on the trail up to Lake Mary but after that not as many. A few spots of mud and a little bit of snow but easily passable.

14,2019-07-15,['hiking'],Love this peak - such an easy summit to bag with a 360 degree view! One of my go to's hikes! Lots of lady bugs!
15,2019-07-13,['hiking'],Love this hike!! The trail is hard to stay on after the 2nd Lake because of snow. But past Catherine’s Lake it was pretty clear with patches here and there.

17,2018-09-16,[''],The views at the top are fantastic. It wasn't too difficult because of many flat parts which allow you to catch your breath while hiking. Fine hike for most everyone.
18,2018-08-11,[''],"Great trail.  Amazing views.  Appropriately rated as moderate.  Could be difficult for kids at certain points if you go all the way to Sunset Peak.  Saw a moose, lots of chipmunks and a marmot."

20,2018-08-03,[''],I LOVED THIS HIKE!!!! Definitely would recommend. we went at sunset then hiked down in the dark. super easy hike if you are a regular hiker! super sandy once you reach the saddle. AMAZING VIEW at the top!!! short and sweet hike! go at sunset definitely
21,2018-07-20,['backpacking'],Nice for an overnight hike
22,2018-07-19,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful!  The wildflowers were abundant, lakes amazing, and a huge bull moose was out grazing near the trail."
23,2018-07-17,[''],"This was a great hike, accurately described as moderate use.  The wildflowers are starting to explode now."
24,2018-07-16,['hiking'],This loop is impossible to find just plan to do this as an out and back. I have never been lost on a trail and I couldn’t find the down section after pioneer peak to save my life. Ended up hiking over 11 miles after giving up and doing it out and back. Sunset peak is great and the whole hike is beautiful with wild flowers and lakes.
25,2018-01-20,['hiking'],Nice views especially Lake Catherine
