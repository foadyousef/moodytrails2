0,2019-08-26,['hiking'],We hiked this trail from point to point. We took two cars and left a car at Crystal Lake TH and drove to Bald Mountain TH. The hike took us around 4.5 hours. It was absolutely stunning! So many gorgeous alpine lakes. Bench Lake was probably our favorite. The wildflowers were breathtaking. Already trying to plan a day to do this one again!
1,2019-08-21,['hiking'],"The trail was very easy to follow. Pretty views. All downhill the first day. We overnighted at meadow lake. The best part of the hike was meadow like to trial lake. The views were a lot better this direction. Harder than we thought it would be and a little longer with the meadow lake cutoff of course, but definitely a moderate uinta hike. "
2,2019-07-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike with incredible lakes. Clegg, Ibantik, and Bench lakes were all especially spectacular. We  had two cars so did point-to-point. Very mild elevation gain, and we had incredible weather, getting hit of course by the classic 4:00 uinta rain!"
3,2019-07-23,['backpacking'],This trail was one of the most beautiful trails I have been on. There were a lot of fallen trees on the trail though but we were able to make it around them. The trail was a little muddy and there was some snow to cross over at the notches pass but not bad. I would definitely do this trail again. 
4,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'rocky']","I did the first half of this hike from the Bald Mountain trail head on the Notch Mountain Trail down to Meadow Lake and then hiked back out the same way since I didn't have two cars.  The trail is all down hill on the way in (except for the last half mile off the loop over to Meadow Lake).  This makes for a real slog going back up to the trail head especially when hiking all the way in and out the same day. Of course it was very beautiful and I didn't see anyone on the trail all day except when I was about 20 minutes out from the trailhead.  A bit rocky like all Uinta trails, but trail is easy to follow with no obstacles to speak of.  Great hike if you want a good workout and solitude.  Some bugs, but easily controlled with repellant."
5,2018-08-24,['horseback riding'],"Took the horses from the Bald Mountain Trailhead.  What a great ride.  A bit rocky for the horses at times but nothing too bad.  

We had hoped that we could make our way back to the Bald Mountain trailhead by bushwhacking from lake Marion to some of the unimproved 4 wheel roads showing on the map.  The deadfall was heavier than we wanted to deal with so we worked our way back to the Trail lake campground and had one rider hitchhike up to get the horse trailer.

Totaled ~6 hours with a good stop for lunch at Ibantik Lake."
6,2018-06-16,[''],"My favorite way to hike this trail on my own is to chain my bike at the Bald Mountain TH then park at Trial Lake. After hiking from Trial Lake to Bald Mountain, the bike ride back to Trial Lake on the Mirror Lake Highway is almost entirely downhill and very refreshing."
7,2018-06-09,[''],"Just completed Bald Mountain to Wall Lake and back. There’s some snow near The Notch, but it is passable and streams are low enough to cross. Lots of mud! Beautiful views at each of the many lakes we passed! Heard a mountain lion (didn’t see it and didn’t get eaten either "
8,2018-06-05,[''],"Hiked this trail today from Washington/Crystal Lake trailhead to Wall Lake and then up to the Notch and back. Several patches of snow but all easy to get over except at the very top. We had to go below the snow field and around it to the top. Trail was good - wet in many places. Views were, as always, spectacular! Great hike!"
9,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"We started this trail from the Trial Lake side on 6/31. The day was perfect and we were very excited to get to Seymour Lake on the back side. Unfortunately just before we hit Wall lake we started to hit patches of snow up to 4’ deep. Wall lake was frozen but still beautiful and had a few open spots. We continued as far up the trail as we could, but the snow kept pushing us further South West were we ended up dropping camp at Dean Lake, just below notch lake. Still a ton of snow and the lake was half frozen. If we hadn’t had to fight the snow I would say this trail is at the lower end of moderate. Well marked and not much of incline (even when we were blazing our own trails)! This is a trip for next year just later in he season. Remember, this is the Unitas and weather can change in an instant. We woke Friday morning at 7:30 to blue sky’s and within an hour we had hail, snow and sleet with 20mph winds. An hour after that it was 70deg."

11,2017-08-27,[''],Great trail we hiked from one end to the other & all our fit bits said 11.5 miles one way so be prepared for a good hike. Beautiful scenery.
12,2017-08-15,['hiking'],"I took the point to point on the trail starting from Trial Lake. I left a bike up at the Bald Mountain trailhead to get back to my car at Trial Lake. The walk was good. It was a sunday morning with very cool air. Navigation is easy as there aren't a whole lot side trails merging with this loop. 

There are sections of trail that are stubbornly rocky because of erosion but overall it's a good one. The inclines aren't crazy, however the trail does get a little steep and loose headed up the north flanks of Notch Mountain. I think I ended up with about a 10 mile day on the trail, according to the ole GPS. 

The views are spectacular and well worth getting some photos. The trail is pretty heavily used but I didn't see that many people once I passed Ibantik lake. In fact, the stretch between Wall Lake and Ibantik is the only stretch that I really saw anyone."
13,2017-07-23,['backpacking'],"Packed up the Grandkids [ages 4yr -13yr] 7 gk 5 adults [30- 64 yr]. Started at Bald mountain TH and headed to Notch Lake. Camped at the West end near the cliffs. We all went swimming and cliff jumping, even the 4 yr old did a 10 footer. Bugs not bad, intermittent rain which made the temps much better. Great place to hike and camp."

15,2017-07-02,[''],"We started at Baldy's trailhead and hiked back down to Trial Lake (two car shuffle technique). It was no joke, but both my 9 yr old and my 11 yr. old made it. Going over the notch was an intense uphill, but so very, very worth it. 

I'm a wuss with bad knees, so this is about as hard as I can do, but I loved it."
16,2016-09-12,['hiking'],"I did this hike over the weekend with a group of 12 yr old scouts. We started at the Crystal Lake TH and finished 10 miles later at Bald Mountain Pass. This route took us 5.5 hours with only a few stops for pics, snacks and a pace that all would enjoy.  Everyone did awesome and already asking to do it again!  

As a side note, I wouldn't call this route between Bald Mountain and Trial (or Crystal) Lake an ""out and back"" unless you hike from one of these THs and *return* to the same TH. Otherwise, if you start at one end and finish at the OTHER end, as indicated by this trail description, we call that a thru hike...in which case, you will need to make arrangements for a shuttle car as we had to do. That said, I also think the ""17.8 mile"" stated distance is wrong too. Whether that calculation was intended to be 1-way (from Bald to Trial) or 2-way (from Bald to Trial and then back to Bald), it's confusing and inaccurate!  Lastly, we snowmobile this area in the winter and that trail is NOT accessible in March (nor April).  The Mirror Lake Highway is typically under a LOT of snow until May (even into June) before they slowly start plowing up and over Bald Mountain Pass. If you are going to hike this trail in March, you better have a snow machine of some kind to get yourself to the trailhead and then snowshoes from that point on where you will be breaking trail the whole way in (and it is DEEP)."
17,2016-08-22,[''],"only went to the notch. started at parking for Washington lake / crystal lake . hike to wall lake and connected to notch mountain trail.
moderate trail 2.9 miles to point .
too many people but this was a Sunday in August!!
great views. had lunch at the notch (plus a little nap time) . views are wonderful looking from each side of the notch...great if your not in mood for a full 9 mile commitment to other side."
18,2016-07-24,['hiking'],"We did a loop starting from the parking lot near Trial Lake, went by Wall Lake and Hope Lake, returned from the Notch. We came back from John Lake and bypassed Clyde Lake, Watson Lake, Cliff Lake, and Crystal Lake. Pretty flat. No particular challenge. Other than the section between Clyde Lake and the Notch, the trail is clearly delineated. 

Can be quite warm in summer days during the day. Cool down quickly in the evening. Great Hike."
19,2016-07-08,['hiking'],This was our first time to hike this trail.  Great hike. When you reach Notch Lake be sure to climb up plateau that overlooks the lake. Awesome views.
20,2016-06-26,['backpacking'],"Backpacked to Notch Lake and camped.  Very nice hike, still a fair amount of snow patches and runoff making the trail muddy and running water in some spots."
21,2015-11-23,['hiking'],"This may be one of my favorite trails in Utah. You come upon so many lakes that it makes for a magical day. Near the end of the hike, we reached a campground area where we could connect to the road and walk it back to where the car was parked. (We were doing a loop)  But, we thought it looked doable to cut across the side of Bald Mountain to get back to Moosehorn Campground. What a decision. We found a little meadow on a ledge that was invisible when looking up at the mountain from camp. It had the most beautiful little meandering stream and a little (tiny) glassy shallow lake with rocks nested half in the water. It was like a fairy tale. If you go this way you have to scramble down the side of the mountain to Moosehorn Lake. But, its SO worth it."
22,2015-11-08,['hiking'],Just flat out gorgeous. Easy hike and amazing scenery.
23,2015-10-19,['camping'],"Camped at about 2.5 miles in, great trail, tons of amazing scenery. Good stuff."
24,2015-08-18,['camping'],"Nice downhill hike, in. Superb camping spots. Great for families. Beautiful lake and scenery. A little bit of an uphill back out."
25,2015-08-15,['hiking'],"Good hike, not too tough for the Scouts."
26,2015-07-18,['walking'],"We had lots of fun, super easier trail but a good little distance to make a fun few hours out of it. Water felt great, too."
27,2012-08-26,['hiking'],"Notch Mountain Trail is a nice scenic hike with so many lakes you can't keep track of them all. The view from the notch at the top is spectacular and makes the whole trip worthwhile. From the Bald Mtn trailhead to Ibantic Lake the trail slowly winds and gently slopes up and down. This part is the easiest and doesn't take much effort. Each lake is worth a look and certainly a good reason to take a break. From Ibantic Lake to the notch is almost all uphill. The elevation from the trailhead to the notch is virtually the same.
From the notch to Lily Lakes trailhead is almost all down hill. The portion from Clyde Lake to Crystal Lake is quite steep and very rocky in some spots. This, however is the more scenic part of the trail. Easy access from Trial and Washington Lake make this part more crowded as well. We did this trail in late August where the lakes with dams are much lower and have more exposed shore line then the naturally occuring lakes which provide prettier and better photographic opportunities.
This is a great overnight hike or is also do-able as a day hike. I would recommend a map unless you know the area well. The heaver use lakes have trails around them, some of which are the actual Notch Mtn Trail and some portions are not. We did not see signs at most of the lakes and directions are not posted at the junctions. The hike, however is great!"
28,2010-08-19,['hiking'],"There was a threat of thunder storm, so we decided to take this trail instead of Bald mountain. It was easy enjoyable hike."
29,2000-07-22,['backpacking'],Camped an Notch Lake and day hiked to Meadow Lake from the Bald Mountain trail.
