Also, the beauty of the wildflowers and the open meadows and the sweet creek, and then the vistas from the top of the mountain overlooking The Canyons are amazing!! I go all the way to Murdoch Peak (ski lift) and sit down to have a little bite to eat before going back down to my car. Mountain bikers and dogs are plentiful. Check days if you want to avoid them. "
1,2019-09-03,['hiking'],Down via Little Big Water.
2,2019-08-13,['hiking'],Good hike but at the end the trail becomes hard to see due to bushes but not bad at all.
3,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'over grown']","Watch for the ""bum, butt, derrière"" tree on your left while hiking up.  So funny!  (about 1.5ish miles up)

You can miss the trail easily if you are not paying attention to your All Trail's map.  At the large ""3 way trail intersection"" look for the overgrown trail off to your left.  There are some logs and sticks piled on the side...enter there and up you'll go!

Check for ticks when you get home due to all the overgrown brush.  "

5,2019-08-01,"['hiking', 'over grown']","Great hike!  Dog friendly going in and out of a stream on the way up.  Most of the hike is a gentle incline through the forest with a steep climb at the end for the summit.  We missed the fork to the summit on the way up: it’s tough to find at the top where the WCT intersects, if you see park city you’ve gone too far.  Bring pants even if on trail, the ascent is very scratchy."
6,2019-07-29,['hiking'],Started early and had the trail and summit to myself.  Tons of wildflowers.  The trail from the ridge to the summit is very overgrown.  I had long pants and was glad I did.  Great views.  
7,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'bugs']","So green this year. Beautiful flowers, and most of the trail under the shade. At the end, before climbing to the Murdock summit there is a crossroads and the trail is not well signed so we have to go up and go down by crossing the Aspen Forest. "
8,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"Great hike: good trail, birds, butterflies, and wild flowers galore. "
9,2019-07-04,['hiking'],"the hike was amazing, but where to head up towards the peak, we were unable to find. Ended up off trail for a while due to this."
10,2018-11-25,['hiking'],"Took the huskies up past the closed winter gate all the way up to the Old Red Pine Trail thus adding another 9 miles to the journey. 

The elevation gain is spread out very gradually, but yeah this is a long walk / run ...

At any rate, it's highly recommended ! Very secluded and plenty of room to think. 

Murdock Peak offers excellent views overlooking Park City, Millcreek Canyon and across the Wasatch Range."
11,2018-11-06,['hiking'],"Lovely easier trail, at least up to the steeper climb at the end.  Those noting that the trailhead is too busy are just going in the wrong season.  If you wait until the gate is closed (usually 11/1) and bike up, there is no one there at all :-)  I pondered heading up the wasatch crest trail, but it looked like the snow got deeper, so I followed the ridge from Murdock over to Millvue, then bushwhacked down the slope back to the parking lot."
12,2018-07-16,['hiking'],"The wildflowers are stunning and are every bit as pretty and as many as other locations in the Wasatch Mountains.  The difference—hardly any people because of the limited parking.  We skipped the hike to Murdock Peak, went to the overlook instead and then hiked down the Great Western Trail to connect with another leg of the trail to dog lake.   We logged 8.5 Miles.  Fantastic!!!!"
13,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"One of my favorite favorite hikes! Flowers are stunning right now! My pups also love this trail-.plenty of water along the way right now! 
FYI-loads of biting flies.remember the bug spray!"
14,2018-07-10,['hiking'],"The wildflowers are simply splendid.  Bikers are courteous for the most part but they really go fast and I consider them a hazard. I will try to schedule on odd days from now on.

This is a pretty easy hike.  A steady climb on a well maintained trail.  Nice bird activity and plenty of shade early in the morning."
15,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"This was a really pretty trail even though we only made it 1.5 miles out. The wildflowers are very pretty! It was a little confusing to figure out where to start, but we got lucky and got parking right at the trail head. The drive up was on a paved road, but it got a little tight in some areas because of how many cyclists ❤️ and other cars there were. We didn’t make it to the top so we didn’t get many scenic views, but I still loved it! The trail itself was not as busy as the surrounding areas."
16,2018-07-07,['trail running'],"Ran the trail with my pup last week and it was fantastic! Be prepared to bush-whack the last bit to the peak, the views and wild flowers are worth it. Great refuge from SLC summer heat. Will definitely do again!"
17,2018-04-21,['hiking'],"My wife and I love this trail. Not a lot of traffic, and some gorgeous wildflowers. We hike up this trail even when we’re not going to the top . . . just for the solitude!"
18,2017-08-01,['trail running'],"Busy trailhead but no one took this trail.  Not overwhelmingly steep with lots of flat sections to allow trail running up.  Last part there is no single trail, pretty much a bushwhack to the peak.  Amazing views."
19,2017-07-29,['trail running'],"The trail was great up until the last 500 vertical feet. I saw two moose and went over to a canyons ski lift, so that was really cool. Once you finally get the point of getting to the peak there is almost not trail at all. The view is great however, and not busy at all."
20,2017-07-16,['hiking'],Hiked up from the Big Water trailhead. Arrived at the saddle right at dawn for a beautiful sunrise. Then climbed Murdock Peak which had great views in every direction. Followed the ridge to Millvue Peak and then down the Lambs Canyon trail to Elbow Fork trailhead. .
21,2017-07-05,['hiking'],Great hike in the heat of summer. Can run up most of the trail. Recommend following GPS near the turn off toward the peak or you can easily miss the trail. Can add some miles by taking big water trail on the way down.
22,2017-07-04,['trail running'],"Went on an odd day and only saw a handful of people. The Murdock peak original trail turnoff shown on this map doesn't exist. You have to go to the ski area around the peak and it's a very steep hike up to the peak. I didn't bother with it, the rest of the trail was wonderful enough."
23,2017-07-01,[''],Great hike but we did have to move out of the way a lot for bicyclists on the trail.
24,2016-10-14,['hiking'],"Great trail and views from above Park City, no where on this trail will it say ""Park City overlook"". It's lower water trail to start straight in front of the parking lot then Old Red Pine road trail is what you want to follow up. As Ashley S said to go to the top it's easy to miss (we did) because the trail is not clearly marked to summit Murdock  and it is a bushwhack she gives good directions on how not to miss it."
25,2016-09-18,[''],"Alright, here are clear directions. DO NOT take GWT to Crest, unless you want a 13 mile + hike.  I mean the views are epic, you can also get to a ski lift at the top of the canyons this way.  If you want to go Directly to Murdock do this:
1. Take the Old Red Pine Road trail (directly across from the bathrooms at the parking lot)
2. Turn left when the trail dead ends just after a wooden bridge.  You'll have hiked quite a ways, you'll see a creek and a fairly flat trail in a meadow. 3. Hike for about a mile.  You'll come to the crest trail, just before your current trail and crest merge is a sign ""No bikes on odd days"".  Look to your left in the grove of Aspens, that's the trail up to Murdock Peak.  Murdock peak has a white board on it attached to a box, that's where you're going.  There will be much bush whacking to get to the top.  Bring some long pants unless you wanna get banged up."
26,2016-08-30,['trail running'],"Great scenery - the pup loved that there was water following a good amount of the trail. We took Little Water trail up to the Great Western Trail, which met up with Old Red Pine Rd Trail. Made it a loop and just took ORPRT back down. Little Water Trail is much shadier and I would call it the scenic route up to Wasatch Crest Trail. Fall colors are just developing now. Beautiful "
27,2016-08-20,['trail running'],Great for running!  The elevation gain is gradual for most of the trail. Very beautiful but almost the peak felt more like a small hill n
28,2016-07-29,['hiking'],We went up the top of millcreek to get away from the heat in the valley. It was about 20 degrees cooler and beautiful. Only bad thing about this hike was the bugs were swarming. A lot of hornets to. Flowers were pretty and mostly in the shade.
29,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"7.23.2016  |  8:45am-12:30pm Round Trip
Must Have: Sunscreen, hiking shoes.

This is a really beautiful trail that starts at the Red Pine Road Trailhead. It begins with steep switchbacks, turns to a casual incline, then gets steeper again toward the Park City Overlook. You pass under trees, over streams and through meadows that are stunning when in bloom.

The path isn't exceptionally shaded so wear sunscreen, especially for the bare peak. You can also get away without hiking shoes until ascending the peak which is rockier and steeper than it looks (and the steepest part of this entire trail).  In Winter it's a double black diamond.

There's an obvious sign pointing to the peak, but the trail isn't obvious so I turned back halfway up as that's where the trail really lost itself (and didn't want to rock scramble in mid-day heat).

Fair amount of trail runners, hikers and bikes but if you hit it at the right time it's very peaceful."
30,2016-07-24,['hiking'],"Really beautiful especially when flowers are in full bloom and the Park City Overlook is lovely.

This is a great starting trail to branch to other trails at the top.The beginning is the steepest part and I like that the remaining length is a moderate incline so it doesn't hurt your knees coming down.

Fair amount of trail runners, hikers and bikes but if you hit it at the right time it's very peaceful."
31,2015-08-31,['trail running'],"This was a great trail for a run! It's mostly shaded and passes through several cottonwood and evergreen forests and several meadows on its way to stunning views of Solitude and PC. I learned that there are two ways that you can go about doing this one. Either way you start at the Little Water trailhead in Millcreek Canyon. If you want to do the 6.6 mile option, shortly past the trailhead you take a left on Old Red Pine Road and follow that until it dead-ends on the Great Western Trial. Then, follow that to the Wasatch Crest Trail. If you want to take the longer route (which I accidentally did) skip the Old Red Pine Road shortcut and take Little Water straight to the Great Western Trail. Then, follow that towards Lake Desolation until you hook up with the Wasatch Crest Trail. This option is longer, and in total was a little over 9 miles."
32,2015-08-30,[''],The most difficult part was the ascent in the heat after just beginning. After that it was easy going. Go on a day when bikes aren't allowed.
33,2015-08-04,['hiking'],Hiked this trail as an extension of the Wasatch Crest Trail. The trail is very easy to follow and climbs from the trailhead to a ridge where you can see Park City and the Canyons/Park City ski resort. Because much of the trail is near the bottom of the canyon and trees there are limited views of the upper Millcreek basin.until you get to the top of the trail. Because I hike early in the morning the crowds were moderate on the Saturday that I hiked
34,2015-07-27,['hiking'],Truly the road less traveled. Magnificent light hike through dense foliage astounding fragrance alongside a babbling brook and multitudes of springs. Low people traffic and high wildlife encounters.
35,2015-07-12,['hiking'],"This is a great trail. 

It is under-traveled since most parked at the end of Millcreek Canyon Road go to Dog Lake via Big Water or Little Water trails. The elevation gain is modest, especially after two miles from the trail head. It is suitable for family with kids (8 yr old and above). 

It is recently updated, which had made the trail much more walkable. 

Here is a tip. At around 0.71 mile from the trail head, you would see a split. You can either go up (to the left) via the relatively new trail, or go straight to the old trail (right). The two trails will merge at around 2.24 miles or 2.45 miles, depending on which route you pick. If you pick the old trail, you will walk on the south side of Mill Creek and pass over the creek several times. So be careful when there is rain or heavy run off. There are many barriers on the old trail."
36,2013-07-28,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful! You hike up Mill Creek Canyon (SLC), up and over the mountain, and end up at the top of the ski lift in Park City! The climb to Murdock Peak is the most difficult part if you choose not to climb it at least go to the right where the ski lift drops off for some beautiful views of Park City. Great meadows, wildflowers and I ran into some pheasant going up Murdock Peak. "
