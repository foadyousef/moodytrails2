0,2019-08-26,['hiking'],"this is a beautiful trail. temperatures were in the high 50's to low 60's. nice breeze and amazing wildflowers. it's a fairly easy hike, but most is up hill.
once you have reached the lake, it's a wonderful to sit and relax. bring a lunch and watch the wildlife. Enjoyed watching a hawk fly over the lake. Not too many other hikers at 10 am.

1,2019-07-31,['hiking'],Awesome trail. Remember that you have to pay a fee for parking (i forgot)
2,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Stopped at the peak, made it in under an hour. I’ve hiked to the lake from the other side and backpacked in there. We started about 7:30pm trying to beat the sun and we were at the top at the golden hour, for the sunset. Many mosquitos pretty much the entire way. No large wild life spotting. Gorgeous views from the top!!!"
3,2019-07-22,['hiking'],Awesome trail but a little optimistic to call this EASY. 
4,2019-07-22,['hiking'],This is a beautiful hike. It took us several hours. The first mile up was a little grindy for us flat landers. After that it was really fun with amazing views. Enjoy!
5,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'snow']","For someone who doesn’t hike very much, this one was pretty easy. Took us about 3 hours roundtrip and the lake was beautiful! We went really early (7 AM) to avoid the crowds and left just as soon as it started to get too crowded. Be warned that there are a ton of mosquitos. Luckily there was still some snow and being that early, it was cool enough for us to wear jackets to avoid getting bitten. "
6,2019-07-17,['hiking'],I would only write 4 stars because I think it’s more fun to do from the Brighton side because you can hit multiple lakes and you don’t have to go down and back up. Still an amazing hike! Would reccomend. 
7,2019-07-07,"['hiking', 'closed']",The trail head does not Open until July 16th
8,2019-07-07,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'snow']",Grab tracking poles and proper shoes: a lot of snow. Also it's tricky to find the trail under the snow so make sure you have an offline map downloaded on your phone. The lake is frozen right now btw
9,2019-03-21,['hiking'],breathtaking views!
10,2018-10-07,[''],Very challenging hike. But worth the views!
11,2018-09-28,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful hike. a little strenuous but worth the reward! I'll do this hike again for sure! #beaUTAHful
12,2018-09-18,[''],"Great hike, moderate hike with spectacular views the entire way. Really beautiful view of the lake. Next time we will bring 2 cars and hike on Thru to Brighton."
13,2018-09-17,[''],"Great hike, small amount of challenge and long enough that you feel accomplished at the end, but short enough that you can fit it into your day very easily.
Views are gorgeous, and it's high up enough that you feel removed from it all."
14,2018-09-16,[''],Hiked to all the sister lakes. Great hike and very beautiful.
15,2018-09-02,[''],Great hike! I did this one a few weeks ago and it was super easy and had beautiful views. We got there shortly after sunrise. Will definitely do this again and even take my kids with me next time.
16,2018-07-31,['hiking'],Beautiful wild flowers! And saw a badger right off the trail. 
17,2018-07-31,[''],There are a lot of badgers
18,2018-07-14,[''],"$6 to park or $10 per person to ride the lift to the trailhead. I was not thrilled with the fees, but the ride up the lift was beautiful. The hike itself was easy and the wildflowers are in full bloom. It’s a blanket  of colors right now! This is the perfect time to go as it’s so much cooler at the top than in the valley, and the views are magical."
19,2018-07-06,['hiking'],"Hiked this last night. Didn't love that they're charging $6 to get up to the end of the road, but the hike was great. First time for me on this trail. Not too steep, didn't take us too long to get up to the pass (somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes I think). The mosquitos were fairly annoying. Might be better in the morning or day time."
20,2018-07-06,['hiking'],"I would rate this trail as moderate. I hiked it 10 or 12 times last year and love it! The steps are rarely very treacherous, but I'd give a moderate rating because of (great) heart pumping if you're not stopping a lot, especially for my less-frequently hiking friends. The views are terrific, and this is my preferred, quieter alternative trail for wildflower season when the Albion Basin gets crazy busy. After the trail opens into a large meadow-like area, keep going for the final steep push. It's worth it! The only reason I rate 4 stars is because of construction noises happening Alta this year and last."
21,2018-07-05,['hiking'],Absolutely Beautiful!
22,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"Perfect way to spend the holiday. The road is open, the flowers are blooming, he chipmunks are... chipping? Munking? Anyway, wonderful hike!"
23,2018-06-26,[''],I went up to do this hike last week and the road to Albion basin was closed.  I wish someone would have mentioned that from the Alta side this hike until around July first is 4.4 miles longer for you have to hike the road 2.2 miles to the trailhead.  I ended up a few days later heading up from Brighton side and this hike is stunning.  Here is a 360 degree visual of the hike from the BRIGHTON side.  https://shaunasadventures.blogspot.com/2018/06/360-adventure-hike-to-lake-mary-martha.html?m=1
24,2018-06-23,[''],"The upper road to the trailhead will be closed until July 1 (at which time they will start charging for parking up there), so we started at Alta and took the Albion Meadows trail up to the trailhead. Wildflowers are just starting to bloom and the upper meadow just before the final rise to the crest is covered in yellow flowers. Elevation gains from the bottom were brutal, but worth it. From Alta it was 6 miles round trip."
25,2018-06-22,[''],Nice trail but summer road is closed due to construction so had to start from Alta base
26,2018-06-14,['hiking'],"We went hiking on this trail on Sunday (June 10), and most of the trail was clear except for a few snow patches. Still, it was walkable. Wildflowers are barely starting to grow. A nice and easy trail besides navigating a few tricky snow/muddy spots."
27,2018-05-31,['hiking'],Has anyone been up here recently? Is there still a lot of snow?
28,2018-05-24,[''],Beautiful and short hike
29,2017-10-15,['hiking'],The trail had 4-6 inches of new snow early this morning and had the trail to ourselves except for birds and deer.
30,2017-09-03,['hiking'],"Beautiful moderate hike. Bring lots of water. Start early if you want explore at the peak. Alos, I parked at the trailhead and was lucky-one spot left. It fills up fast."
31,2017-09-03,['backpacking'],Backpacked up here last night and spent the night. By the time I arrived it was dark and pretty rocky on the way down to Lake Catherine. The trail was well maintained and really nice and if you keep hiking past Lake Catherine you get amazing views of Lake Mary and Lake Martha.
32,2017-09-02,['backpacking'],We got to the trailhead at 4pm so we were lucky to get parking.  The trail itself is beautiful and well-maintained as well as uncrowded.  There is a pungent plant growing halfway thru.  We set up camp on the southwest corner of the lake along with several other groups.  The lake is like a bowl so it was an amphitheater when it came to noise but everyone seemed to notice that and were respectful although the young kids had a hard time remembering ;) Only saw 2 mosquitoes.  I really wanted to summit Sunrise Peak but my hubby said no so I'll have to come back another time just as a hiker.
33,2017-09-02,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes this year!
34,2017-08-31,[''],Gorgeous!
35,2017-08-25,['hiking'],This is such a beautiful hike!! Saw lots of deer and a moose. We went pretty early and didn't come across anyone until we were almost done. So go early if you want to avoid people. (we started the hike at 6:30am on a friday)
36,2017-08-18,[''],Great hike! Flowers are still beautiful. Saw lots and lots of deer on this early morning hike and a moose as we drove out!
37,2017-08-13,[''],"I wouldn't rate this as ""easy""... Wildflowers are still on fire right now!"
38,2017-07-30,['hiking'],Wildflowers are in full bloom!
39,2017-07-28,[''],A beautiful hike with pine trees framing all the wild flowers and mountain views.
40,2017-07-16,[''],"liked this hike, little difficult going to the lake from the pass, but is doable"
41,2017-06-29,[''],One of my favorite hikes.
42,2017-06-24,[''],There's still quite a bit of snow. The road to the trailhead is closed another couple of weeks. We did get very close to Lake Catherine but the snow stopped us sadly. We plan to return in a few weeks where it will be easier to get too. I'd give it a higher rating if we'd have been able to see it. Still ended up with a decent hike.
43,2017-05-18,[''],I felt like singing sound of music the whole time. And the wildflowers. ❤️ this hike has my heart.
44,2016-10-10,['hiking'],"Good trail for beginners. Great views of surrounding area. Went beyond Lake Catherine to Sunset peak. Hiked through the snow and reached around 10,500. Nice trip back to car."
45,2016-09-03,[''],Nice hike
46,2016-08-27,['hiking'],Beautiful hike!
47,2016-08-21,[''],"Very nice hike, and a bunch of friendly fellow hikers along the way! A little rough to finish for my four year old boy, but he was a trooper, and finally quit about 3/4 of the way down. All in all, a great afternoon."
48,2016-08-18,['hiking'],"This was a great moderate hike for the whole family! While we had to take a few stops along the way, our four year old completed this trail all the way to the lake and back (most of the way). The weather was perfect and we were even treated with the surprise of a massive bull moose."
49,2016-07-31,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful hike with wildflowers everywhere! Took my 10 yr old niece and we both enjoyed it. Once at the summit we hiked down to Lake Catherine, saw two moose, one female, one male. Took the small trail around the pretty, yet small lake, had fun skipping rocks. Took us about an hour & 1/2 to get there (taking our time) and 40 minutes back."
50,2016-07-26,[''],"would have been a 5, but i like a less trafficked trail.  wildflowers were beautiful.  hiked with a group of kids (3-6 yo) and they managed to make it down to the lake. super fun day,  beautiful little Lake.  would have been a 5 with fewer people and maybe the ability to go for a swim...  (watershed)"
51,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"My wife and I did the trail with our 8 and 10 year old and my mother in law. We hiked from the lower parking lot at Alta's base up through the lower meadows and joined the trail at the upper parking lot. The ~3 mile hike up took us just over an hour and a half with lots of stops. 

The trail was fairly busy compared to previous times we have hiked this trail due to a holiday weekend."
52,2016-07-25,[''],"Took the Albion Meadows Trail to the trailhead, it probably added a couple of miles. The map is a little off - the map shows a trail that has been closed for restoration. During the first half mile, there is a left turn that the map does not show. There are signs at Alta, at least small ones, follow those."
53,2016-07-24,['hiking'],Easy trail up the Alta side! Wildflower season is upon us!
54,2016-07-23,['hiking'],Not difficult but some steep parts. Wildflowers were amazing as were the views!
55,2016-07-10,['hiking'],Nice hike- good for kids.
56,2016-07-10,[''],nice hike. went to sunset peak.
57,2016-06-28,['hiking'],Trail completely dry with no snow. Flowers just starting to bloom lower down the trail near Albion Basin. Not many flowers higher up the trail. Road still closed to the trail head and will open on July 1.
58,2016-06-19,[''],Most of the trail was still covered with snow. The view was worth the hike.
59,2016-06-05,[''],"the access road was closed so you can't even get to the hike trail head yet! So, I guess it actually doesn't open until the end of June?"
60,2015-12-08,['hiking'],Hike to Lake Catherine a dozen times but this is the first time from the Alta side. Still enjoy the area
61,2015-10-12,['hiking'],Well maintained and easy. Completed this on the way to Sunset Peak. You can smash this one out in about an hour. Great views from Catherine Pass.
62,2015-09-19,['hiking'],Fantastic hike
63,2015-08-25,['fishing'],It was a Great Hike.  The rain and light wind cleared the sky of smoke.  The Brook Trout in the lake average 10 inches and full of color.  A Great day to be in the mountains.
64,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful Alpine Lake with small fish surrounded by 10,500 foot peaks."
65,2015-07-14,[''],Beautiful hike with flowers and rock formations. Some parts were steep. Best part was climbing up to see all three lakes.
66,2015-07-10,['hiking'],Beautiful!
67,2014-10-09,['hiking'],Fantastic Trail. Mostly low angles with some steeper sections. Views in the fall with the snow are incredible and the side trail from the saddle up to Sunset Peak is really cool. Up towards the upper saddle there is evidence of the motorcycles coming up Dry Fork from American Fork.
68,2013-08-20,['hiking'],"This was a nice short hike to a decent view. There are a lot of people on this trail so if you're looking for a quiet nature walk, select a different hike. This is the third lake at the Brighton ski resort. I was told that if you go up higher, you get a view of all three lakes : Mary, Martha and Catherine. We didn't make it up there fearing it would rain. "
69,2013-08-09,['hiking'],"Short evening hike and a good workout. There are three small lakes on this trail including Lake Catherine. Would be a great hike for families, but watch out for moose! Also, this hike connects Brighton in Big Cottonwood Canyon to Alta in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Make a day of it and tour both areas!"
70,2013-07-30,['hiking'],Pretty easy trail and beautiful views of the wildflowers if you go at the right time of year. It's nice to see how pretty alta is when it's not covered with the best snow in the world. 
71,2013-07-06,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful trail that starts from the parking lot near a ski lift on the Albion Basin Rd. (dirt road) above Alta). There is a shuttle that picks you up just beneath the dirt road and takes you up to the parking lot where the hike starts or to Albion Basin Campground, where the Secret Lake hike starts. 

Catherine's Pass is full of beautiful wild flowers and nice trees. Some spots with no or little shade and some with more shade. The elevation is very high, approximately, 9,000-10,000 ft., so the air is thin up here. The trail runs east and ends up above Lake Catherine, which is beautiful This is a stopping point for most, but you can continue on a little SE and summit Sunset Peak, which is fairly easy and totally worth it. From here, you see Lake Catherine, Lake Mary, and Lake Martha all lined up. As well, you will see the Unitas, Heber, and the Wasatch  Mountains.

When you're ready, hike back down to your shuttle stop and get a ride back to your car."
