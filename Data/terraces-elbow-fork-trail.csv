0,2019-09-07,"['hiking', 'over grown']",Love this trail so much! No bikes so dogs can always be off leash. There is a good incline on both ends of the trail but the middle is fairly level. Lots of trees and beautiful views. It was a little overgrown in some spots but completely passable.
1,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']","Very narrow trail, overgrown in a lot of spots with a few trees blocking the trail. My pup had some trouble getting over the fallen trees and I worried about his footing on the narrow switchbacks. About 60% shaded which makes it nice on a hot day."
2,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Beautiful views. Challenging but well shaded so it was perfect. Peaceful and plenty of views to stop and take in. Lots of bugs. Lots of them. But worth it. 
3,2019-07-09,['hiking'],"Probably hiked about 2 miles in from the Terraces trail head.  Very nice trail, mostly shaded.  Nice over.look. 
 Dogs allowed off leash only on odd numbered days.  Water much of the way."

5,2019-06-30,[''],Great hike! Stick to liberty park Kristen!
6,2019-06-21,['hiking'],"Not my favorite trail and I only made it half way!  It runs along a very steep slope, so the trail is both very narrow and tilted. Falling off the trail and down that slope would not be good. If you don’t mind the constant threat of walking along such a slope at an angle, then you’ll find a nice dirt trail with few rocks and lots of shade. "
7,2019-06-05,[''],"I was expecting this to be similar to the pipeline trail since it is mostly parallel to the road.  It is not - this is much steeper which gives a few good views of both milcreek canyon and the mountains in big cottonwood canyon.  Several fallen trees across the path and some areas with overgrown bushes that you have to push through.  Mostly shaded, should be a good hike on a hot day."
8,2019-06-05,['hiking'],"Snow all gone, several downed trees, great views and nice shade for dogs"
9,2019-05-31,['hiking'],Nice and shady with beautiful green leaves growing in. Some spots were muddy but that’s to be expected given our recent weather.
10,2019-01-13,['skiing'],Toured up this morning. Great views once you get through the switch backs but steep and narrow skiing the trail back down. Be much better in the summer so you don’t have to hike the road up
11,2018-11-19,['hiking'],"We started the hike from Terrace picnic area and ended near the Pipeline/Mt Aire trailhead. The gate to the road leading up to picnic area was closed due to snow so we had to hike extra half mile to get to the trailhead. Trail was fully covered in fresh powdered snow and we were the only ones hiking throughout. It was snowing almost the entire time we hiked. There aren’t major views but it opens up few times - the snowfall made the visibility of the valley low but made the scenery really pretty. Be careful, there were multiple trees uprooted on the trail towards last mile. It’s not 4.4 miles out and back as mentioned, I recorded 3 miles point to point."
12,2018-08-23,[''],Good hike but did have over growth in several spots. Not to difficult.
13,2018-07-18,[''],"Fun hike, but it is over grown. There is a patch where youre going through overgrown branches for almost a quarter mile. There are some roots under the bratches so it get a little hard to see where you are walking. The pup had a great time though, of course. Not very busy for a Monday night. I think we saw maybe 3 other dogs."
14,2018-07-11,[''],Overgrown and not much for overviews... there's better out there.
15,2018-07-08,[''],What a great trail. We did this with our four kids (one baby in the backpack) and although there were some parts that were quite steep it was doable. beautiful views toward the top. We didn’t make it the entire 2.2 miles to the turn around so we cannot report on the upper trail
16,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"Butterflies in clouds all over the trail. Shaded trail in many spots. Rigorous trail in good condition. Stream running next to the trail for most of it. 
Parking can be tight. Pack a picnic for the trailhead. Road leading is narfow but short with pull offs. 
Excellent trail."
17,2018-06-18,[''],No reward at the end.  Scary disliked strongly the bush. We didn’t like the bush.  Hit me up if you actually like hiking in the bush. We want to know why.
18,2018-06-11,['hiking'],"Loooved this hike. Took my dog this last weekend and the scenery is so diverse I was in love. Great overlooks, tons of pretty wild flowers and thick forest in some areas made me want to do this hike again and again. Although probably a bit long for some people it was perfect for my dog and I on a weekend with nothing to do."
19,2018-06-11,[''],So pretty!
20,2018-06-09,['hiking'],Gorgeous hike
21,2018-05-06,['hiking'],
22,2017-09-09,['hiking'],"DIRECTIONS:
While the trail on the map is correct, if you use the directions it will not take you to the correct area! It has you stop at a small parking lot on the south side of the road and is super confusing because there is a green sign that says Terraces and Trailhead. This is not the correct spot. You need to continue up the canyon a couple more miles, you're looking for the Elbow Forks Sign which will come right at the end of the road going east, then it starts to head south. There is a rest room with a small dirt area. This is not where the trail starts, this is where the Mount Aire Trail starts. If you go across the road and south a little there is a smaller dirt area and a small wood sign that says Elbow Forks Trail. It took us forever to find and asking several people and consulting the posted maps. 

Another thing you should know about this trail is that it starts on one road of the canyon, and ends back at the road further down. You reach the lookout area, the best spot for views, at a little more than 2 miles in. From here it will continue on and then start to head back down. So if you were to go out and back it would be more than 8 miles. While the views from this lookout were beautiful the rest of the trail was rough. Roots, overgrown quite a bit so that you only have a very small narrow path the last bit and then it goes pretty steeply down on dirt. 

The leaves were already starting to change on some of the bushes, which was pretty but overall I don't think I would do this trail again. Really more of a Hard trail, than a Moderate one."
23,2017-08-31,['hiking'],"This is a nice hike.  It has a great view and half the traffic of the Desolation Trail (that goes to the SL Overlook).  We went in the mid morning and had shade much of the way, which was great. On the weekend it can be challenging to find a place to park near Elbow Fork, but there is usually plenty of parking off of the Millcreek Rd. end."
24,2017-08-07,['hiking'],Little on the steep side as you get in but still a wonderful hike. 2.3 miles to the lookout. Great dog trail with shade and stream.
25,2017-08-06,['hiking'],
26,2017-07-22,[''],very steep Trail beautiful lots of shade a little over grown in some areas but well worth the hike
27,2017-07-15,[''],Great hike and you can take your dog!
28,2017-07-10,['hiking'],"Good amount of shade, steep at some parts, cool views. No streams for dogs to drink water at. Lots of great wild flowers blooming right now!"
29,2017-07-07,[''],Went on July 4th. The wildflowers were a highlight!
30,2017-07-01,[''],I loved that this hike offered lots of shade in super lush forest areas. Some of the trail is overgrown with bushes though.
31,2017-06-19,[''],Very scenic hike. Lot's of greenery and flowers. Several pretty views of the mountains and valley farther westbound.
32,2017-06-14,['hiking'],"Definitely a moderate hike.  This is not easy past the first 1/4 mile. It is really beautiful and secluded.  Trail gets super dense near the top and is pretty overgrown.  We hiked up quite far and never reached an actual overlook or end point.  That being said, I really  enjoyed.  It is much less traveled than many of the other trails in millcreek canyon."
33,2017-06-12,[''],"Easier to moderate hike. Lots of trees and a pretty view of some other mountains nearby. Not a hike with a reward at the end like many others. Rather, this one is more enjoying being in the trees and the canyon. Great after work hike."
34,2017-06-02,['hiking'],"Gorgeous!❤️ people are saying this trail is slightly difficult, and yes it gets steep but don't let that deter you. It's a gorgeous and manageable trail. It is super lush too with the dense greenery.

Edit: this also says it's an Out and Back trail, but its point to point."
35,2017-05-28,['hiking'],"Nice trail, gets steep and a little sketchy with some rocks and trees that fell over the trail. Beautiful views and quiet. Definitely moderate, not super easy (that's probably also because I from a place below sea level ;-))"
36,2017-05-15,['hiking'],Have done this both directions. Prefer going up the road and down the trail. Nice ups and downs. Kids did well.
37,2017-04-23,['hiking'],"This was actually steeper than I expected. Passed 4 dudes who were struggling, so it's not an easy hike. Moderate is accurate. Had to walk the road in 1/4 of a mile because the gate is still closed. I also had to turn back at about 1.6-ish miles because of snow. I tried to traverse the snow, but I didn't have spikes and I didn't see an end to it. Figured it was unsafe to continue. Trail ran back down to the bottom. I like it up there. It was very peaceful."
38,2017-02-12,[''],Didn't know you had to pay
39,2016-11-15,['hiking'],"With the gate closed, we decided to loop the trail heading directly on the road towards Terrace Fork- was well worth it- the loop up and back to the parking was about 4miles- it's one of my favorite hikes so far, up at 7000ft- so tranquil and the dogs loved it!"
40,2016-09-12,['hiking'],"I hiked this trail a week ago.  Nice shade and forest views.  Not an easy hike,definitely moderate."
41,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Nice little trail through varied, pretty terrain.  Don't be expecting an easy trail though, it isn't hard but it does climb reasonably steeply through the 1st half (whichever direction you're going."
42,2016-09-03,['hiking'],"Really nice. I didn't make it all the way due to blisters but it is well maintained, gets a little overgrown in a few places but nothing too bad. Incline on the way up is moderate but not too bad. If you go before 8am you will have to park on mill creek canyon rd and walk 1/4 mile up to the picnic area."
43,2016-08-08,['hiking'],I love this trail for running on. The overgrown vegetation makes the trail more thrilling. And the incline and decline is worth the view.
44,2016-07-07,[''],"Not bad, but a bit into the hike, the vegetation gets overgrown with thorny plants. Its a moderate incline at first, then its level for a bit, then the incline again. There are some beautiful scenes straight down the mountain canyon and over the city which were great! Its a narrow path, so keep that in mind if you want to take your pups with ya. Have fun!"
45,2016-06-26,['hiking'],"Made it about 2 miles up. Until we got to a super heavy vegetation and we turned back. I'm new to hiking and this was a great work out. Moderate hike for newbies. It was shaded for a good portion of the hike. Dog friendly, just check which days they can be off leash or not. Have fun!"
46,2016-06-26,[''],I have small kids so I'm always looking for hikes they can take. I would definitely do this again but wouldn't take the little ones. They made it through and its beautiful but gets sketchy in spots.
47,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"Just beautiful!  I did this hike yesterday with my dog.  It was perfect for going on in the hot weather because it is shaded almost the entire way.  It is fairly steep, but you go through such pretty forest.  Bring your bug spray- mosquitoes were prevalent.  I would definitely recommend this nature hike."
48,2016-06-09,[''],"I enjoyed this hike a lot. Really pretty, some great views"
49,2016-06-07,['hiking'],Such a beautiful hike. these pics to it no justice.  have bug spray for the flies
50,2016-06-06,['hiking'],"Whoa, this is a beautiful, but tough hike. Lots of bugs, too. Steel your kids ahead of time for a tough trek. That being said, the scenery is gorgeous and the picnic areas at the trailhead have plenty of shade.

I'd do Terraces again, but next  time I'll bring my dog and not my kids. Just sayin'..."
51,2015-11-09,['hiking'],"Tough from the get go. A lot of walking at a sideways angle. Levels out a bit at the top, but we did not complete it. After October 31st you have to walk up the 1/4 mile to the trailhead since the gate is closed. Will have to do it from the other end after July 1st once the road is open again, would be nice and shaded."
52,2015-07-10,['trail running'],"Run the loop several times already. If tired or short on time, I would come back via the paved road making it a 5- mile run. 

If not tired or short on time, I would run the pipeline trail, doing a full 6 mile loop. The trail is very well shaded and it is on the north side of the hill. So it is good for hot days. Even though the forest service is working hard to maintain the trail, there are some overgrown areas and surface runoffs on the trail. Very runnable in most places.

I would avoid mid to late summer due to excessive vegetation."
53,2015-06-06,[''],"Loved this trail. Very green. Lots of climb, but with a good balance of flat stretches."
54,2014-12-07,[''],Pretty steep with some icy spots. Watch out for moose. We didn't see another person the whole hike. Mostly through pine forest and some birch near the top.
55,2014-09-22,['hiking'],"Hiked half of it Last Saturday (9/20/14).  Leaves are changing,  beautiful;  sorry no pictures
Busy day on the trail,  but not bad"
56,2014-06-17,['hiking'],"I liked this trail a lot. It wasn't very crowded at all and was super beautiful. It gets pretty steep at times but definitely has lots of recovery/flat areas as well. The only thing is, as you get close to the top the trail gets really narrow between bushes and wild-flowers. 

I ran out of time and wasn't able to finish, what is at the top of the trail? Does it take you back down the other side or do you have to turn around?"
57,2014-06-17,['hiking'],My new favorite hike. Trailhead starts at the Terraces picnic area. Beautiful trail. Trails are narrow though.
58,2014-05-28,[''],Incredibly green ground cover among pines. Very picturesque
59,2014-05-28,['hiking'],This is nice hike.  Not too difficult.  There are a few steep spots but overall a fairly easy hike.  This was my second hike this year and a good one to get the legs ready for hiking season.  Only saw 3 people out so not very crowded.  The picnic areas are awesome so will be back to have lunch after I hike.
60,2014-05-23,['hiking'],Hiked the entire trail up the canyon and returned in the pipeline trail for a great roundtrip
61,2013-12-01,['hiking'],Pretty steep to begin with. Had to hike from the parking lot below because it was closed for the winter. With about half a mile left before the end of the hike we came across a moose on the trail and had to turn around
62,2012-08-01,['hiking'],Steep & brushy from Elbow Fork to Terraces. Watch out for poison oak. 
63,2012-04-11,['hiking'],"NOT near Park City. Wonderful trail up north slopes in a small canyon on the south side of Millcreek. Flowing stream, wildflowers, wild life, etc.  "
