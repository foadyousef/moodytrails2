1,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"I’d give 3.5 stars. This trail meets up with a road a couple times that leads up to the lake/reservoir. I didn’t realize that until I started so I thought I was going to be more secluded. You also intersect with a second parking lot so if you wanted to shorten the hike a little you could. If knowing that you can get to your destination by car messes with your hiking frame-of-mind, then this isn’t the trail for you. It was still a nice hike though with a mix of sun and shade. I agree with other comments that it’s easy to lose the trail, so keep your phone close. As you get toward the top there is a stream that runs along and over the trail which is nice for dogs to cool off at. I didn’t see any hikers on my way up or down but it does seem like a popular trail for Equestrians because there was a lot of horse poop on the trail (but no dead horse as a previous comment stated). The lake is cool, I went swimming in it. There is some trash and fishing lines alongside the lake/reservoir. "
2,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","A bit hard to find the trailhead, look for the 010 post. Several crossing trails in the lower half, could be easy to get on the wrong trail. Be sure to check your map now and again. Some parts were loose dirt and rocks. Many crossing trails. As you approach Silver Flat Lake the creek coming from the lake *is* the trail for 100 yards or so. Hard or impossible to not get your feet wet. Several good views of the surrounding mountains. Lots of forest and trees for shade."
3,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"Great hike, totally worth the hike up to the lake for the pups to play in! Caution: once you reach the Horse Transfer trail head there is a dead horse off to the left of the trail. Super creepy!"
4,2019-06-09,"['mountain biking', 'rocky']",Fun trail but lots of downed aspen crossing the trail. Also seemed to be a lot of unnecessary rocks on the trail that if removed would make this a really fun mix of flowing downhill and some mild technical rocky areas. My boys and I are planning on going back up to clear the trail where we can. 
5,2019-04-27,"['hiking', 'snow']",Lake was mostly frozen. Lots of packed snow as you get higher.
6,2019-03-31,['snow'],"Super snowy, but fun! We ended up coming back on the road after an exhausting trek up through deep, clean snow. Definitely take the app and check heading often!"
7,2019-03-16,"['hiking', 'snow']","Completed this hike, which was beautiful! The first part of the trail was a bit snowy. Couldn't find the trail exactly. So we hiked up the road and started at the turn around area. It had signs for a horse trail. Very easy to follow until this small ridge. We lost the trail and had to scramble down the other side where we saw tons of steady footprints (wouldn't recommend this). To avoid that, I'd go farther up the road and cut over right on one of the other trails available, then meet up with the designated trails. It's pretty easy to see. There is a mix of snowmobile and people tracks. Either will get you to the lake. Watch out for snowmobiles if you're on the roads or hear them nearby. We didn't have any problems, but were also looking out. Amazing views at the end with everything snow covered. We left about 8:30AM for the hike and were back before noon. We spent a decent amount of time just hanging out at the end, as well. Also, we did this hike with hiking boots, Yak Trax, and hiking poles. Could have done it without the Yak Trax, but would have been harder."
8,2018-12-16,['snowshoeing'],Good snow all the way up. Lots of traffic today!
9,2018-08-06,['hiking'],"Not a bad hike. About 1.75 miles up from the main trailhead. Took me roughly 30 min to the lake with a mixture of trail running and hiking. I would give this hike a 4* if it weren’t for the road access. I would rather hike to a lake that has only one way to it...foot. Also, the total ascent was only 886 from the trailhead. Total time 1:03. Oh and there was a dead horse on the trail."
10,2018-07-07,[''],This is a beautiful hike. The wild flowers were starting to bloom (June 27) and the lake was gorgeous. A good mid-range hike.

12,2017-09-09,['hiking'],Shocked by the 4.5 stars. Least favorite hike of the summer. The trail has been badly worn from horses and is extremely loose and rocky. Tons of exposure the whole way. Disappointed in the lake because water level is way down. I strongly recommend just driving to the Silver Lake TH and hiking to Silver Lake.
13,2017-08-19,['camping'],We just backpacked and tent camped two separate nights in the last week here with our dog and 4 year old son. It is a fairly easy hike and camping by the lake up top was amazing!!!!
14,2017-08-09,['hiking'],Beautiful and fun for kids!
15,2017-07-25,[''],Always a gorgeous hike!
16,2017-06-29,['hiking'],Amazing view. Worth it!
17,2017-06-05,['hiking'],"Just went up 6/3/17 with the family and the views where perfect, clear warm day. The last half mile still had snow on the trail so we hiked in the creek or snow melt run off . 
Silver lake is still frozen over so didn't get any fishing in."
18,2017-04-23,['hiking'],Best way to enjoy this area is to make the hike in spring. Once the road opens up the hordes move in and it's a total madhouse. This is a gorgeous area and a nice moderate hike.
19,2016-10-30,['snowshoeing'],Good snowshoeing trail
20,2016-09-21,['hiking'],"This was a great hike and a good workout! Consistent climb all the way to the top, a bit rocky with a little creek along the trail. Great scenery of the fall colors on the trees. Silver Lake is undergoing some construction as well as Tibble Fork."
21,2016-09-04,['hiking'],"If you are a human that enjoys trudging through horse manure, you may enjoy this one. I personally believe this trail should be renamed to ""Horse Shit Highway"". Seriously good views to be had, but just drive up to the silver lake trailhead instead."
22,2016-09-04,['hiking'],"Beautiful views, we went around 3pm and comeback around 6.30pm with 2 kids 12 and 9; The clouds trick us. So we comeback quickly and when we arrived at the gate was sunny again.  Next time we will go early to expend more time at the lake."
23,2016-08-15,[''],Loved everything about this trail!
24,2016-08-10,['hiking'],"This was a fun hike! It was definitely rocky, and was a steady incline. I would say young kids and people with knee or ankle problems might have a harder time! The lake was beautiful, but freezing! My 8 yr old did great.. It took us about 3 hours total with all the stops along the way, and playing in the lake.."
25,2016-06-22,['hiking'],Loved this hike!! Took my 7 yr. old and 11 month old and they both had a great time. The lake is gorgeous it's so peaceful and quiet up there. I'd recommend this one for anyone!
26,2016-06-20,[''],This trail is nice and green at the bottom and open at the top. The trail does have a lot of rocks to go over towards the top. We aren't talking rock climbing but a little kid or person with limited mobility might not make it up. The lake is beautiful but freezing. My dogs ran off leash the whole time and had a blast. It was pretty busy on a Saturday and the parking wasn't great. Make sure you take a car that can get up a bumpy dirt road.
