1,2019-09-07,['hiking'],Trail looks way different from a few weeks ago. Prior to the big water/rock slide. Still pretty. But not like it was. Used to have less small rocks and sand. More dangerous now because the pebbles make it stick around the water. Hopefully the water will wash away most of the sand. We did seem many lizards this time.
2,2019-09-05,['hiking'],It's a very quick hike to the fall but includes a lot of climbing over larger boulders to get to the falls which can be more difficult at times. Definitely worth the quick hike though!
3,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"This was a fun trail. My son (2) and I veered to the left and found several spots to play in the water. It was also sandy and soft, maybe due to the slides. "
4,2019-08-31,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
5,2019-08-31,['hiking'],This trail is so short it hardly feels like a hike. We like to bring the kids here to rock climb. The creek provides some entertainment when they're not climbing. The soil is loose since the rock slide so I was a bit more cautious of where they explored this time around. We love Lisa Falls.
6,2019-08-28,['hiking'],"The recent mudslide has changed the landscapes a bit, big boulders that were there are all moved around now. Still a fun place for the kids to play in the water. There actually seams to be more room to play in the water now and it is easy to watch the kids as the play now too. "
7,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Very nice small trail. Falls r great viewing and the accompanying water that flows downwards is nice to sit along and splash on face. Can follow trail south to make it longer.  Must go.
8,2019-08-25,['hiking'],Good for kids. I'd go hear just to sit and have a lunch with the family. 
9,2019-08-16,['hiking'],"Loved this trail with my 4.5, 2.5, and 9 month old. It’s worth doing just to see the impact of the recent mudslide. You can walk right up to the falls. Very easy for the kids to do and they loved playing in the water at the top. "
10,2019-08-12,['hiking'],Easy hike! There are no signs showing the entrance but you will see tons of cars (or use google maps and look for Lisa fls). The whole hike is uphill but short! Beautiful views! 
11,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'washed out']","PSA On August 8th, there was a rockslide/mudslide that completely changed the course of the stream flowing out of the waterfall. The waterfall flows an extra 10 ft down roughly due to the large amount of erosion that occurred. I would avoid hiking above the waterfall until late this fall or next year due to the loose soil and the threat of another mudslide. You’re still fine to hike just to the waterfall, there aren’t any big obstacles. "
12,2019-08-06,"['hiking', 'rocky']","hike was great.  not sure I'd say easy because it's uphill from the very start and very rocky,  but it is very short so it's not too big a deal.  my 3yr old did with little help.  super fun!"
13,2019-08-02,['hiking'],"Fun small hike we added on to other hikes we did in Little Cottonwood Canyon. My kids (10, 8, 5, 2) all were able to do this, but my two year old needed a hand to do the water crossings and get over some of the big boulders. Next time we thought it would be fun to bring water shoes to play at the base of the falls. It took us about 10 minutes to get to the base of falls. Trail and parking is on the left hand side of the road if you're going up the canyon. There is no sign for the trailhead. "
14,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"Very nice trail great for kids, just had trouble finding it. There are no signs that point toward the trail. But overall had a great time!"
15,2019-07-16,"['hiking', 'rocky']",A little steep and rocky but doable! Gorgeous! 
16,2019-07-15,['hiking'],Beautiful area! Fun place for kids and to put a hammock up and relax. Lots of space for picnics! Lots of mosquitos. 
17,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Very easy “hike”, exactly what we were going for. My 2 year old did it with a a little hand holding, and did awesome! Water falls were pretty, and just the perfect short hike for our 2, 4, and 6 yr old kids"
18,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Very easy, rewarding hike. Water is just gushing down. Kid friendly, very short, rocky hike."
19,2019-07-07,"['hiking', 'rocky']",This was a super short hike but very enjoyable. The falls are beautiful. It’s a wonderful place to take a lunch and eat on a rock near the waterfall. Will absolutely come back to this. 
20,2019-07-04,['hiking'],Super quick. It’s not a hike and more just a quick walk to see a pretty rocky waterfall. Great to just get out of the couch and see nature. 
21,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"“Hiked” this Friday 6/28. Very very short (.15 one way). The falls were cool. Also, anytime you get to drive through LCC it’s cool."
22,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Great hike! Perfect for kiddos/toddlers. Not very steep or long at all. The water helps cool down. We stopped along the way many times to see the water come down and play with rocks. Beautiful and great for a shady picnic!
23,2019-06-29,['hiking'],Fun for everybody 
24,2019-06-28,['hiking'],Super fun short hike to a beautiful unique waterfall! Easy for any hiking level
25,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Short and sweet! Very beautiful hike. So if you park across the street where it says “little cottonwood hike” cross the street and it’s on the right. You will see the trail. 
26,2019-06-23,['hiking'],Very beautiful falls and really fun to walk through a small bit of water/pebbles to get to. Beautiful trees! Hiked this yesterday! 
27,2019-06-20,['hiking'],Big Reward for very little effort! Visiting from out of town and this was a quick and spectacular hike. Highly recommend! When you’re done walk across the roadway to the Little Cottonwood Trail to see some beautiful and powerful rapids!
28,2019-06-15,['hiking'],Super short hike up LCC. My kids do it in crocs. That’s how short and easy it is. Plus good for the water cross. Water running loud and fast this time of year!
29,2019-06-14,[''],This was a great hike. We went with 3 younger big kids and they loved it. The water fall was beautiful! We enjoyed that it wasn't to hard or far!
30,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Busy, but great kid friendly trail with a nice rewarding waterfall."
31,2019-06-09,['hiking'],Took my 3 year old and he loved it. Super short! 
32,2019-06-09,['hiking'],This hike/walk is incredible. It is super short and so pretty. Right now is the best time for sure. Family friendly. 
33,2019-06-09,['hiking'],"With the wet spring this (and every other fall in UT) is flowing like Ive never seen.  Beautiful, easy, kid friendly hike.  You will get feet wet in freezing water but easy to traverse"
34,2019-06-08,['hiking'],Short hike. Slot of water coming down right now and very cold. But so beautiful.
35,2019-06-04,['hiking'],Beautiful but there’s so much water and runoff right now you have to cross water that’s deeper than ankle-deep (and freezing!) to see the falls. Wear water proof boots or get ready to have freezing wet feet!
36,2019-06-02,[''],"Super pretty. Easy, short hike. Waterfall is beautiful. I love the rocks. Nice spot to relax."
37,2019-06-01,['hiking'],Great bang for the buck. 
38,2019-05-27,['hiking'],Super pretty. Super easy. Interested to see what the raps and climbs would be like. Chains at the top. Hmmm.
39,2019-05-26,['hiking'],A quick hike up to see the falls.   Good for kids and people visiting from out of town.    Pretty.   
40,2019-05-19,['hiking'],Yesterday it rained pretty hard but it looked great this morning.
41,2019-05-18,['hiking'],
42,2019-05-16,['hiking'],Loved this! Quick hike with beautiful Falls! It was fun climbing some of the granite boulders. 
43,2019-05-16,['hiking'],No snow! Quick and pretty!!!
44,2019-05-05,[''],No snow on trail. Really really short hike but nice waterfall.
45,2019-04-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Easy going. Great views. Pretty thawed out already. No snow on the trail.
46,2019-04-05,['hiking'],"We went on April 4th, and there were still large patches of snow on the trail because of the precipitous winter.  I hiked it with my 5 kids ranging from 5 to 11 years old.  The snow made for an extra challenge, but the hike was short enough that it worked out fine and our kids loved it."
47,2019-01-04,[''],"One of my very favorite hikes for kids. Shaded and short, also the area right by the waterfall is shallow enough that my little kids can take their shoes off and walk around while they explore. Water can be chilly though so best on a warm day."
48,2018-09-30,['hiking'],Fun hike for our girls. A quick walk would be more accurate. We enjoyed climbing up above the falls and seeing the autumn reds and yellows.
49,2018-09-03,['hiking'],"Short and sweet! I wouldn’t rate this hard at all, there were plenty of young children and families coming and going. Beautiful walk and beautiful falls. We love this!"
50,2018-09-02,[''],Short but fun!
51,2018-07-29,['hiking'],"Our family loves Lisa Falls, but it is very disappointing that people have tagged the rocks. Very disgraceful!"
52,2018-07-21,[''],"Fun little hike, short and sweet! Rock trail so ankle support shoes recommended. 
Downside to the hike is when you make it to the falls there is inappropriate graffiti all over the rocks."
53,2018-07-21,[''],Super Easy with young kids.
54,2018-07-15,[''],Beautiful but the graffiti was disappointing on the boulders near the falls...
55,2018-07-11,[''],"Only hiked up to the base of the first waterfall.   Don't have any experience rock climbing or scrambling so I didn't even consider trying to get to the upper falls.   If I ever learn I will go back and attempt the full hike.   If you want a short, shady hike with a waterfall then try this one and just go to the base of the first waterfall.   It was pretty nice just sitting on the big rocks at the falls.  If you want some more hiking you can go across the road too and hike around..... pretty nice river down there."
56,2018-07-07,[''],"We found this fall to be very beautiful and peaceful. Up to the fall I would rate it Moderate. There are some steep areas, and it is a lot of rocks you have to climb. I was able to do the hike by myself with a 7 year old and a 4 year old. I would reccomend this hike."
57,2018-06-27,[''],Cool hike but nothing too special. Not sure we this is rated hard. It’s rocky but they are big and easy to get up. Somehow this is rated hard and Lower Bell Canyon is rated easy but this was way easier than Bell Canyon?
58,2018-06-26,['hiking'],"Good, shady, short hike to the water fall. 

The waterfall was neat, but the boulders were a little too big for my kiddos 5 & 3. The boulders also went down the side of the mountain pretty steep.

There was an INSANE amounts of kids (mainly older) pushing their way around. The topper was the graffiti all over! We maybe stayed 15 minutes before leaving."
59,2018-06-26,[''],"I was glad there were posts here to say how easy of a hike.it is to the bottom of the falls or I might have not checked out this amazing waterfall and passed it by.  It was a super short hike to the bottom, but such a beautiful unique waterfall.  The drive in Little cottonwood canyon was also just stunning.  just make sure you don't on off hours so you don't have to fight the crowds. Check out my post for a 360 degree visual of the hike.  https://shaunasadventures.blogspot.com/2018/06/360-adventure-little-cottonwood-canyon.html?m=1"
60,2018-06-24,['hiking'],Fun for the kids to play at the top
61,2018-06-23,['hiking'],Short family friendly shady trail up to the lower falls. Offers great views and lots of rocks to climb around on. My kids really liked playing in the water and climbing the rocks.
62,2018-06-22,['hiking'],"Nice shady, short hike to a pretty waterfall.  Fun for the whole family.  The graffiti this time was so disappointing!"
63,2018-06-09,['hiking'],Not much water coming over the falls this time of year
64,2018-06-03,['hiking'],Super short hike to waterfall. Perfect for families with kids. Shady the whole way with sun at the waterfall.
65,2018-05-16,[''],"My husband and I completed this hike on May 5, 2018. Maybe this is a fun, quick hike with a mildly impressive waterfall.  The trail is mostly walking up stairs, and a steep path, but it's over before you know it.  We didn't know that there was a higher waterfall... we just saw the first one!"
66,2018-05-11,['hiking'],Amazing hike!
67,2018-02-18,[''],I would not climb up the falls. That causes a large portion of the salt lake search and rescue calls... just look at it from the bottom. It’s still cool.
68,2017-10-15,[''],Pretty but not easy. Short doable hike to lower falls but the rest of hike is boulder climbing.
69,2017-09-11,[''],"This trial is cool but defiantly not family friendly if your trying to get the the end. First little bit to the initial falls is family friendly, everything after that is pretty much Rick climbing."
70,2017-09-05,['walking'],A very short walk into a decently impressive waterfall- a great option for kids!
71,2017-09-05,[''],"More like .25 miles to the lower pool (accessible without climbing gear). A fantastic place for the kids to stay lash around and explore. A favorite we come back to if we are short on time and want a pretty, fun escape in the canyons!"
72,2017-09-03,[''],Cool little hike with an amazing waterfall!
73,2017-09-03,[''],Easy five minute hike to lower falls. Dont attempt upper falls unless you have climbing equipment-my advice. Lots of kids and people. Beautiful but Im a hiker not a climber.
74,2017-08-13,[''],Not what we were expecting. Pretty once you reach the the falls though. If you want to go beyond the falls you really need rock climbing gear.  But nice little climb .  We went across the way to another trail that was really pretty once we were done with Lisa falls.
75,2017-08-11,[''],Very short hike.
76,2017-07-28,[''],5 star if you are hiking with children.   We took our 2 yo and 4 yo boys and they loved climbing over all the rocks.  I'd give it 2-3 stars as a solo hiker just because it's super short.
77,2017-07-25,[''],"Short, and beautiful!"
78,2017-07-23,['hiking'],Great short hike for families. It is super short with the fun waterfall at the end that kids can play in.
79,2017-07-22,['hiking'],The trail is very is easy to hike and the falls is spectacular!!!!!
80,2017-07-04,['hiking'],NOT 1.1 MILES. Only .1 to the falls and the trail Sutter is not easy. More like rock climbing. Beautiful lower falls just don't expect much of a hike.
81,2017-07-03,[''],A nice trip to a small waterfall.  A great opportunity for family members from sea level to experience the Wasatch
82,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"Great little hike with kids. The kids loved the waterfall and playing in the water.  It was shorter than expected,  nonetheless beautiful!"
83,2017-06-29,[''],"short hike! Wasnt hard for the kids, super cool water fall and great to walk around in and cool off."
84,2017-06-24,['hiking'],Took the kids. I'd say it's a so-so waterfall. Not much of a hike. Scramble over a few roots and boulders and you're there. I'd tack this on to another hike but I wouldn't do it by itself next time.
85,2017-06-24,['hiking'],This was a fun quick hike. We went off trail a little and that was super fun too.
86,2017-06-22,[''],Great waterfall! Short and easy! A great place to practice rock climbing! :)
87,2017-06-22,[''],Super easy. Super quick. great waterfall.
88,2017-06-22,[''],"Not really a hike, but a great photo op "
89,2017-06-21,[''],very nice hike. must do
90,2017-06-19,['hiking'],"A short, steep, and rocky hike with a BIG payoff!  Lisa Falls was beautiful, and the kids enjoyed playing in the water and scampering on the rocks.  Great hike for kids!"
91,2017-06-12,[''],Super easy hike
92,2017-06-08,['hiking'],Nice easy hike to take the kids. Beautiful waterfall to play around.
93,2017-06-07,[''],"Very short walk up to the falls. It is a perfect little nature walk, only around 1/4 mile to the falls despite what the hike says. Very nice and easy, the only problem is that there are almost always groups of people there. Great waterfall though!"
94,2017-06-06,[''],"So relaxing! Super easy, more of a sight seeing attraction and a place to take your kids but beautiful a must see."
95,2017-06-05,['hiking'],"This trail is amazingly beautiful at the top, but very dangerous. Most people only go to the bottom of the bottom fall, which is a short walk from the road but the whole trail goes to the very top waterfall. However, getting to the top fall is dangerous. You have to scale small cliffs and large rocks which were either very dusty or wet. You need good shoes. Be careful if you scale past the bottom waterfall! Last year alone I heard about two people falling, both were young adults, one died and one sustained a traumatic brain injury. Please be careful!"
96,2017-06-02,[''],"Short hike, great for kids. The waterfall is really pretty and my kids enjoyed playing in the water."
97,2017-05-29,['hiking'],Fun quick hike. We went on Memorial Day so it was crazy busy- I imagine it wouldn't be as bad on a regular day.
98,2017-05-29,[''],"Heavily trafficked, short hike. Beautiful falls with lots of water! Nice hike for kids."
99,2017-05-28,[''],"Great trail, beautiful waterfall but it was a little shorter than expected. None the less worth your time."
100,2017-05-28,[''],"Great quick hike, kids loved playing on all the rocks"
101,2017-05-27,[''],This was a beautiful hike. Just super short. This app says it's 1.1 miles but my tracker said 0.3. I was a little disappointed. I wanted something longer.
102,2017-05-24,['hiking'],easy. so much water since the snow is melting
103,2017-05-03,['hiking'],"The trail map is deceiving!  It's only about .1 miles to a lower waterfall which is beautiful and fun to climb all over the rocks.  We had fun hiking there with our kids, but we had expected to make the full 1 mile roundtrip hike and could not.  At the first waterfall you basically have to scale a steep rock cliff to continue and we could not do that with our kids.  It was a huge bummer, but I plan to return w/o them next time to see if I can make it to the Upper Falls."
104,2017-04-26,['hiking'],it don't get any shorter than this on a hike! waterfall was beautiful though and felt very secluded even though it's only a stones throw from the road.
105,2017-04-23,['hiking'],"It's a short and easy trail, but really pretty. You might want water shoes to cross a light stream. Good for kids."
106,2017-04-17,[''],Beautiful fall. Easy and short; good for kids.
107,2017-04-15,[''],Accidentally turned back at the first waterfall looking structure and missed out. Keep on hiking. As far as we got was easy with our kids too.
108,2017-04-13,[''],"very easy hike the falls is beautiful. just make sure you park on the left side of the road so you don't hit the bike trail, although it was pretty too. turned 1 mile into 3 mile hike."
109,2017-03-19,['hiking'],"Went with group of friends we surprised how shorty was, but really beautiful water fall. Then went over to little cottonwood trail to get our fill for the day. Will be back with family with this hike."
110,2017-02-17,[''],"Very nice, little trail."
111,2017-02-01,['hiking'],"This trail made me a little nervous because it is only 0.1 miles and I feared that it would not fill up the time that my friends and I seat aside for this hike, but the trail was really nice and we ended playing on the rocks under the falls for about an hour! 
    This location would be ideal for picnics seeing that the short trail leads to a variety of big flat rocks. But watch out because we did run into a few mosquitoes!"
112,2017-01-15,[''],I love this hike. Grow up hiking here. Great for all ages.
113,2016-10-23,[''],"Nice simple hike for the short version. Longer version is more difficult, rocky and steep."
114,2016-10-20,[''],"Short to the main attraction, but you can go up further on the rocks if you want. Awesome views"
115,2016-10-11,[''],"Such a fun little hike! We had a great time and got some amazing photos. The hike itself isn't hard at all. The climb to the upper part of the falls doesn't take long. Most of the granite is really smoothed over from erosion, so be careful. I ended up taking my shoes off to get a better grip with my bare feet."
116,2016-10-04,[''],Very quick but a nice climb at the end.
117,2016-09-15,[''],I hiked this with my 2 year old and 3 year old. They loved playing in the water. It took us less than 10 minutes to get to the waterfall.
118,2016-09-12,[''],"It is an easy hike and the water fall is beautiful. Be careful though, we saw a rattle snake right on the trail! Also, there isn't much parking."
119,2016-09-10,[''],Great for adults that want to do some rock scrambling.
120,2016-09-10,[''],Beautiful scenery. Great hike. Would consider it slightly harder than easy.
121,2016-09-04,['hiking'],Beautiful falls and an easy hike good for all ages
122,2016-08-22,['hiking'],Absolutely gorgeous. Easy hike to the falls but essentially a rock climb if you want to go further. Worth it though!
123,2016-08-20,['hiking'],"Super quick, 5 min hike to a fun, simple waterfall.  Spent the next 2 hours hiking up much higher.  many more waterfalls and fantastic views of the South side of the canyon."
124,2016-08-12,['hiking'],it's a super short hike maybe 5 min. from the parking area. Nice and shaded or you can sit out in the sun on the big granite slabs. Flow of the falls varies from end of spring to end of summer depending on runoff.
125,2016-08-11,[''],"Really quick hike, about 15 minutes to get to fall. Beautiful view, watch out for rattle snakes. There is a rocky formation you can sit on and have a picnic, as I saw a saw a family doing. Off the side, if you hike up the from the left there is a plateau you can sit on about midway of the flowing fall to sit as well, better view from up there."
126,2016-08-08,['hiking'],Great evening hike for the whole family.
127,2016-08-07,[''],Quick walk up the hillside to see the falls. across the road from little cottonwood canyon trailhead so we did both. great for kids
128,2016-08-02,['rock climbing'],"We hiked this with our 5 children, the youngest is 5.

The trailhead isn't marked, but look for cars parked on both sides of the road, GPS signal was weak on our phone and we drove by it the first time.

It is a really short walk to the base of the falls.  Then if you're up for a little easy rock scrambling you can go higher.  At the left side of the base, an often used trail works up to several overlooks and finally after climbing up for about 200ft ends at a flat section of the stream going back approximately 200yds deep into the gorge with incredible views of the mountains across the canyon.  Again we did the scramble/rock-climb in tennis shoes with a 5 year old.  I wouldn't call it -easy-, but it is not difficult.  The first section is the worst because there is a lot of loose dirt and thus a little slippery.  Once you get up about 50' to the first overlook section it is easier going.  At one point about 1/2 way we had to work down and across closer to the stream to get to the easiest path higher.  I found that if I scouted ahead I could find a path easy enough for our 5yr old to climb by himself.  Also, there was never a section where the next ledge/resting spot was more than about a 10' section of footholds.  There were other groups doing this climb with children as well.  The last 20' section the easiest path is to actually cross the stream (over to the right hand side) and the route is easy from there to the large flat section."
129,2016-08-02,[''],This was a very easy hike!! It took us about 5 minutes to get to the falls. But then we explored the falls by basically rock climbing up top. It was so fun! That part was a bit more challenging and scary.
130,2016-07-31,['hiking'],"This is a short but fun hike. The bunny is alive and well, and not shy.  The trail is easy, my daughter is 7 and she did great!  You can play in the water at falls. There are more adventurous trails too, and rock climbing."
131,2016-07-31,[''],"Short hike to falls. Good hike for kids including toddlers. Area for kids to play in water at base of the falls. The kids were entertained for about an hour playing in the water and rocks.

For adventurous adults, u can scramble further up the rocks and follow the waterfalls. It's very beautiful climb but a little dangerous for the average Joe."
132,2016-07-24,[''],"A great little hike! Simple, beautiful falls, room to explore when you get up there."
133,2016-07-15,['hiking'],7.15.16 - I'm still getting emails of hikers seeing the bunny. I'm working with Sandy Animal Rescue - they are trying to rescue the little guy/girl. Please email if you see a black and white bunny on the trail - all info helps. Thanks Polly - Hike on!   pollycairnsathotmail.com
134,2016-07-12,['walking'],Short and sweet. Kids and I watched rock climbers going up and a couple repelling down. Nice place to just chill for a couple hours of play.
135,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"This is a fantastic, short hike with a big waterfall payoff. I took my two boys(6 and 7). It was a great starter to then go to Center Lake. These two made for a great day!"
136,2016-07-09,['hiking'],"Hardly a hike, took about ten min total out and back. Pretty falls though."
137,2016-07-09,[''],Quick jaunt. Good for some small-time scaling.
138,2016-07-08,[''],"Kids loved this hike. Lots of rocks and nice waterfall. Very short, I tracked it as .25 miles for up and back."
139,2016-07-06,['hiking'],"Like other review it is short though I might add that it is rocky for the little ones at the top. Kids loved putting their feet in the water. I highly recommend it for the kids, all others would probably be board with it."
140,2016-07-02,[''],Too short! But awesome. Perfect for little kids
141,2016-07-01,['hiking'],Short and sweet and easy enough for all ages.
142,2016-06-28,[''],"I assume this is to the bottom of the waterfall, there is however the option to climb the water fall. It can get tricky."
143,2016-06-27,[''],Awesome family friendly trail. Loved it.
144,2016-06-27,['hiking'],Great trail for kids. We walked up the stream to the falls and watched rock climbers for a bit while we ate snacks.
145,2016-06-26,[''],"The hike is short, but steep and rocky. It was crowded but great when we got to the falls. Great hike overall and easy enough for me 4 year old."
146,2016-06-26,['hiking'],Great family friendly hike. My 3 and 4 year old love it. It's a short hike up to the falls and the kids love to play in the stream
147,2016-06-25,[''],This hike was short and easy. I love the shade and the waterfall is cool and it's very refreshing.
148,2016-06-24,[''],"very very easy.. may be 10 mins of hiking and you are there!! yes just 10 mis. but you will have to climb the rocks which are easy to do so. its a nice small hike you can go with children's. 

well after seeing the falls we thought it was not a hike at all.. we were down just in half and hour.. so decided to go to little cottonwood trail which is just across the road from this hike. it was easy but a lot longer than Lisa..lol"
149,2016-06-21,['hiking'],"7.15.16 - I'm still getting emails of hikers seeing the bunny.  I'm working with Sandy Animal Rescue - they are trying to rescue the little guy/girl.  Please email if you see a black and white bunny on the trail - all info helps.  Thanks Polly - Hike on!

150,2016-06-21,[''],"Beautiful falls. A bit rocky & crowded. It's about a 10-15min walk from the road to the falls . My 4yrs old was able to do it with minimal assistant. We crossed path with a rattle snack, lizards & a few squirrels. Made my kids day!"
151,2016-06-19,['hiking'],Beautiful but too short.

153,2016-06-16,[''],"It was wonderful and beautiful waterfall. It might be a little difficult for some people rock climbing above the waterfall, but so easy if you hike a lot. It was easy."
154,2016-06-16,[''],If you can walk up two flights of stairs you can do this :) Super easy and lots of rock climbing and exploring for the kids. The falls themselves are gorgeous!
155,2016-06-14,['hiking'],Awesome little walk. Great for kids.
156,2016-06-13,['hiking'],"Fun, short hike with kids. The falls are pretty, not a huge waterfall but the kids enjoyed it."
157,2016-06-13,['hiking'],"Very short trail. I was expecting half mile in half mile out but it took me about 3-5 minutes to hike in with my two year old on my back, pretty steep but not bad. My 2 year old had a lot of fun once we got to the waterfall, jumping on rocks and playing in the shallow parts of the creek and river."
158,2016-06-12,[''],Nice and short. Even our kids were begging for more!
159,2016-06-12,[''],Great trail for kids. Short and shady with the creek to play in. You'll  need to cross the creek at the base of the falls. The creek isn't dangerous even at spring runoff. The trail continues up the left side of the falls which is not recommended for kids. Very steep and hazerdous and potential for falls. It seems like someone gets badly hurt after falling almost every year. Stick to the base of the falls and engoy the views.
160,2016-06-09,[''],"Waterfall was beautiful! While the hike is short, it is pretty steep, so be warned."
161,2016-06-06,[''],Crazy short hike but beautiful with plenty of shade along the path.

167,2016-05-31,['hiking'],Short but steep. Fun waterfall
168,2016-05-30,[''],"It was a riveting 453 steps from the trail head to the falls. It was filled with streams, boulders, and exquisite vistas. It was a nice outing with my less than physically fit family. The drive to the hike was longer than the hike itself and walking from the parking lot dodging cars seemed more strenuous than the hike itself. It's the perfect beginners hike for grandma or a starter for your trail running American Ninja four year old. If you're looking for short and easy, Lisa is your lady!"
169,2016-05-27,['hiking'],"Perfect for our herd of a 5 yo, 4 yo, and 2 yo"
170,2016-05-20,['hiking'],Beautiful quick easy hike rewarded with a beautiful waterfall.  Cute little black and white domestic rabbit at the parking area.  =)  Great after work hike or place to sit and read a book.  Plenty of rocky areas for the kiddos to splash around as well.  If you want a longer hike just cross the road and youll see the trail for the little cottonwood canyon trail.  Beautiful easy hike along the river.
171,2016-05-19,['hiking'],"Why does the description say 1.1 mile hike, when everyone is saying it is just a 5 min. walk up a trail to the falls??"

Anyone hiking lisa falls - I'm still looking for help to rescue the black and white domestic rabbit located at the start of the trail - I've been emailed several times this week that the rabbit has been spotted. It appears someone left him there. If anyone can help and rescue I would be happy to give a reward and I will adopt. The rabbit was found each day around 4pm on the left of the start of the trail just off the small gravel parking area. It appears he may be living under some tree roots/rock up a bit on the left. Please follow me or email me pollycairnsathotmail.com. I'm out of the area an unable to check.  THANK YOU!"
174,2016-05-02,[''],"It's an awesome little place to hangout. But it's not a ""hike"". It's a short walk. I like to set up my hammock here though, with the creek and small waterfall, it's super relaxing."
175,2016-05-01,[''],Really pretty  short walk great get away when your running out of time climbing also a plus for easy access and has the rockies
176,2016-04-19,['hiking'],Great short hike to take little ones up. Wasn't able to get up above the falls because of the small ones with us. Maybe next time. Beautiful falls regardless. Can't beat the view.

178,2016-04-03,[''],It's a short hike to the waterfalls but the real treat is climbing up to the top of the waterfalls. Absolutely beautiful!
179,2016-04-02,['hiking'],Ok
180,2016-03-31,['walking'],Nice short walk.
181,2016-03-06,[''],"Can be a very short hike, but if you choose to make it longer it gets gorgeous as you go up the falls. But be careful it can be a little dangerous if you're not paying attention. There are about 3-5 falls as you continue up and it keeps getting better"
182,2015-10-27,['hiking'],"I do love this one but I wouldn't exactly call this a hike. It takes all of two minutes to get to the falls from the road. But you walk a trail that gains an extremely minimal amount of elevation. What it lacks in distance it makes up for in gorgeous scenery, especially in autumn. Makes for a good after work jaunt."
183,2015-10-24,['cross country skiing'],Great  thanks
184,2015-08-25,['hiking'],Went with a few friends on a weekday. Took the directions that Lizz Daley provided. Short walk to a beautiful spot. If you climb above the falls there's a great view. I don't recommend taking small children up above. There were hooks for people rock climbing and a nice little secluded area. Highly recommend if you have a little time to kill.
185,2015-08-11,['hiking'],Loved it. Beautiful views.
186,2015-08-10,[''],This hike is great for small children. It's short and has rocks and water to play in at the top.
187,2015-08-09,['hiking'],Good short hike when you're in area but not the main event. Good area for rock climbing/scrambling. Not a lot of space at the falls and the hike is extremely short so a few small groups can make it seem very crowded.
188,2015-07-18,['walking'],"Quick 5min walk from the car to the falls. Directly across the street from Little Cottonwood Trail parking. 

Recommended for kids. There's also a trail west of the fall for adults to go above the fall and beyond. 

Rock climbers are there every time I've went to scale the walls."
189,2015-07-13,['hiking'],"Really small hike. Terrain is quite rocky. There isnt any marker to show that there is a trail. Please follow the instructions exactly as Mademoiselle Lizz Daley has mentioned. She is right on. It is bit difficult to find without cars parked. 

Not suitable for elderly. Kids will enjoy the rocks and the cool water fall."
190,2015-07-06,[''],"Super short hike, but beautiful waterfall. Worth the drive!"
191,2015-07-02,[''],Short walk to the falls. Really nice in the early evening.
192,2015-06-21,['hiking'],Great little walk. Fun for kids to play in the water just below the falls. Bring water shoes if you've got em.
193,2015-06-16,['hiking'],"How to Get There: Take the 6200 S. exit off of 215. Turn east, towards the mountains. Continue on Wasatch Blvd. Pass Big Cottonwood Canyon, keep following the same road up and it will take you right to Little Cottonwood Canyon. Once you enter the canyon you will see a Gate A, one of the ones that they use to close the whole road. Pass Gate A, Gate B and a tall brown pole on the right hand side. After this pole, there is a pull off area on the right hand side, then one on the left hand side directly after that. The left hand area is where you want to park. Trail starts right in the middle of the treeline. No visible trail markers. 

This was the perfect hike for us. We went with 6 kids ranging in age from 9-18 months. We obviously carried the 18 month old, but all the other kids did splendidly. The hike was so short we didn't even have time to get tired. Trail is a little hard to see sometimes when it gets rocky, but you'll be fine. The kids had such a blast playing in the water at the top. Beautiful waterfall, saw lots of other people so maybe go in the morning or early afternoon to avoid a huge crowd. A fan favorite for sure."
194,2015-06-15,[''],Super easy hike for a five and six year old. The waterfall was beautiful. The trail had things to see and do along the way. Would recommend for new hikers or those with little ones.
195,2015-06-13,[''],Nice short hike to the falls. So refreshing to wade around in the cool water!
196,2015-06-09,[''],It was awesome and perfect for little kids
197,2015-06-06,[''],"Pretty sweet. Short walk to falls once we were there we played on the rocks, checked out the falls, and played in the river."
198,2014-09-14,['hiking'],"Nice little path. Took the kids. It was a little too right for my 2 year old, but since the two was so short it wasn't a big deal. I was surprised to see water as late in the summer as we are, but there was enough for us to play in at the top."
199,2014-09-01,['hiking'],"Short trail, pretty rocky. The falls are nice, but not a of water this time of year. Saw quite a few people rock climbing."
200,2014-07-30,[''],"Hard to call this a trail. Its a path, just like Hidden Falls in BCC.  And, just like Hidden Falls in BCC, these paths are primarily used by climbers.  If you go, be courteous to the climbers and give them the room they need,  they will almost always be at Lisa Falls."
201,2014-07-23,['hiking'],The hike to the falls is super easy and not very rewarding. But if you climb over the top of the waterfall its amazing. We just kept going farther and farther up the canyon with small waterfalls every fifty feet or so that you have to climb up. It was a blast. Once you get over the first waterfall you're encased in granite slab walls on both sides with granite beneath you and an excellent view of the canyon. I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to do just a little bit of rock climbing. Go around and above the waterfall.
202,2014-07-15,['nature trips'],"2014 July 13 - It's not obvious where it is. According to the mile markers on the road, it's between 6 and 7. Heading up the canyon, it's on the left (North) side of the road. The trailhead is marked by a large 30"" pale gray rock at the far edge of a pullout.  Very short trail. Most of it is steep dirt with roots. 
The last part is stream bed rocks. On the way up the trail, we saw three different places with lizards sunning themselves on the rocks. Yellow swallowtail butterflies and birds. No litter! Tree cover until you get to the falls. At the falls you can scamper on rocks and wade up to your ankles. This was a perfect nature ""hike"" for our little ones (5 & 2yo)."
203,2014-06-15,['hiking'],"Very short ""hike."" The falls are beautiful, most of the walk is tree covered. If you like climbing, you can scale the falls although the rocks could be slippery, so be careful. We treked along the riverbank for an hour or so ending up pretty ""lost"" which was nice."
204,2013-09-22,['hiking'],Short and sweet.  Directly across the street from Little Cottonwood trail.  Not much water this time of year. Very steep and rocky.
205,2013-08-14,['hiking'],"Couldn't find it, so many different trails "
206,2013-06-03,['hiking'],"Very small walk, close to the road, yet very beautiful and worth the visit. "
207,2012-06-06,['hiking'],You can't really consider this a hike as it is super short.  It would be a good stop if you are already up the canyon.
208,2012-06-04,['walking'],"A cool place to go if you are a rock climber too. be sure to take your gear, there are rings placed in the rock for such adventurers "
209,2011-06-22,['hiking'],One of my favorite short hikes. Such a beautiful waterfall and if you feel like it you can hike up the west side of the waterfall (very steep & difficult climb) to follow the river back and get a higher view above the falls. It's fun to just be at the base and watch the powerful water come down too.
210,2011-04-29,['hiking'],2.7 miles up Little Cottonwood Canyon is a bend in the road. The falls trail head is unmarked. Look for a small clearing on the north side of the road. You can park there or in the larger area on the opposite side of the road. The trail is easily followed once you're on it. About half way up you can hear the water flowing and finally see the falls when you're right there at the base. In the spring the water flows higher than in the late summer. I would recommend visiting when the water flow is higher. My kids had a ball at the base of the falls wading and getting wet. Definately worth a look.
