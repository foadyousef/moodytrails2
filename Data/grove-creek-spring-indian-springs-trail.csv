You might get lost for a moment, but once you find the path it some of the most beautiful landscape. Hopefully you aren't afraid of heights, because there are some narrow, steep sections."

2,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"This is a great hike with expansive views of Utah Lake, the valley and canyon that many people even in Utah County don’t know about. On a Saturday morning (today, 7/27/19) between 7:30 and 9 AM I only passed three or four hikers on the way up and then plenty more on the way down. The destination is the waterfall, or series of waterfalls, about 50 min. up the trail, that you only get a glimpse of as you get closer and then you’re right on top of it. But there’s so much water right now it’s absolutely amazing. If you’re there to camp, keep going and you can find a nice camping spot with fire rings and plenty of shade about a quarter to half mile past the bridge. One of my favorite hikes in Utah County. This is a great year to do it!"
3,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"Tough in the heat before the more shaded portions in the pines near the top. Beautiful views, several stream crossings, a crystal clear and cold spring on top (that I did drink from directly - know the risks and what you're doing before attempting unfiltered/treated water consumption), and an overall great time. Bring plenty of water or a filter to replenish safely along the way."

5,2019-06-18,['hiking'],Good trail. No snow up to the flats where we camped on June 18.
6,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Let me start by saying I'm torn with my rating...If it weren't for the 1+ miles each way where one walks on a narrow trail littered with shale rock with thirty mph winds (7 June 19) then this may have been my top Utah County hike ever.  The runoff right now is incredible.  Once you cross the amazing creek (awesome photos), then the trail turns into a beautiful pine lined meandering path up to a meadow and spring...loves it.  I personally wouldn't take my little ones (5 under the age of 9) as I would constantly fear for their safety, but I will do this one again!"
7,2019-05-13,"['hiking', 'no shade']","Took the three kids along. We made it a half mile up before we found a nice spot by the creek with shade to eat, then turned around. Nice canyon, but not much shade. And a decent amount of traffic for a weekday."
8,2019-05-13,"['hiking', 'no shade']",
9,2019-05-04,['hiking'],The trail was perfect! No snow. Loved hiking so close to the edge of the cliff! No shade so this would be very hot once the temperature starts climbing.
10,2019-04-21,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Hiking is good up to the bench at the top of the falls. Past that there is snow on the trail and you’ll do a good bit of slipping and sliding. We went up to the springs and ended up with wet feet but the temps were very nice that high up. Give it a couple weeks and the trail should be good to go above the falls.

13,2018-07-23,['hiking'],"Great trail with several different types of trails, the app says 5.6 Miles but it is more like 6.8.  The views are great and the walk back is much easier than getting up there!  Took about 4 hours and we spent time enjoying the scenes along the way."
14,2018-07-23,[''],Much nicer trail road compared with Battle Creek - better views also. Highly recommended. Maybe back in fall time.
15,2018-07-18,['hiking'],It was fun and really beautiful. Not hard at all!
16,2018-05-20,['hiking'],"Though I like to think Im an advanced hiker, Im kinda out of shape, so this hike was a little rough for me. There are some long stretches of the trail that have no shade, and the loose scree can be a little challenging. That being said, its a great hike and well worth it. My hubby ( whos in way better shape) loved it, and our two dogs also had a lot of fun. 
Another note, use the map or keep a picture of it in your head, we got a little lost when we went the wrong way at one of the forks. The main one I think is the triangular fork in the rocky clearing, make sure to stay to the right."
17,2018-05-07,['hiking'],The beginning had a nice view but wasn’t my favorite. Once we got to the waterfalls the trail got very beautiful and fun to hike. I would definitely recommend to a friend
18,2018-02-04,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite local trails. I really enjoy the mix of rocky exposures, wooded areas, and open meadows along the way."
19,2017-12-16,[''],"I tried going December 16, I was not able to finish the trail as there was an unpassible part where small logs ran across a river, they had snow on them so I could not cross. I I would recommend this trail because Ivan tell it would be a great trail in the summer, just not the winter."
20,2017-11-23,[''],moderate trail. out and back to Indian campground. beautiful foliage for late fall. mice water features. trail was clear.
21,2017-11-08,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail yesterday—11-7-17. The trail was still dry and free of mud and snow. Just went to the falls/Springs. Spectacular views, but the narrow rocky trail on the side of the mountain was unnerving. I was wishing for a trail in the bottom of the canyon to see some of the falls up close and personal. Would not take children or dogs on this trail as one false step would be tragic. The climb was not difficult. We have such amazing beauty in our backyards!"
22,2017-10-09,[''],Breath taking views and fairly rugged terrain right in our back yard.
23,2017-09-17,[''],trail kinda disappeared. ok hike. short maybe 3 mile round trip. you get a good view of pleasant grove but that about it
24,2017-09-04,['hiking'],
25,2017-09-03,[''],Amazing waterfalls! Good place to take our dog and kid to camp for a night.
26,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"Nice scenic hike with a nice variety of features, ending at the spring. Start early and bring plenty of water if going in Summer."
27,2017-06-11,['hiking'],Really cool hike. Lives the rocks exposure in the first 1/3. Will definitely be back. Mets up with connector trails once you hit the meadows.
28,2017-05-23,['backpacking'],Awesome hike. I went right when you get to the sign and if you go there about 200 yards and turn right again you will see a teepee made by some previous hikers. I had an awesome experience and would love to do it again this summer when I get out of school
29,2017-05-20,[''],The first part is rocky with not much to see until you get to the falls. Push yourself and get to the campground. It's worth it.
30,2017-05-09,['hiking'],Relatively low traffic. Be advised the upper 0.75 mi or so above the falls does not have solid trails marked in the alltrails layer. Some of the tracks are bushwhacking along the creeks - scrutinize them before committing to one. DL the topo and or satellite layers for back-up.
31,2017-05-08,['hiking'],
32,2017-05-07,[''],"I only experienced this on the way down as part of the Battle Creek/Grove Creek loop. Really rocky towards the bottom. Once you get to the waterfall and go into the trees it is beautiful! I went early May so the campground wasn't just stunningly beautiful. Understandable considering we're barely, barely coming out of winter. The spring is nice."
33,2017-04-20,['hiking'],This is probably my new favorite hike. It is fairly steep in several places but level enough that it was enjoyable while still being a challenge. There are beautiful waterfalls to look at most of the way and is a beautiful hike overall. We hiked to the springs which is about 3 miles and decided to go back down instead of doing the loop because there was a lot of snow past the springs. I highly recommend it!
34,2017-04-11,['hiking'],
35,2017-02-09,['hiking'],We hiked all the way to the falls where there is a bench and a bridge then turned back. Noticed you could go further but we weren't sure where that led. AMAZING HIKE! Has spectacular overlooks and beautiful scenery. Probably one of my favorites by far!
36,2016-07-01,['hiking'],There's so many different trails you can take on this hike! I love it!
37,2016-05-23,['backpacking'],"I hadn't been backpacking in about 15 years. This was a great trail to get back into it. My brother and I went up and started or hike around 4pm. We took our time and it took us about 2.5hrs to get to the falls (I'm a big guy who is out of shape, carrying a pack... I took plenty of breaks). The views are absolutely gorgeous, especially the trip back down. We had a perfect day for the hike. There are several spots that would be slick and dangerous in rain or wet ground. I would not recommend for ""inexperienced children"" due to slick rock as and narrow trail close to steep edges. We went about another mile beyond the falls, found a nice place to set up camp. During the day (May 11) we got burnt, at night it got quite cold, but there was no frost on the ground. Overall - amazing trip that has reignited my passion for camping."
38,2016-05-18,['hiking'],"Not a bad hike. It's a good trail for some running or hiking before work in the morning, but I wouldn't go out of my way to hike it. There are some interesting stretches of trail that are rather exposed, and the waterfall at the top is nice. It is very exposed to the sun with very little shade for the first two miles, so go early in the morning or wear protection."
39,2016-05-15,['hiking'],"A decent hike! I agree with the ""moderate"" rating.  There isn't much shade so go early to avoid the heat.  There are a few forks near the beginning so just be mindful of following makings. Make sure on your way up to stop a few times to check out the view of the valley!  There is a bench near the big waterfall,  then a little ways further there's a bridge over the river.  After that,  you can hike up a ways through a meadow to the campground. Beyond this,  you can go further to a higher viewpoint but I think just at the campground is as nice if you don't want to go as far.  
It wasn't my very favorite hike,  so not one I would repeat anytime soon,  but it was enjoyable!
It took us 3.5 hours to go from the trailhead to the campground and back."
40,2016-04-10,['hiking'],Easy to follow trail. Long dug-way high up on the north side until you cross the creek at the bottom of a nice casdade
41,2015-11-23,[''],"I only made it a bit past the bridge because of the snow, but it is a definite repeater!"
42,2015-11-07,[''],Steep.  Great workout.  Do this hike in the morning as the trail is exposed to the sun most of the day.
43,2015-10-09,[''],"This was an amazing hike. The changing colors makes it even better. This is a steep climb most of the way, and leans more to moderate because of it, but the views are worth it."
44,2015-09-23,['camping'],"Great hike over all. Rather steep all the way up. Even steeper coming down the other side. If you are camping, I recommend making it a two nighter.  Stay at the spring the 1st night then continue up the trail until it meets a dirt road. The road goes for about a mile before turning back into a trail. follow the road downhill south past a very large meadow and follow the signs to Battle Creek. When you see the creek through the trees on the left there is a nice camping spot right there. It's about two more miles down to Battle Creek Falls. The trail down Battle Creek will be easier to find in the Fall after the seasons foot traffic."
45,2015-03-21,['hiking'],"Overall, I enjoyed this hike. The trail is very well kept, absent a few areas where the grade is the steepest and it is washed out a bit. The grade on the accent is relatively consistent, and moderate, with very few strenuous areas, and absolutely nothing technical. Great hike to bring along the dog, unless they don't follow voice command well, as there are areas through the canyon that are, well, cliffs. A gentleman I ran into on my climb said his dog ""fell off"" the cliff last time they were out, and he isn't taking it anymore. I did this trail in March, and there was no snow until you reached the alpine  level, where in many places it was marshy and there were occasional patches of thick snow. No need to take tons of water on this hike, as there can be plenty of places to fill up along the way. Be mindful in the canyon during the summer, as it's relatively exposed the entire way, and will be very hot."
46,2014-06-29,['hiking'],"The first little bit is on a dirt road that's big enough to drive a car on.  Then the trail takes off to the left and up.  The first section on the more narrow trail is fairly steep in the beginning but once you get past that the rest of the hike is not bad.  I'd suggest you start early and/or pick a cooler day because there isn't much foliage to cover you and it gets hot.  Once you get to the springs and waterfall, and go beyond that there is plenty of trees and foliage and it's nice and cool from there on.  I would have liked to have gone further past the springs than we did... maybe next time."
47,2014-04-28,['hiking'],"This is a great hike. One of my new favorites. I only day-hiked this one this time, but I plan on going back the next time I want a quick overnighter fix. Lots of room to camp at the end of the trail. The trail difficulty is about perfect. I'm an average fitness level and although the trail kept my heart rate up the whole time but not bad enought that I needed any major breaks. Much of the trail ( until you cross the bridge and start hiking south) is very exposed. I'd be nervous about taking any children higher up on this trail, but shouldn't be a problem for fit adults. Easy access to water the whole time.  Water is coming directly from a spring and it's fast moving. So I didn't worry about filtering and it's been fine. But it's usually smarter to not risk it. Ice cold, delicious mountain water. Nothing like it.  This is a simply wonderful trail, you won't be disappointed."
48,2013-09-02,['camping'],We backpacked up to a small meadow about a half mile above the waterfall. The trail was well-maintained and the views going up of Utah valley were amazing. I would definitely go up there again.
49,2013-08-18,['hiking'],"An easy hike with great views of Utah valley, beautiful creeks, and a pretty waterfall. A little steep at first but smooth sailing the rest of the way. This hike is one of the best-kept secrets of Pleasant Grove, so the trail is never too crowded. Love it."
50,2013-06-22,['camping'],"Awesome Trail! You can shoot off East by North-East and head a couple miles into the falls (a breathtaking experience), or you can stick around the open ground and pack in a tent and some food for a really quick overnighter with a good view of the valley. As always, bring bug-spray, they were pretty hungry last time i was up there. =P"
51,2012-10-09,['hiking'],Great trail for a hike. Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Honestly the first part was the worse mostly because of the loose rocks on the trail. After that the trail is not too difficult. Just a few steep places.  Lots of places you could fall if not careful though so keep kids close to you. Would not hike this in the dark at all. Bring a light if you're going to be hiking down in the dark. 
52,2012-08-15,['hiking'],"Love this trail and camping at Grove Creek Spring! The trail is great and can go as fast or as slow as you want it. The views of Utah Valley are great. The camping around Grove Creek Spring is open and there is tons of space, plus you have a great view of Timp and fresh water! One of my favorites."
53,2006-07-17,[''],"This is a great day hike.  The hike up is beautiful.  Incredible views, amazing waterfalls.  I was rying to hike it quickly but had to keep stopping to take pictures to share with non hikers. It was that beautiful!  The open meadow and springs at the top were very calming and mellow.  The hike down was a little harder to follow and not nearly as picturesque but still a nice walk."
