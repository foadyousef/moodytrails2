3,2019-07-03,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'scramble']","Awesome mountain views, well maintained trail and some excitement towards the Black Mountain peak. A great outing! I would add that we did this hike in the morning on a pretty cool day, sunscreen and plenty of water for this hike are a must. Even with an ample supply of water doing this trail in the heat of the summer might be pretty miserable. "
4,2019-06-08,['hiking'],"I only logged 8.1 miles. Since I hiked alone, I didn't feel comfortable doing the final section with drop offs and scrambling involved. Still, I logged over 25,000 steps, so it's all good. There are a couple of shorter steep climbs and then one that is killer workout for legs and calves. Gorgeous views all the way up."
5,2019-06-05,['trail running'],Moderately difficult with some very steep sections. Little tree cover which makes for great views. Not too rocky which made it easier on the ankles if you're trail running.
6,2019-05-28,[''],love it.
7,2019-05-26,['hiking'],"No snow all the way to the top of black mountain, no spikes needed. The trail says 11+ miles but that's only if you go down the backside of the mountain down to the city creek trail, which would also double the elevation profile. We recorded about 4.5 miles and 3000 feet of elevation out. It's some nice rolling hills until about 2.5-3 miles out and then it's straight up about 1000 feet in .75 miles and then it's a relatively steady incline again but the trail conditions get less runnable. The last stretch to the summit is a scramble."
8,2019-05-15,['hiking'],"Trail is in fantastic condition. 

*As you approach the peak (roughly 100 yards away), you will hit the portion with shear drops on both sides. The easiest way to peak is go directly down to the right so you're below the drop, hug the rock wall as you hike forward, and you will end up on the ridge right behind the peak (about 25 yards away).
"
9,2019-05-11,"['hiking', 'no shade']",Very pretty trail. A butt kicker. Very steep. Great views. Awesome when you get up on the ridge line before the peak. Rather dangerous right before the peak a shear drop off on both sides. Wouldn’t recommend actually going to the peak because of this.
10,2019-05-06,['hiking'],"Did this trail for the first time as a solo trail run this morning.  All I can say is I think I will become along time customer and advocate of this trail.  AMAZING!  Definitely Hard.  Especially climbs once you get past the Avenues Twin Peaks very quickly.  The views are amazing.  I was one a time crunch and with the amount of snow on the Little Black ridge I was not able to make it all the way to the top before I had to turn around and head to work. Topped out about 7900 altitude.  Defnitely still some significant snow above 7500 ft or so. STEEP up there too. But not very exposed.  One of those epic runs and hikes when you see Coyotes, Deer, Wild Turkeys and just beatiful weather and views in all directions.   This one is probably always awesome in Spring or Fall.  The lower portion I am sure is hot and brown during the height of Summer but everything is green as can be right now.  GO IF YOU CAN THESE NEXT FEW WEEKS!"
11,2019-05-01,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful trail with views of SLC, Salt Lake and the mountains. The first 3 miles are relatively easy mostly along the Bonneville Shoreline Trail. After that is a tough incline for about 0.6 miles, followed by a walk along the ridge line.

The last 100 yards have a bunch of bouldering along some steep heights. As of May 1st, there’s still a bunch of snow up there making it tough. I stopped on the last peak before the final one for safety reasons. 

Going up, I kept thinking I was reaching the peak only to see another, higher peak. Great trail, but plan 5-6 hours to make it to the highest peak - and more if you want to do the entire trail to city creek."
12,2018-11-26,['hiking'],Did 9 miles of this trail today and then the steepness and the snow forced me to quit. Snowshoes rather than microspikes are needed for the last 2 miles. Gorgeous day for hiking though!
13,2018-10-08,['hiking'],"Wow! This certainly doesn't get the respect and attention it deserves. 


Took the dogs with me and had to rope them off on a tree about 1/3 mile from the Summit as it required some bouldering and scrambling. 

I absolutely loved the rolling hills and the views of Salt Lake Valley. 

The class 2 scrambling at the end is a nice beginner's challenge to rock climbing. 

:-)"
14,2018-08-17,['hiking'],"Good option for a challenging hike that doesn't require a drive up a canyon. I clocked about 3,000 ft. elevation gain and 8 miles round trip using Strava, and that was going past what is described as the little black mountain peak to almost the end of the bigger peak, so I'm not sure how why the stats on this say 11.5 miles and 4685 ft. Took me nearly 4 hours total with about 10 minutes at the top, stopping to take pictures and breathe a lot in the second half. The steep section is definitely a doozy, but luckily the majority of the trail is moderate. Great sunset views coming down in the evening, and it is awesome to be able to see so far in any direction! As far as wildlife goes, I did see some deer at the top and there were plenty of crickets to disturb along the path."
15,2018-06-24,[''],"Great hike, quite challenging in the last 1/3 part with some steep incline, sliding rocks, and a bit of rock climbing in the end. 3000ft elevation, took 4 hours both ways incl 30 min on the top. Very exposed, bring lots of water. Amazingly beautiful panoramic views."
16,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! Extremely beautiful all the way up. The hike is even better if you can find the time capsule up at the top, and the added bonus if you know how to find the smugglers gap trail that leads down the back side of the trail."
17,2018-06-03,[''],"Easy hike the majority of the way, but the last part will get you breathing heavy. Overall a gorgeous hike! I thought the trail was in great condition for being ""less traveled."""
18,2018-04-30,['hiking'],"This hike was so awesome!! I took my dog up to the top of on Saturday (4/28/18). Took us a total of about 5.5 hrs, with picture & lunch time @ the top. The climb up towards the end was steep and gets your legs burning but the views at the top were so rewarding!!"
19,2017-10-04,['hiking'],"This trail was amazing!! it gets very steep toward the end, but the view is worth it!!! it took me 3 hours total, with a lot of time for pics"
20,2017-10-01,['hiking'],"It's not ""Little"" Black Moutain. It's just BLACK MOUNTAIN. There is no such thing as ""Big Black Mountain"" either, a name commonly being used to refer to Burro Peak, the peak west of Grandview. The correct names are ""Black Mountain"" and ""Burro"", since the 1800s."
21,2017-09-03,[''],Challenging but rewarding hike with a nice scramble on top. You can out and back it or drop back down through City Creek Canyon. Very runnable minus a couple steep climbs.
22,2017-09-03,[''],I like this trail because it's largely runnable until the final climb up Little Black (then it's a great leg-burner). Wonderful 360 degree panoramic view from the top. I've run the Wasatch 100 and you can see from Francis Peak (mile 14) to Point Supreme (Sunset Peak above Brighton mile 78). Did it mid-day and it was unrelentingly exposed & hot - needed lots of water.
23,2017-07-22,['hiking'],"Tough hike. 3,000'"
24,2017-06-26,[''],"Definity an awsome view, a great place to watch the sunset. The beging of the hime is very easy, but the last mile or so will kick any experianced hiker, with lots of small rocks, making paths slippery and difficult with the steep incline. When you get to the peak, however, you feel like nothing can challenge you anymore. There is little to no tree coverage, so in summer it will be a hot hike, best done in spring or fall due to constant exposure to the sun."
25,2017-05-31,[''],"Good hike through rolling hills, descent incline, boulder scramble at the top without clear path to the very summit. Would have made the bushwack, but spotted a sizable rattler cosied up in the brush. Decided since I was alone, it would be better to enjoy the 90%. Lots of little lizards, butterflies and even spotted a few horney toads."
26,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"Nice hike and really not too hard until you hit the base of Little Black Mountain.  It will kick your butt, especially if it's the first hike of the season for you."
27,2017-05-22,['hiking'],Great spring trail. It is a leg workout. We did 8 miles round trip. The flowers are out and the views are awesome. We trail ran part of back.
28,2017-05-07,['hiking'],"Hard to follow beyond summit and find trail to city creek.  Minimal snow, some fun snowfields at the top.  Storm came in lightening wasn't too close.  Absolutely amazing views! Some steps too big for the dog without bushwhacking."
29,2017-05-02,[''],"Gorgeous hike! Rolling green hills, hiking along the rolling ridge with stunning canyons on both sides. Great running trail too. Once you get to the actual mountain (about 3 miles in), the hike up is steep and pretty brutal, but totally worth it. There is snow at the very top still, some steps coming up to my knees, but I never needed to put on micro spikes."
30,2017-04-30,[''],"Obviously you don't have to go all the way to the river and can turn back at the summit, which will cut about 2 miles. There are many false summits! The one that is visible from Avenues twin peaks is the first false summit. If you decide to stop there, you'll save another 2 miles. The ridge to the actual summit is a bit rocky and I had to deal with tons of unexpected snow.

Overall it's a beautiful hike!"
31,2017-04-23,['hiking'],One of the best spring hikes for endless views. There are a few points where it gets steep but no rock scrambling. Overall the trail is well defined. Wear sunscreen and enjoy the climb.
32,2017-04-10,['hiking'],
33,2016-11-01,['hiking'],"This is a fantastic and relatively long hike. I started from my housing near The Pie Pizzeria by the University and took a trailhead north of Virginia Street. It ended up being 12.8 miles out and back. 3 hours up; 2.5 hours back. (The trail itself is 9.4 miles out and back from the trailhead I chose.) Awesome views all along the way. The first several miles are gradual and well-trafficked. Then there is quite a climb section once you reach Little Black Mountain proper. The scramble at the top deterred me from reaching the absolute summit - I don't think scrambling on a solo hike is always the best idea - but the views in all directions are pretty spectacular and diverse: the Salt Lakes, downtown, the Wasatch. A little windy and chilly on top, especially if you sit still for too long. Coming back down there were long stretches that were runnable. All in all a rewarding and beautiful way to spend the day!"
34,2016-01-31,['snowshoeing'],I hiked this trail on snowshoes last winter to just before the climb gets steepest. Great views and a fun trail to snowshoe. Like to hike it again in summer
