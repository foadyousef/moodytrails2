0,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']","One of my favorite places to hike with my dog. I hike here year round. Usually not very crowded. There are lots of different paths you can take so it never gets old. I often see wildlife up here (deer, rabbits, snakes, etc.). The trail is fairly steep and can be very tiring to climb. It’s a gravely trail and can be slick at times. Wouldn’t recommend for small children. Part of the hike is shaded. Great view at the top. "
1,2019-08-31,['hiking'],"Exploring some of the Everest Ridge. Definitely uncomfortable in the summer heat, lots of sticky seed long pants are a must, fall would be better, I want to get all the way up to Timpanogos. My ending point was just west of the ridge you should be on."
2,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'rocky']",I didn’t stay on Dry Canyon Trail so don’t follow my route but the first part of the trail is steep with horrible giant railroad ties attempting to be steps but are more of an obstacle! It’s a very steady climb from them up to where it splits off towards little baldy which is the route I took! Definitely will be back to hike up to big baldy! Great views of Provo/Orem! Watch out for bees there is a lot of them and yes I got stung!

4,2019-06-15,['hiking'],This trails is fairly steep and has very few short level sections. The trails is easy to follow and well used

6,2019-04-27,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Unsuccessful Dry Canyon hike today....1.8 miles into the hike the trail turned into a small creek which just wasnt a great setup for my breathable running shoes.  After traversing the sides of the trail and leap frogging for another 0.5 miles trying to stay dry decided to call it when I slipped on a wet rock and ate it into the trail bank.  Lovely hike with some wildlife, but one I'll have to do again a bit later in the year and not on a rainy day.  Oh, and in case you haven't read the other reviews this one is a very steady climb.  I wasnt able to run the whole time as I have many trails at this trailhead as this one rarely flattened out."

8,2018-09-22,['horseback riding'],Went horseback riding on trails and gravel roads (?) in Dry Canyon area. Went up the Dry Canyon trail through the cliffs then north on the Curly Springs trail. Heavily used area. Really rocky/gravel/shale covered trails in many areas. Lots of side trails created by mountain bikers. Once out of the cliff area its mostly oak brush with nice views into valley and up canyon towards Mt Timpanogos but I never quite feel like I've left the urban area. Limited shade w/85% exposure to sun. Ok trails if you're looking for a quick get away but nothing worth making a long trip to get here. Typical of Wasatch front foothills scenery.
9,2018-08-06,['hiking'],"I did this trail on Mother’s Day 2018. It was my first hike of the season and first hike since I was a teenager.

It was nice. The trail was kind of worn out as you approached the saddle. Overall a nice hike that got me hooked!"
10,2018-07-07,['hiking'],Definitely a hard hike. The views are pretty good but not worth the trek. There is practically no shade at some points in the hike. Bring extra water on sunny days.
11,2018-07-02,[''],We didn’t go all the way up but lots of shade from scrub oak trees
12,2018-06-02,[''],The directions on the app are incorrect. You need to go east on 200 South in Lindon then turn left on Dry Canyon Drive.
13,2018-05-29,[''],"It’s definitely a difficult hike, but once you get about a half mile in, it gets easier."
14,2018-05-20,['hiking'],"Holy elevation gain, Batman! You’ll go up, up, and up for awhile on these trails. You get well into the wilderness although civilization remains within view for most of the hikes. There are multiple trails here—some more treacherous and rewarding than others—and there aren’t many folks. You could spend all day here weaving your way through and around the canyon. Watch out for rattlesnakes—they hang out here! Don’t be fooled by the residential location. These trails are legit and the payoff in views is worth it."
15,2018-04-20,[''],Great view
16,2018-04-01,[''],The trail is bad
17,2017-12-27,[''],Great little hike.
18,2017-12-19,['hiking'],
19,2017-10-19,[''],loved it!
20,2017-09-17,[''],good steep hike. great view
21,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"great hike. firs half mile is strenuous to get up above the cliffs.  beyond that I suggest going northwest-ish another mile/ mile and a half to the Battle creek overlook.  Gorgeous views and frightening cliffs.  Also, if you do scale the immediate cliffs to the left of the trail up Dry Canyon--be aware of rattlesnakes.  Saw one today, chilling under its rock perch, see pics attached."
22,2017-05-31,['hiking'],"5.21.2017 | 10lb Backpack | Recommend: Trekking Poles

I didn't even know this canyon existed until I heard about it through word of mouth. My GSD and I were happy to explore it even though it's strenuous! 

As previous people have said, there's a North fork and a South fork (no signage, you just have to notice it when you get there). I forked North on a rainy Sunday afternoon and met 3-4 people on the trail. There were plenty of deer out and saw quite a few birds as well. There are many criss-cross trails to explore and a great one toward the beginning that leads across the cliff to a beautiful valley overlook.

As you might expect, the most rewarding part is reaching the top and standing in awe of Timp. At this point you can make your hike as long or as short as you want to by continuing to follow trails at the top or turning back. I would recommend poles on the way down, especially if it's raining since it gets slick!

This is a canyon I can't stop thinking about and will return to for further exploration and peaceful enjoyment."
23,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"Great views, you don't even need to hike super far for them. There's a nice side trail that loops back on top of the ridge with a stunning view of the valley."
24,2017-05-20,[''],"If a 3 year old can do this trail, you can do it. She loved it, so did her 5 year old brother. Great hike saw a lot of deer and some bear tracks just past the cliffs to the left of the trail head sign."
25,2017-03-19,[''],"Perfect time of year for this hike, recommend Sunday's as no ones out!"
26,2016-11-07,[''],cool views. constantly climbing but not  the worst.
27,2016-11-02,[''],"Deceptively difficult, this is not a ""moderate hike."" If you follow the path outlined, you can go one of two ways, neither of which is easy.

Taking the south fork up, your path will be less steep to the summit of Big Baldy, but the way down will be very very steep. We had to go down backwards, nearly climbing, using our hands for support. The path down to the west from the summit is extremely steep, with loose dusty gravel and rocks. It's doable, but slow.

Going up the north fork will be an extremely steep ascent, but the descent will be a lot safer. However, that path is more in the shade, so will be cooler and get dark earlier.

In any case, this is one of the more difficult, frustrating hikes I've done, due to the long descent, loose rocky trail conditions, and steep grade coming down. Some awesome views all around, but not one I would do again soon."
28,2016-08-29,['hiking'],good for camping
29,2016-08-19,['hiking'],"This hike needs to be considered as hard because it was a very difficult hike to climb, but for those who want to hike Dry Canyon need to pack A LOT of water especially if your bringing your dog because they need water as much as you do. As for little dogs if they're having a difficult time walking bring a backpack big enough to carry your dog. Keep your phones fully charged in case of emergency. Just be safe out there guys."
30,2016-06-24,['hiking'],I love this trail because it takes you right under Mt. Timp and the views are amazing. It's a beautiful little canyon and the hike is medium difficulty for a day hike
31,2016-06-17,['backpacking'],"Not as easy as I thought it would be but camping in Hidden Valley is incredible. It's amazing how it just turns into a flat, grassy valley in the midst of the mountain."
32,2016-05-31,['hiking'],So... According to my iPhone's health app we went 9.29 miles by staying on this trail... I'm out of shape obviously. This took us more than 4 hours to complete. It is really steep for over a mile. This is definitely NOT EASY...
33,2016-05-13,['hiking'],Beautiful views. Harder than Squaw Peak.
34,2016-04-21,[''],"I LOVE this hike. It is a little more difficult, mostly because there is an incline 90% of the way that sometimes gets a little more intense. It is a little dangerous, since you are hiking to the top of a cliff, so taking dogs or small children might not be the best idea unless you plan to carefully watch their every move. It's a beautiful hike at night as well, because once you are on top of the cliffs, you can see much of Utah valley!! I go on this hike lots during the summer! It's a good workout!"
35,2016-04-19,['hiking'],"It was really hard and steep. Not ""easy"" as rated by app"
36,2016-03-10,[''],love this trail and area.
37,2015-07-09,['walking'],Beautiful hike.
38,2015-07-06,['hiking'],"Love this place, I would give this 5 stars but gave 4 stars. Because, I hate/scared of snakes and you'll see about 2-4 ft snakes if you go their often. I live less than 5 min drive away from the canyon and hike up to the peaks aka Great Blue Gate often or run south along the Bonneville Shoreline trail. Anyways, short hikes in Dry canyon are mostly steep but not too bad just take some water. But if you go farther make sure to pack more water and some snacks. I've seen deer, snake, wild rabbit, different types of birds and pretty butterflies, etc. Maybe it depends on the time of the day and season whether you see wildlife or not, don't know :)"
39,2015-05-24,['hiking'],This trail is very steep right out of the get go. Very pretty scenery. Almost got rained on today! I would recommend it but not for beginners. Bring plenty of water on this trail.
40,2015-05-08,['hiking'],"It is a decent hike. There is even some climbing to be done in it, though the routes are very chossy. It is nice because it is close, but it is not a destination. I would mostly go there if I was wanting a quick hike that could provide some good exercise and scenery. Like most hikes is Utah County, it can be a bit steep at times."
41,2015-01-26,['hiking'],"Just finished the hike today (late January). Still plenty of snow up there, but packed down so showshoes aren't required, just some waterproof boots. Got some great views of Timpanogos, Cascade, and even Nebo in the distance. Didn't see another body out there with us, and the dog loved running around in some of the open spaces. Be familiar with the area, and take a map. The road ""more traveled"" wasn't actually the trail and catches trail 51 later which runs back around Little Baldy. No water and a few steep climbs but overall was a light-moderate hike. Not the best in the area, but definitely worth doing!"
42,2014-12-21,['hiking'],"Great hike. Take water, Forget your Mountain Bike, the trail is too steep."
43,2014-10-16,['hiking'],"Steep rocky trail. Scrub oak and virtually no wildlife. Great view from Baldy, but I dont anticipate doing this one again."
44,2014-09-05,['hiking'],Beautiful hike!
45,2014-05-27,['hiking'],"Took this trail up for a mid-day summit of Big Baldy. It is pretty steep in places, but very well maintained and never difficult to follow whatsoever. Dry Canyon lives up to its reputation, no water, so be sure to bring plenty with you. I've done a lot of hikes in the Wasatch, and this one has views that are every bit as good as many others, and from the summit? Spectacular! Descended the South Ridge, be warned, that path is very steep and in places extremely steep, not for the meek going up or down! I plan on returning sometime soon to hike to the saddle, and then descending back through Battle Creek."
46,2013-08-27,['hiking'],"Steep climb for first 1/2 mile. As the trail progresses, the scenery gets progressively more beautiful. First and last .2 mile has fantastic views of Utah Valley. Hiked this quick loop during lunch. after a 1/2 mile there are trails that lead further into the mountains. The track for the loop is here... http://alltrails.com/tracks/dry-canyon-trail"
47,2013-08-21,['hiking'],"Went up to summit Big Baldy. The trail starts steep, has a fairly mild mid section, and then really cranks up for the last mile or so to the fork. Don't plan on any available water so pack plenty. We hiked up at night under a full moon using no headlamps because it was so bright. Had no problems following the trail because it is so well marked and kept. About half a mile after the turn you can take for little baldy there is a great spot to hammok or set base camp for the short run to the summit (seriously like 0.5 miles from the fork) if you plan on overnighting. This spot has a three way split, one to the summit of big baldy (INCREDIBLE VIEW of the valley), one to the battle creek trail (which will loop all the way down to that trailhead), or back to the dry canyon trail which is what we did. My phone died after we set base, but after consolidation we totaled 7 miles (with a slight jog to quigly springs), and our descent time was 1 hour 10 minutes. There are many spots to pull out and set camp if you need, the trail is fairly steep overall. There were not a lot of bugs and no wildlife was seen except for a 4 foot snake on the summit in the morning sun. The meadows are super cool looking and the views are great. :) "
