0,2019-07-02,"['trail running', 'snow']",Ran/hiked this trail Saturday. Still snow covered shortly after Box Elder trail split about 3.3 miles up from parking lot. Didn’t bring my running spikes but was still able to make to the saddle looking down on Tibble Fork. Trail up north ridge to Box Elder summit skill snow covered but ran into two others who ran that 2 mile stretch up and over to south side and returned on Box Elder trail (2 miles) where it ties back into Dry Creek trail. They made it without spikes! Another couple weeks and snow will be gone. Unreal views all around!
1,2019-06-29,"['backpacking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","We got about 3 miles up the trail today. I just need to point out that this is not starting at granite flats camp ground like one post states. It is in alpine. It's so steep and rocky. There are many people on the trail until you get to the horse tail falls turn off. Part of the trail is river but there are log crossings available for the most part. After the turn off it's pretty low traffic, but the trail is a creek bed. It's rocky, steep and slippery. We carried our packs to camp out one night but we left too late to get more of the hike in that we wanted to. I'm sure it would have paid off with the views. It's great walking next to the river and seeing the falls from the trail. There are great views of the mountains and the city. Camping is hard to find but there are sites. "
2,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']",Made it about 2/3 to 3/4 of the way but stopped due to the snow preventing us from following the remainder of the trail since we haven't done it before we turned around. The waterfall was tricky to find and luckily fellow hikers guided us to a dropoff trail to the left about two miles in. It took us about an hour to get to the waterfall. Trail is wet and muddy from snow melt now. Definitely wear waterproof hiking boots if possible.
3,2019-05-11,['hiking'],Didn’t quite make it to the falls this time. Very busy trail.
4,2019-02-23,"['snowshoeing', 'snow']","First on on the trail after horsetail falls after the recent snowstorms. Great snowshoeing and beautiful views. The snow was lite and fluffy. Long, hard and rewarding day. Was able to stay near the trail using the default recording"
5,2018-11-21,['hiking'],"Rated appropriately for the level, took around 3.5 hours however we stopped to take a lot of photos and take in the view.  Dead horse is still on the left of the trail near the wood post for the 046 trail.  It did not smell and is half buried so you may miss it (my dog easily found it with his nose so watch out if you're with pups!).  Trail was clear with the exception of  an ice slick about 1/4 mi past the first meadow.  I was able to easily navigate around this in the brush and avoid slipping.  This trail shares the majority of the way to Horsetail Falls so check that out as a nice pit stop (also found on All Trails)."
6,2018-11-12,['hiking'],"The first half of the trail or so is the same as Box Elder Peak. 

Start out at Granite Flat Campground and make your way up Deer Creek Trail. 

Once you reach the saddle, head west and follow the ridge line up to the saddle. 

There is one precarious spot where you will need to watch your footing."
7,2018-08-26,['hiking'],"4 stars because of the killer views at the top but 3 stars for the hike itself. Follows a dry creek all the way up, so very few switchbacks as you climb. Watch the trail after the Dry Creek / Box Elder intersection. Not too far up from that intersection  the trail is blocked by a fallen tree and you have to go around. You can pick the trail up but make sure you hang to the right when you come upon a slight Y in the trail. The trail to the right is over grown with tall grass but once you get through that then you’ll be golden. If you’re making your way through lots of overgrown bushes then you may want to check your map (speaking from experience here). Several streams for dogs to cool their paws because of yesterday’s rain."
8,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"This trail was very challenging because of how steep it was. There are lots of rocks and boulders, and you go over a couple of streams, walking on logs. Lots of shade, which was nice. Very good exercise, but I felt that the moderate rating should be more like moderate+, though I saw a lot of children on the trail. 

Horses and dogs are allowed on the trail, so there is quite a bit of horse manure and the occasion dog pile you must avoid. We ended up not doing the entire trail, but instead turned off about half way up to go see the falls. That made the difficult hike worth it. Very beautiful and refreshing. 

WARNING: When we reached the waterfall, we saw a young man lying at the base of it, badly hurt. He had fallen from the top of the waterfall (about 60+ feet). He had to be life-flighted out. I tried to get where he was, to help the others who were helping him, as I am trained in first aid/cpr, but the rocks were very, very slippery, even when dry. Please be careful if you venture to the actual falls. 

All in all, a nice hike, especially if you want a good work out. The round trip from the falls is about 2.5-3 hours."
9,2018-08-15,[''],"decent quick hike.  hiked in,  had lunch and enjoyed the falls. easy trail with a little elevation. saw toddlers having no issue."
10,2018-06-14,['hiking'],"Should have came earlier, but had enough water for both of us and dogs. This is more of a moderate 1/2 then moderate. Glad for the shade, and for a couple that was coming down told us of a nice place above the falls."
11,2018-06-02,['hiking'],"Two stars for the trail and five stars for the view at the top. The trail is extremely rocky (you hike in a dry creek, not next to it). There is still a very smelly dead horse about 3/4 mi up the trail, as well as a smelly dead deer with a thousand flies eating it about 7/8 of the way up the trail. Beware if you have a dog. The higher up you get the more open and beautiful the scenery becomes. The meadow at the top is lovely with amazing views of the surrounding mountains. There was a little snow the last 1/4 mile, but you can skirt around it if you want. My puppy had a blast playing in it."
12,2018-05-28,['hiking'],This trail is hard hike up. Beautiful trail.
13,2018-05-26,[''],Steep and yes dry at the bottom.  But get up higher and you get into lusher vegetation.  Great to explore around the falls.  I’ve done this many times hiking and even on my mountain bike.  Fun hike with a friend.
14,2017-07-30,[''],Dead horse on the trail about half mile in
15,2017-07-15,[''],Very beautiful!
16,2017-07-03,[''],"Great hike! Ended up taking the trail over the saddle and down through Granite Flat to Tibble Fork. Lots of wildflowers, very lush and beautiful."
17,2017-04-04,['trail running'],"Condition report: the trail has only a few small patches of packed snow up to the  7200 ft elevation level (near the upper turnoff to the falls). Above that it's a 50/50 mix of packed snow and muddy trail. At 7600 ft the mud ended and it turned into a snowfield, but that's also where the boot track ended and the snow got soft. I didn't go up any further."
18,2017-02-01,['hiking'],"Passed a lot of trail riders with their horses on this trail, 
growing up with horses this did not bother me at all. 
I passed just a few other hikers mainly lower down by the head of the trail. Came a crossed a girl a few miles up closer to where you could see the falls who was also wondering how to actually get to the falls.
​ The picture I took from the distance dose not do justice to them and I still wish I could have reached them."
19,2017-01-21,['snowshoeing'],"Great Trail that easy to follow in several feet of powder. It was a banner week for snow on this trail. We were breaking trail in mid thigh deep snow. It was amazing. Snowed the entire time so were were not able to see anything because of the low ceiling. Wanted to get up to the summit but breaking trail with that slowed us down and was too tiring and ran out of time. Can't wait to try this trail in the summer and go all the way to Box Elder Peak. Go very early or late. There were over 100 people carrying sleds, disks etc planning on sliding down. Glad we were going down while they were all still going up. It wouldn't be fun dodging sleds on snowshoes going up."
20,2016-10-30,['hiking'],"Just completed this today with the whole family. Packed up our toddlers on our backs and our older kids, 9 and 10 years old, did great! The trail is rocky but a nice steady incline. Not too slippery for us. You cross a small stream towards the top and we kept mostly to the left. We went off to the left and stopped at the lookout at the end of the hike and you get a great view of Horsetail Falls. Nice views, saw a group on horses on the way. Perfect Saturday getaway!"
21,2016-09-22,[''],very nice . a lot of exposure.  bring extra water. somewhat steep and rocky so nice
22,2016-09-01,['hiking'],Saw a lot of reviews to stay on the left side of the creek so that's what we did. BE ADVISED if you take this trail to it's end you will run into a dropoff over looking one of the waterfalls. You can climb the big rock formation for a slight view of both waterfalls and the canyon. the left side is definitely more scenic but I believe if you're wanting to get up close and personal you should stick to the right side trail.
23,2016-08-22,[''],my wife and I did this hike with 2 little dogs on leashes.  we won't do that again. as others have mentioned...it is rocky and slippery at times. trails are not marked well. the only downside.. we will come back. lots of deer in and around the trail
24,2016-08-21,['hiking'],Beautiful trail! A little slippery though.
25,2016-08-19,['camping'],"Didn't go on the actual Dry Creek trail, but followed the river up the mountain. My dogs loved the water and the scenery was awesome. It looks like there are lots of nice places to camp by the river, but no fires allowed."
26,2016-08-06,[''],"Took 4 teenagers with me and we did just fine. Lots of shade, loose dirt and rocks. Slippery in spots. Trail is not marked well, just stay to the left. To the falls and back is 6+ miles total."
27,2016-07-21,[''],"Loved the views! Packed a 1yo and a 3yo in with my husband. The trail is a little confusing when you get to the fork. Take the left and just after, there's a little deer trail right to a good spot to look at the falls. We went left, hiked up too high, then had to scale down back to the plateau"
28,2016-07-17,[''],Nice hike and really accessible. Definitely a good workout for us. It was about 2.1 miles to the actual Falls. Gorgeous views and lots of shade. Pretty steep and slippery at times. Not for little kids. I would say age 10+..
29,2016-07-12,['hiking'],We liked how quickly we were into the pines.
30,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"Part shaded, beautiful scenery, an amazing views of the falls. When you hit the sign about 20 feet from it on the left is the trail to the actual falls. If you have dogs be careful they don't get swept away by the water, it's a fast current."
31,2016-07-08,['hiking'],Very nice hike. Not too busy and enough shade to make a July outing enjoyable.
32,2016-06-23,['hiking'],Awesome hike. If you go all the way up to the falls it's about 2.5 miles- and very steep the last mile or so. But it's worth it. The view is awesome and the falls are big and very pretty!
33,2016-06-12,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. The falls are bigger then I expected. Loved the view of Alpine Valley hiking back.
34,2016-06-11,[''],"Beautiful greenery. A lot of the hike was shaded, though a little steeper than I had imagined. Dog friendly! Most people had their dogs off lease which I liked. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because horses do use this trail, and of course there were large amounts of poop all throughout the trail. Which became stinky and unattractive."
35,2016-06-08,[''],Awesome hike and good workout since it was all up hill going up. There's a lot of snowmelt right now causing you to have go through a couple runoff streams. Either wear water proof shoes  or be willing to take off your boots and socks to walk through like what I did. It's cold water but felt good!
36,2016-06-04,[''],"Beautiful. A little crowded, but the smells, the sounds, and the rugged beauty was breathtaking."
37,2016-06-02,[''],great hike!
38,2016-05-30,[''],This was a nice hike but not something I would do with kids.  This was a steep the whole way there over mostly rocks
39,2016-05-19,['hiking'],Spectacular falls!  Shaded trail and sounds of the flowing creek is so refreshing!  Worth the views at the top of the falls!
40,2016-05-14,[''],Dry:)
41,2016-05-03,[''],It's a really nice and easy hike for a beginner like me! Kicked my booty still but awesome scenery and definitely worth it!!
42,2016-04-03,[''],"A little steep, but keep going! The view at the end is worth it. Highly recommended!"
43,2016-03-12,['hiking'],Kids and I always enjoy this hike. It is by far one of their favorites
44,2016-01-04,[''],I prefer this trail to the other trail to ponytail falls. You can't see the falls but the trail is not as rocky and primarily shaded. Watch for rattlesnakes!
45,2015-11-29,['hiking'],"Did it in the snow in late November, which I actually enjoyed. Make sure you have snow boots/shoes. Took me about 2 1/2 hours total, including a couple of 5-minute stops. On the way back down, it was still snowing but the sun was out and some spots on the trail looked downright magical. The largest stream crossing (there are 4 or 5, all very small besides this one) was a bit precarious because the logs to cross on were snowy and slick and there was a thin ice layer resting on top of the water--just enough to step on and quickly get across."
46,2015-11-07,[''],"Very pretty. Pretty rocky trail especially when you get up higher, but well worth the climb."
47,2015-09-05,['hiking'],"Fairly decent and strenuous hike.  Tough at points due to the many rocks exposed. I'd recommend going when there is more water at the falls, but still refreshing to finish the climb."
48,2015-08-23,['hiking'],"Beautiful views, nice trail. I really enjoyed this hike."
49,2015-08-16,['hiking'],"We did this hike with our smallish dog and we all loved it, especially getting to the water pools/waterfalls at the top, which were very refreshing after the fairly steep up hill hike in the hot sun. The first maybe quarter of the trail and the last quarter are pretty sunny but in the middle there's lots of trees."
50,2015-08-15,[''],08/15/2015 - Saturday- the trail is essentially a dry creek bed so you are walking amongst river Rock most of the time. It's a steady incline the whole way. I continued past the falls for a couple of miles through the aspens. Lots of side trails. No real pay-off but lots of solitude.
51,2015-08-15,['hiking'],"Missed the turnoff and never found the falls. There are many parallel paths and they are not well marked. Ended up on top of the ridge. Very steep and rocky. Very slippery on the way down.
I may go back in the spring when there is more water."
52,2015-07-10,['bird watching'],"Loved it!   Good trail very family friendly , 
Nice falls and splash pools, the water now Is clear and cold , real refreshing !!"
53,2015-06-27,[''],"A somewhat steep hike, but not too long. Probably took me almost an hour and a half up, and half that time down. A little confused at where to go once you are almost there. There is a sign at a fork in the trail. The right goes further up the mountain, while the left is to the Horsetail Falls. The falls are gorgeous."
54,2015-05-24,[''],"This was a nice moderate hike up the canyon. Lots of rocks along the trail, and a few downed trees to navigate. The falls are pretty, and the quiet scenery makes for a peaceful day."
55,2014-05-19,['hiking'],Trail No. 43 (aka Dry Creek Trail and Deer Creek Trail) trail heads on the east side of it in the Unitas National Forest. That's where I started and it was a great day. On the south side of the trail there are moose to be found throughout what is called the Moose Ponds. I went up to about 9400' and turned back due to trail being snow covered below a waterfall with no way of determining how solid or deep the snow was.
