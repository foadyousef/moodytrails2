1,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, not too steep, a long hike, but a gentle incline and such beautiful scenery! Saw two moose, the lake was stunning, there were lots of bikers on the trail but not too many to enjoy some time in the quiet of nature, and the bikers were polite. I can’t wait to do this one again."
2,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"What s beautiful trail! Saw three bull moose about 0.5 mile away from the split to dog lake, that was both concerning and exciting. They were roughly 30 yards off the trail, kept to themselves (thankfully). Many deer as well. Def going to return"
3,2019-09-02,['hiking'],I love this hike. It is beautiful the entire way up. The lake is so colorful. Enjoy!
4,2019-09-01,['hiking'],09/01/2019 -- Great hike! Not too steep. Just a little under 8 miles out and back. Took us 3 hr 15 min total excluding breaks.
5,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Super pretty hike. From the lake, it's a short additional hike up to the peak, where there are spectacular views. I hiked a few more hours along the ridge towards Guardsman Pass - really beautiful. Lots of vegetation lower down, but no problem with bugs with bug spray on."
6,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"Good trail to build some endurance on. The lake isn't as spectacular as others, but it was a really nice solo morning hike. Car to car was 9:40-12:20. "
7,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"Always wanted to do this hike, finally finished! I likd that it isn't too steep but a longer trail. Started about 7:45am and nice and cool. Finished 11:45am."
8,2019-08-11,['hiking'],Trail in great condition. It’s a nice steady climb not too steep but a good workout.  Watch out for the mountain bikers and enjoy the view of the lake. Trail has a mix of sun and shade but in the heat went thru 2 liters of water.

10,2019-08-09,['hiking'],Hiked this trail back in June and there was still snow. Would love to give it another hike now that all the snow should be gone. 
11,2019-08-08,"['hiking', 'over grown']","Great hike today, perfect weather. I cant believe how full and lush the area is. Lots of wildflowers, some has died out but lots still in good shape. Especially a little bit above the lake. Trail was dry, no bugs, lots of deer. "
12,2019-08-02,['hiking'],"Backpacking this trail was a good challenge for my husband, 12 year old son and myself. The trail is sunny much of the way, and buggy where it runs along the stream but it’s totally worth it. Lake was beautiful, wildlflowers were beautiful, as was the ridge line we hiked up next day. Quite a few nice campsites, also a trail to a nice spring as you get close to the lake, maybe 3.5 miles in (before a steep wooded bit). One of my favorites in this canyon! "
13,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Love this hike.  Bugs are a little thick so don’t leave the spray behind.  I learned the hard way.  Saw ourselves a cow moose and a couple o’ deer.  Trail is in great shape.  
Lots of bikers and they were all courteous. Thanks guys. "
14,2019-07-23,['hiking'],This is a nice and easy trail that usually has other hikers. The river is nice to wade in after a hot day of trekking.
15,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"Loved it. Feels great to leave road behind so quickly and immediately be surrounded by trees. The lower portion of the trail is heavily trafficked, but we’ve always had the lake practically to ourselves. "
16,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"I was pretty surprised by how much I liked this trail. I don't generally care for anything on the Olympus side of the canyon and I chose this one because I didn't have much time so I needed something fairly short and easy. Short and easy it is, but with enough variations in the trail grade and surrounding scenery to keep it interesting. The lake itself wasn't my favorite but I think this would be a great place for an overnighter by virtue of the low traffic and abundant meadows at the top."
17,2019-07-21,['backpacking'],"This is a great trail! Very scenic, sunny and shade and not too steep of an incline. It was warm the whole time. Dry, not muddy. Lots of water available for filtering along the way. At the lake there’s barely any snow left, except a small patch covering the far side of the lake."
18,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']","i loved this hike, did it when it was snowy and just did it again! beautiful scenery, moderate traffic, a longer intermediate hike, and the lake was peaceful. did have some trouble getting around with a few moose first in a meadow where i waited to pass by and then they got into the lake as i was hiking around it. Can't fault wildlife for being themselves though, made it more of an adventure anyway. "
19,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"This is definitely, hands down my favorite hike. Done it a bunch of the years. Right now is especially beautiful. The wild flowers are amazing and there is SO MUCH GREEN!! You will not be disappointed. We camped up there last night and the bugs weren't bad. Definitely need bug spray though. This morning on the way out we saw 3 bull moose in a meadow near the lake. That was magical. I've never seen 3 moose together before!! "
20,2019-07-17,['hiking'],"4/5 if you just hike to the lake. However, it’s definitely a 5/5 if you take the extra mile and go up to the ridge line and some of the peaks. The view up there is tremendous!"
21,2019-07-16,['hiking'],Awesome hike! 
22,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Went up for a quick overnighter Saturday evening. A few people on the trail asked us about camp spots up there. There are some nice spots with fire pits all around the lake. If you’re staying overnight, I’d recommend looking around a bit further away from the lake to avoid the bugs and get away from the crowds. The trail is beautiful so get up and get out there. "
23,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"Great trail. Beautiful scenery, wildflowers.  
Definitely worth the hike! "
24,2019-07-09,['hiking'],"Beautiful lake and a good hike. It’s uphill but the incline isn’t super steep and the scenery is great the whole way as you hike through groves of aspen. It was a nice, quiet destination, especially after battling the crowds to Lake Blanche. "
25,2019-07-08,[''],"Great hike. Very easy to follow trail. Beautiful scenery. It isn’t terribly steep, but it’s definitely uphill almost the entire way. I was pretty tired by the time I got to the lake. Coming back down was super easy, though. Not steep enough to be too hard on your knees. "
26,2019-07-06,['hiking'],The trail is now accessible all the way to the lake. The lake is about as full and as emerald green as it’s going to get. Perfect time to hike it. 
27,2019-07-04,['hiking'],"Easy hike without anything steep.  Went to Desolation, walked all the way around and had 100 yds. of snow on the back side of the lake.  No big deal to navigate.  
Took the trail to Dog Lake, went around and then back to the parking lot.  
Trail is in great shape.
Just get out and hike!!!!!"
28,2019-06-28,['hiking'],"Trail is in great shape below the first Dog Lake cutoff, above that there was a couple sections where the trail was muddy but not too badly, and two snow patches that were easily crossed. Watch for a baby and mother moose! "
29,2019-06-21,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Trail was great for 90% of it. Decent amount of snow in some areas near the lake. Lake is still partially frozen. Keep hiking up Mill D North to Wasatch Crest and you get some of the most incredible views I’ve ever seen. Highly recommended! 
30,2019-06-19,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'snow']",hiked up to desolate and then dog. trail up was great.  snow makes the trail hard to follow the last quarter mile. we then hiked over to dog lake. the trail to it was nice but dog lake is meh compared to desolate. 
31,2019-06-17,[''],Great hike with some amazing views. 
32,2019-06-13,['hiking'],Great hike! 
33,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'snow']",Really cool and medium hard :) Cool :)
34,2019-06-10,['hiking'],This trail was awesome and beautiful!  It wasn’t very steep so moderate is a good rating.  The last 0.3 mile was snow and was so pretty!  The lake is still covered in ice and gorgeous!  I can’t wait to do it again!
35,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'snow']","Trail is in good shape but the last full about mile is snow covered (June 8, 2019).If you have good boots you'll be fine. We used spikes and it made life a lot easier.  Some sections of the trail a bit muddy. Overall a great hike as usual, just a little slow going on the snow. Bring your sunscreen, the reflection on the snow for the last bit burned my face pretty well. "
36,2019-06-01,"['hiking', 'snow']",One of my favorite. Ran into some fresh mountain lion or bear tracks about a quarter mile before the lake and turned around. Was getting rained on and had been trail blazing for a half mile. Good times!
37,2019-05-23,['hiking'],Love this trail. Snow starts pretty early in. Spikes could be useful but not necessary.
38,2019-05-18,['hiking'],"5.16.19– snow pack starts 1.4 miles in, used trail crampons and poles (helped) but still post holed and slid every now and then :). Only one other person on the trail in the evening, TONS of moose scat, rain and wind, sadly turned around a mile before the lake because a potential lightning storm was moving in. Safety third! "
39,2019-05-16,['hiking'],lots of snow as of 05/16/19. no bugs! :)
40,2019-05-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Fun hike in the summer. Wouldn’t recommend it during May. A lot of snow about half way up right now.
41,2019-02-23,"['hiking', 'snow']",Only needed spikes until the turnoff. Lost the trail a few times. Had to trailblaze to get to the lake and ran out of steam about a 3/4 mile away. Next time!
42,2019-02-23,"['snowshoeing', 'snow']","We snowshoed this trail on 2/18 and got nearly 3 miles up it before the snow depth and our lack of skill forced us to turn back. The trail was only visible for a bit past the junction with the Dog Lake Trail, and then was completely covered  in snow the rest of the way, so I wouldn’t recommend it unless you are very good with a topo map/have GPS. We didn’t need snow shoes until the junction. It was still worth going up and absolutely beautiful. Only saw one other person after the junction. Great area to go exploring and get some real snow shoeing in since so many other trails are packed down. Saw a lot of moose on the lower part of the trail."
43,2019-01-20,['hiking'],"Could not get all the way without snowshoes around 2pm on 1/20. I got as far as the junction for Dog with micros.  Beyond that was frustrating post hole madness. Turned around about .25-.5 miles from the junction. 

But.  It's beautiful and everything before the junction was easy."
44,2019-01-02,[''],"Hiked this on New year's day and it was great! Lots of fresh snow, but still not hard to find the trail to the lake. The first half (until the fork to Dog Lake) we carried snowshoes because boots were enough, after that (while not entirely necessary, some people only had microspikes) we were glad to have the snowshoes, it certainly made the trek easier!"
45,2018-12-09,['skiing'],"Skinned up to desolations and skied Powder Park. Snow was phenomenal up top. The further down you went the crustier it was. Beautiful trail, quite a bit of snow up there."
46,2018-12-03,['hiking'],hiked on 11-25. strapped on snow shoes about the dog lake turn off... beautiful this time of year!
47,2018-11-15,['hiking'],I hiked this on Tuesday.  The trail was quite muddy and slick.  The lake is frozen and covered in snow.  Beautiful little rainbows reflecting in the snowflakes.  I passed 5 people on the trail.  It took me 3.25 hours.
48,2018-11-06,[''],"This trail was amazing! 
made my legs burn but so worth it!"
49,2018-10-05,['hiking'],Awesome hike with beautiful views. Took us 3 hours and 15 minutes to go up and back. Pretty warm going up but glad we had layers going down. Passed 5 people the whole time and we started at 10 am.
50,2018-10-03,['hiking'],"Great hike.  We clocked it at 8.2 miles.  It's a nice gradual incline.  Falls colors were spectacular.  At the actual lake, most of the color was already dropped, but the lake itself is a gorgeous emerald green color.  On a Wednesday with a mid-morning start, we only saw one bike and 2 or 3 other hikers.  Do this one!"
51,2018-10-01,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail just this past Saturday, starting at 9 am, and it was one of the most colorful fall hikes I've ever been on. So gorgeous, especially starting out in the morning with fewer hikers. Now is the time to do this one! The trees at the lake are all gray but the entire way up is the main attraction. I encountered many bikers but all of them were pleasant. Spooked myself and thought I heard some growling about 1/3rd of the way up but on the way down I determined it to be some water pipes gurgling (it was right at the stream). Overall an amazing trail."
52,2018-09-28,['hiking'],"The trail is fine and as advertised but man someone is going to get hurt by the bikers if they haven't already.  About 10 or 12 went by me and only one announced themselves and stopped.  Of the others, 2 went by at top speed, head down, right in the middle of the trail, and I barely got out of the way.  The rest never slowed or announced but I heard them in plenty of time to step aside.  Good thing too or I'd be in the hospital right now."
53,2018-09-27,['hiking'],First time to the lake.  Wasn't too bad of an incline.  I've done worse.  The lake was a cool greenish color.  There weren't a lot of Aspen in the area that still had leaves on them.  There was a lot of color along the rest of the trail.  Heading down I came across a few deer (no bucks).
54,2018-09-25,['hiking'],I usually opt for hikes with peaks as the destination but this trail is a new favorite. We hiked up and back in about three hours with five to ten minutes at the lake. The trees are still changing so it's not too late to enjoy them.
55,2018-09-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike.  Steady incline, but not too bad.  My GPS clocked me at 8.0 miles round trip.  Took a total of 5 hrs (spent some time at the lake).  We missed most of the fall leaves, but the hike was still nice.  Ran into a few bikers and a hand full of trail runners.  No wildlife :("
56,2018-09-20,['trail running'],"Sunny trail. Beautiful scenery. The lake was beautiful, even if it was low. I would, however, say this trail is more than “lightly traveled”. On a Wednesday morning (around 10), I saw dozens of hikers and bikers."
57,2018-09-13,['trail running'],"I live in Layton, but I will drive 45 minutes for this hike. BeaUTAHful views all the way up, with not to many people on the trail. Clear trail but it is up hill most of the way. Very shady and nice and windy around this time. A few bikers so keep an eye out. I ran down today and it was glorious!!! The lake is amazing too."
58,2018-08-26,['hiking'],"Still pretty hot on the first part of the trail if you go midday, but the upper half is absolutely gorgeous! The lake is beautiful from this vantage point, though in a different way than from Beartrap Fork (a must-try)."
59,2018-08-17,[''],Great Hike go early gets a little warm this time of year.
60,2018-08-13,[''],"I have gone on this trail several times and each time, the  lake never disappoints. It is rather hilly but is a wonderful experience with amazing views of the mountains and some meadows! I would highly recommend it!"
61,2018-08-12,[''],This is one of my most favorite hikes.
62,2018-08-08,['hiking'],"The lake was really low and not too exciting. Seeing the lake at the end of Beartrap Fork is a better view. The best part of my hike was watching two bull moose eating about 8 feet away from the trail. A female moose was down below them keeping an eye on me and a buck was running around, probably away from me."
63,2018-07-30,['hiking'],"Great hike the day after upper Red Pine lakes. A bit easier, nevertheless, a challenging two days. Hope everyone’s okay on Red/White Pine. Cops had trailhead closed earlier today. We looped over to Dog Lake coming down & recommend the same."
64,2018-07-28,['hiking'],"A nice hike to a quiet lake. The trail itself is pleasant with a mixture of low, moderate, and steep inclines throughout. We were passed by 2 mountain bikers and several hikers coming up as we were descending. Definitely worth checking out."
65,2018-07-26,['hiking'],Hiked with my 9 year old.  Round trip in under 4 hours.  Highlight was seeing a water snake in the lake!
66,2018-07-25,['hiking'],"Really enjoyed the hike up! Super beautiful and a nice, strenuous hike without feeling like you’re going to die. For the return, we hiked up the crest and down bear trap. I did not enjoy the hike down. SUPER steep and loose rocks/dirt caused me to slip and fall several times. It was pretty, but I was so sick of how steep it was coming down that I barely noticed. It was also a mile and a half walk down big cottonwood back to the parking lot. I’d recommend going back down Mill D!"
67,2018-07-25,[''],Absolutely beautiful! Lake is well worth it but be prepared to have some sore legs.
68,2018-07-19,['hiking'],
69,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"This hike was the perfect challenge. 9 Miles RT and 2,500 elevation gain. It gradually climbed and was flat in some areas. Beautiful meadows and wildflowers everywhere. We hiked to desolation lake, up on top of the ridge and across.. I believe that’s the crest trail-and there’s beautiful views of park city on one side and desolation lake on the other side. We descended down bear trap fork. If you go early, you will see a ton of wildlife. We came across a bear going down bear trap right off the side of the trail(so be aware). This hike was amazing and we will be back!"
70,2018-07-11,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! Super green right now. Steady uphill but not bad. Also, almost no shade mid afternoon so take plenty of water to drink. Should also note that lake is part of watershed and violations, such as swimming or taking dogs, are a class b misdemeanor."
71,2018-07-10,['hiking'],"lots of mountain bikers but they were courteous and announced their presence. If you are up for it, hike past the lake up to the crest for a beautiful view"
72,2018-07-06,['backpacking'],"Started the trail around 5pm on July 3rd and parking was pretty empty. Long steady uphill all the way to the lake but not terribly strenuous. Lake was beautiful. Wildflowers in bloom all along the trail. Only wildlife we saw were a few deer. Spend the night there. Some great spots to camp that have been well established. Temperatures were perfect for hiking, but the night got pretty cool (high 40s). Next morning we left around 9am and got back to the parking lot by 10:30am. Several hikers celebrating Independence Day! As has been mentioned, this is a popular biking trail, so use caution. We even saw/heard bikers going down at midnight! Overall, great hike and one I'd definitely return to hike/bike again!"
73,2018-07-01,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! The wildflowers are still in bloom, lots of butterflies on the trail and saw a few moose. Parking is tight but the trail itself wasn’t too busy. Keep an ear out for cyclists both ways!"
74,2018-06-24,['hiking'],"Mellow trail (except for speeding bikers), pretty lake"
75,2018-06-23,['hiking'],"Went about 10 AM and the parking lot was full, but the trail didn’t have too many people on it.  Lake at the end is worth the climb.  Lots of mountain bikers so be aware of them."
76,2018-06-22,[''],awesome hike
77,2018-06-18,['hiking'],"Great hike with some elevation gain. I suggest leaving early as the trail gets crowded. Had a few issues with mountain bikers descending and passing with no bel or no warning. This could make things a little hazardous. All in all, I recommend this hike and look forward to running it."
78,2018-06-14,[''],Great hike. Even better if you go past the lake to the ridgeline above. Great views. Also a short side trip to Dog Lake to the west is worth it.
79,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"Easy to follow trail. There's two obvious forks, just follow the signs that point right to Desolation. Tennis shoes are ok if you're confident in your ankles. Right now most the snow has melted and the trail is pretty dry. The lake is absolutely beautiful right now. Decent amount of shade, not too many bugs. Would recommend for an afternoon hike. Give yourself 4-5 hours so you have time to walk around the lake and take in the sights"
80,2018-06-03,[''],"Ran this this evening. It’s a climb, but really doable if you’re looking for something with a little elevation."
81,2018-06-01,['hiking'],"Really like this hike as it is some distance but workable.  The lake this time of year is nice,  and the temperatures are usually pleasant at altitude.  There were just a few small patches of snow but easily doable in tennis shoes.  I like the previous poster would recommend a sweater or shell as if the weather changes it could get slightly cool.  Great hike ."
82,2018-05-29,['hiking'],"Amazing trail with a gorgeous ending point. The lake isn’t frozen anymore and there is very light snow, if any. We went yesterday and there was a lot of fog towards the end but it was breathtaking. When we got to the lake the fog slowly rolled away. My favorite part is walking over to the East side and hearing the echo when you yell. :) I would recommend bringing a sweater just in case because it started raining and it was a little cold. This trail was really enjoyable and I would recommend it to everyone!"
83,2018-05-28,['hiking'],Hiked this on 5/26 and there was hardly any snow at the end - my sister was in regular Nike tennis shoes and was completely fine without more protective boots. Logged 8.0 miles. Gorgeous hike!
84,2018-05-26,['hiking'],"The hike was great, the parking lot was full but the trail wasn’t to busy once we got past the dog lake split off. The lake was beautiful the aqua blue, there was still snow in patches on the trail. The lake was partially frozen still. The weather was perfect with no clouds."
85,2018-05-26,['hiking'],"I made a loop hike out of this one.  Went up Mill  D North to Desolation Lake and then over the ridge to descend via Bear  Trap Canyon. 
The trail to the lake is fairly easy and the snow is almost gone.  Lake is still frozen.  Very beautiful.  I was the only hiker at the lake. 
The descend via Bear Trap is not for the faint of heart.  lots of snow and the trail keeps disappearing.  without the app I could not have found my way down the mountain.  There's really not much to see that side of the ridge.  I recommend that you turn around at the lake and go back the same way you came. 
This will also save you hiking along Big Cottonwood Road for 1.5 miles to get back to your car."
86,2018-05-20,[''],"Just finished this trail-I hike  this several times a year. Don’t let the traffic in the parking area scare you. 99% of those people are going across the street to hike donut falls. Even with hundreds of cars up there, I only saw a total of about 15 groups  total between going up and down. The last half a mile is still really snow packed and the lake is mostly frozen over and incredibly beautiful! Love this hike!! (Just watch out on the way down for mountain bikers flying down and nearly hitting you)"
87,2018-05-20,[''],"Nice hike with lots of flat areas. The lake is still frozen and it’s really cold at the lake. Bring a jacket. Lots of snow at the very end. I’ve done this hike later in the year and it’s worth it to wait for the lake to be unfrozen, the color is breathtaking."
88,2018-04-30,['hiking'],"No snow for about the first mile then hit a slushy monorail all the way to the lake, minus a .25 section of no snow. Ok trail and ok views from the lake. Not much post holing and the trail never was steep enough to warrant spikes. If you can take the trail up to desolation peak, do it. It was the best part of my hike by far"
89,2018-01-29,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. The lower parts are well packed down. After the split with Dog Lake the trail gets narrower and more spots where hiking boots fall through the trail. The hike was still doable in boots but it looked like it was more fun to cross country ski.
90,2017-12-29,[''],"Nice long hike. Gradual incline is nice for this longer hike. Trail nice and packed down, brought snowshoes but got by with microspikes no problem."
91,2017-12-12,['hiking'],"Took the trail 11/24/2017. Quite a bit of ice, snow and mud for the first 2 miles. Snow up to a foot deep after that. Lake was frozen (don't recommend walking on it). It was about 40 degrees on top so be prepared for the temp chsnge this time of year. Lovely trail with some nice views."
92,2017-11-17,['backpacking'],"I love coming up here! 3rd Time in less than a year. Its a great get away from SLC and perfect for after work backpacking that is not too intense.

Was up here 11/3/2017 the lake was really low and there was a bit of snow (but the trail was mostly clear) we were prepared for the low temps and had an amazing time!"
93,2017-10-17,[''],awesome hike
94,2017-10-15,['backpacking'],Good hike. Great views. Lake is smaller than I expected though. Camped on the far side of the lake. Low temps. Woke up and 3/4 of the Lake had a sheet of ice on it. Make sure you have the right gear if you plan to stay up there at night. Lots of ground covered with snow as you reach the top.
95,2017-10-07,['hiking'],"Nice trail, head up to dog lake first at the fork its about 2 miles up? Once at dog lake there is a new trail you can follow back to the desolation trail it’s about a mile "
96,2017-08-29,['hiking'],"A very nicely maintained easy use trail.   Most of the surface is dirt with occasional small rocky areas.  The top of the trail features a lake, which you cannot go into at all as it is part of a watershed.   Please watch out for speeding trail bikers."
97,2017-08-27,[''],"Well traveled, beauiful hike with steady climb. Can't wait to go again when the aspen are changing. Took me four hours round trip which includes a half hour lunch at the lake."
98,2017-08-26,[''],Great hike to Desolation then up to the summit looking down on Park City. Then down the trail and back up the new trail to Dog Lake. 10 miles round trip. 2400 elevation gained. Beautiful views
99,2017-08-20,['trail running'],"Another one of my favorite Wasatch trails. Largely runnable trail up through pines and aspens with a few steep climbs. Incredible wildflowers. You can stop at Desolation Lake, or continue up onto the Wasatch Crest trail and take ridge trail all the way to Brighton at the top of Big Cottonwood Canyon (so long as you've got a way to get back down to your car at Mill D). You have to listen and watch for descending bikers coming fast around corners. I love the upper meadows as you get near Desolation Lake."
100,2017-08-18,['hiking'],"This is a great hike!! The hardest part is the first 1.5 miles and even that is not that bad. Go early, be on the trail by 8am and you'll be in the shade of the mountain until reach the beautiful Aspen canopy that covers most of the trail. It took us 2 hrs up and 1.5 down. Be sure to listen for bikers as it's a popular downhill in the morning. The wildflowers are amazing right now too!!"
101,2017-08-10,[''],"Great hike overall! It was a good combination of wooded (shaded) areas, meadows, inclined and flat stretches. It took us 3.5 hours to go roughly 8 miles round trip (we ate lunch at the lake and stopped to take pictures along the way)."
102,2017-08-09,['hiking'],Pretty easy. Beautiful scenery. On the way down we saw a large bull moose grazing in a meadow. The lack of trees along the lake shoreline is unique but unimpressive.
103,2017-08-03,['hiking'],Moose and deer and wildflowers!!
104,2017-07-31,[''],"My fave trail in BC -- mtn bike up to the spine then zip down. Try to be first on trail to see all the wild life ... today: 5 moose, deer. A few weeks back a black bear. Sundays better than Saturday if you're a 7th Day Adventurist."
105,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"Nice stream and wild flower all along the trail. And the lake is such a nice cool fun place. Bring your swimming pants lol. If you are lucky, you will see tons of tiger salamanders there in the corner of lake."
106,2017-07-29,['hiking'],"This is probably one of my new favorite hikes. I got to the trailhead at about 8am on a Saturday morning. I was afraid it would already be buzzing with people, but it wasn't! I passed only one person who was also headed up...she was so busy talking on the phone that she couldn't really do the trail running it seemed that she had planned on doing there. So annoying. Can't people just disconnect for a few hours? Anyway, saw a few people coming down...mostly trail runners. Also saw quite a few groups of mountain bikers, but all of them were very nice and let me know how many people were behind them as they each passed me. Saw a moose mama and a moose baby, which was terrifying. A group of bikers were headed down and scared them so they came barreling through the woods and across the trail between me and the bikers. I was so afraid the mama would charge me, but I don't think she saw me. They are huge!!! Other then them I didn't see any other animals. The lake was nice and peaceful. I was alone at first and then only about 5 other people came before I left. Morning really is the best time to come. You miss a lot of the larger groups and families. I did the whole hike in 4 hours. Will definitely be back."
107,2017-07-29,[''],"The trail and views from the trail are beautiful! And the lake is awesome! We were basically the only people at the lake. We didn't see any moose, but we did see moose tracks near the water. We did see a lot of salamanders in the water though!"
108,2017-07-20,['backpacking'],"Moderately strenuous for sure. Beautiful views throughout. We saw a ram and some smaller wildlife. It was fairly busy though. Lots of people on bikes blazing through, so you got to keep your eyes out. Once you get to the lake it isn't very busy."
109,2017-07-16,['hiking'],
110,2017-07-15,[''],"Gorgeous trail!  It was quite a bit steeper than I was planning on, but the scenery and wildflowers made it so worth the effort.  We started the hike about 6:30, and made it back before noon.  This was with plenty of water breaks, and lunch near the lake.   Saw a few salamanders, and lots of chipmunks and squirrels.  Pretty busy on a Saturday in July.  Definitely go early to avoid the heat and bugs."
111,2017-07-12,['hiking'],Great trail that isn't too difficult if you've hiked a bit. The first part isn't very shaded and gets hot if you don't go early. I've done this hike twice and both times I was almost alone on the trail. Both were weekdays. Wildflowers were beautiful!
112,2017-07-11,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, flys we're a bugging:) 
On the way down about a mile or so took a smaller trail to right a slight climb, ended at dog lake. very nice, trail looks newly cut, a great connector between the two lakes."
113,2017-07-10,['hiking'],"Great Hike!  wildflowers were exploding color.  Did not have a problem with flies or bugs, but that may have been due to the early start.  Encountered a few mountain bikers near the lake."
114,2017-07-10,['hiking'],"Good overall. I would suggest not going during the heat of the day, I don’t know how this trail typically is, but there were tons of flies/bees around. Got bit quite a few times. Took ~2:15 minutes up and 1:45 on the way back. Nice lake view at the end (was also buggy)."
115,2017-07-08,['hiking'],"The wildflowers and creek along this trail are so beautiful!!  The lake is a beautiful emerald green.  Long hike, but pretty easy mild climb with a smooth trail most of the way."
116,2017-07-06,['hiking'],So pretty this time of year (July). Saw a young moose in the small pond on the first 1/2 of the trail! Gorgeous wildflowers are out.
117,2017-07-06,['hiking'],"Great hike, it gets really hot and muggy so go early in the summer. There were wild flowers everywhere which was really pretty! When we got to the lake there were hundreds of salamanders in it! That was pretty neat to see!"
118,2017-07-03,['hiking'],"This was an amazing hike, possibly the prettiest I have done, The wildflowers were in full bloom. The trail runs along a small stream, through forested areas and meadows, and the views are beautiful. The elevation gain is steady but, with the exception of a somewhat steep start and ending, not especially difficult.  It took us 1:45 minutes up and about 1:20 down. Watch out for mountain bikers."
119,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"Views! Aspens! Deer and adorable rodents! Beautiful lake!  Always a great hike. Not a lightly trafficked trail, though.

You can get up to and down from Desolation Lake and nearby Dog Lake in a variety of ways, starting or ending at Butler's Fork or Beartrap Fork as well as Mill D.  If you have the energy to climb up to the crest above the lake (not that hard, actually, and you get to look down to Park City), you can come down the Beartrap Fork trail, but then you have to walk about a mile down the road to get back to your car and that always makes me grumpy."
120,2017-07-01,['mountain biking'],"Great Trail, great views. Great environments."
121,2017-06-28,['hiking'],Loved this trail. It was beautiful. Stunning scenery. Not many people but it is a Wednesday.
122,2017-06-26,[''],"Love this trail with all the aspens. There is still patches of snow up at the lake on the East side. Backpacked up & camped
we had the whole East side to ourselves. Saw a beautiful bull moose on the way up. This trail you should definitely bring a couple liters of water."
123,2017-06-24,['hiking'],Great hike!! Wildflowers the entire way. Spent the night up by the lake. Snow patches had nearly all melted away. Saw some moose. Trail was busy heading back down Saturday morning but an amazing moderately easy hike!
124,2017-06-23,['hiking'],Beautiful. Uphill all the way. Saw a couple deer. A bit chilly after the sunset.
125,2017-06-20,['hiking'],"great trail. evenly shaded and sun. uphill, but elevation gain is spread out so its not too steep. gorgeous views along the trail. went early afternoon and trail on a Saturday wasn't busy."
126,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike.  It is consistently uphill but the grade isn't bad at all.  Description says that this is a lightly trafficked hike, but it was booming with folks all day.  Most people are heading to Dog Lake however so once you split off to go towards Desolation Lake the numbers thin out considerably.  

Snow conditions are great.  A very modest and easily avoided patch on the trail to the lake, however some of the loop around the lake is still pretty covered with snow.  Not a problem."
127,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"One of my favorite trails!  Moderate climb and lots of friendly faces along the way.  A little muddy up near the lake and a bit of snow surrounding the lake.  Saw lots of campers hiking down.  Incredible views the entire way!  Thank you, Mother Earth!!"
128,2017-06-17,['hiking'],"Great hike today! Some snow around the lake but you won't be walking in any on the way up. For those who get chilly easily, might be a good idea to take a light sweater if you plan on hanging out at the lake long."
129,2017-06-14,['hiking'],Beautiful chill hike. Still some snow around the lake.
130,2017-06-12,['hiking'],Pretty mellow.
131,2017-06-12,['hiking'],"Went On Saturday with my Wife. 
Great Hike. Muddy as you get closer to the Lake. Snow Pack on a little of the trail, but it's not real bad."
132,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"This hike seems to be a good choice if you want to start later in the day during the Summer when Lake Blanche Trail gets packed. Not a ton of traffic on the trail.

About 100 yds. of snow left on the trail but easy traversing. Might want to bring a light shell -- the wind was gusting pretty heavy at the lake."
133,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"Great trail, only gradual incline and quite easy. Snow is gone so no need to wait any longer to do this one. Took a detour to Dog Lake on the way back and it was actually harder than Desolation."
134,2017-06-07,['hiking'],"Went about a week ago, still a bit of snow and because of my shoes I couldn't make it to the lake. But it was still beautiful the whole way up, and I'll be going again when the snow is gone!"
135,2017-06-06,[''],"Love this trail. Good distance, not too hard, and very beautiful. Still snow about last tenth of a mile. Easy to navigate though."
136,2017-06-05,['hiking'],"I logged 9.0 miles total, still lots of snow in the last half mile before the lake. 140 min up and 80 minutes back down. Never very steep, just a steady ascent. Beautiful sunrise views, I started 30 minutes before dawn."
137,2017-05-30,['backpacking'],Great trail. The last half mile is still in snow pack and the lake is just beginning to thaw. Plenty of deer and moose. Good mountain views.
138,2017-05-14,['camping'],Beautiful trail! There's still a decent amount of snow in the second half of the trail. The lake is mostly covered with snow.
139,2017-05-07,['hiking'],Beautiful lake.
140,2017-04-12,[''],Amazing view and pretty easy hike!!
141,2017-04-08,['hiking'],"Hike to Desolation snow pond yesterday morning. Not much snow on the initial part of the trail from Mill D. However, a lot of snow for 3 miles to Desolation snow pond (lake). Not many boot prints in the snow  on this trail and only one set from about 1/2 mile out to the lake. Was a beautiful day to hike and enjoyed the serenity of the trail.  Just over 2 hours up to the lake, 80 minutes down."
142,2017-02-02,['hiking'],"This was a great hike, and although I did it late in the year, it was actually a great time to go because I had the entire like to myself for a little while. It was incredible how serene and quiet it was...I almost felt like every move I made was disturbing the peace. Will definitely try to do this one again! Originally I combined this with a climb up Reynold's peak, but that ended up being a bit too exhausting for me. Next time I will probably split the two up for a more enjoyable if slightly less exhausting trip."
143,2016-11-30,['snowshoeing'],I went snowshoeing here yesterday. About a mile up I saw moose tracks and sure enough there was either a calf or cow right on the trail!
144,2016-11-24,['hiking'],"We got to see some more moose, and love hiking in the snow.  There was about 8 to 10 inches of snow at the top."
145,2016-10-30,['hiking'],Nice hike with a pretty lake at the end. It has some steady uphill but not terribly steep. I passed several people on my way up and down and there were a few at the lake when I got there. I did this hike on a weekend at the end of October. All of the fall colors were over but it was still a pretty hike. This hike has a lot of aspens so could really be pretty throughout the early fall when the leaves start to change. The lake level was probably lower being the end of the fall. I'd also give it a try in the early summer and see how it's different.
146,2016-10-26,[''],One of my favorite Utah lake hikes!!!!
147,2016-10-25,['hiking'],It was long but pretty easy. My 60 year old mother hiked with me so for sure doable. The Lake was a very beautiful color but I still prefer lake Blanche if you are up for a slightly more challenging hike.
148,2016-10-24,['hiking'],
149,2016-10-11,['hiking'],"I did this as a loop with Beartrap Fork that I found quite lovely.  It adds a few hundred feet of elevation, but pays off in terms of view heading both directions from the Wasatch Crest.  The loop does involve walking along the road for 1.8 miles.  The section of Mill D heading toward Dog Lake is pretty crowded, but much less so once you turn toward Desolation."
150,2016-10-03,['hiking'],Beautiful fall hike!  The colors were amazing.  The extra 1/2 mile to the ridge was a must.  The view was incredible--best part of the hike!
151,2016-10-01,[''],Amazing. You will love it!! Go NOW!! The fall COLORS are spectacular!!
152,2016-09-28,['hiking'],"Loved this hike, definitely go up the extra half mile towards guardsman pass it's worth the view of PC."
153,2016-09-20,[''],Beautiful and great workout!.
154,2016-09-18,['hiking'],Really nice hike if you have kids and you wanna make it all the way to the lake take lots of water and bars take lots of rest it's worth
155,2016-09-13,['hiking'],Love the solitude and beauty of teh trail. Not crowded even on a busy fall sunday. Head up to the Crest adding another 1 mile nack/ forth - teh views are amazing. you will be happy you did.
156,2016-09-12,[''],Beautiful hike. The lake is a wonderful spot to enjoy lunch and a nap. The hike down was a breeze!
157,2016-09-11,[''],"One of my favorites. East to follow and a nice steady grade! Pack food, it does take while to get there and can be cool at the lake. Usually not very busy."
158,2016-09-06,['hiking'],Great end destination!!! Hike is doable for most people.
159,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Did this trail in early June. Snow still present for last 1/4 mile, but passable in regular hiking boots.

If you're just starting out, this is a good test of your capabilities. It's long enough & tough enough to be a challenge, but not too much of either. Views at the end are great"
160,2016-08-31,[''],Loved this hike! The trail is so well groomed and well marked. I definitely would take the extra time to go up the ridge and look down into the Canyons ski resort and park city!! IT'S SPECTACULAR!
161,2016-08-14,[''],"A great hike, long enough to constitute not being a quickie, but not an all day affair either. When you get to the lake make the extra effort and take the trail up to the top of the ridge where it will meet the Wasatch Crest trail, and an EASY 10 mins up the ridge you can look down into Park City ski area and the town of Park City... A nice bonus is to go down Beartrap Fork and then walk BCC road down to your car."
162,2016-08-06,['hiking'],On the easy side of moderate. Trail has bikers that fly down it so be careful. Not one I will do again.
163,2016-08-04,['hiking'],"I hiked to dog lake then to lake desolation. It ended up being about 10 miles total, I recorded my hike but the gps must not have been working too well, the recording was spotty. It is definitely a moderate hike, not easy. There were two bull moose in lake desolation, very cool!"
164,2016-07-23,['hiking'],Narrow trail with too many bikers
165,2016-07-19,['hiking'],The hike overall was so beautiful there was so many flowers and wild life. There was a ton of bugs! We encountered a couple of moose. That was kind of scary. And it was REALLY long. Me and my boyfriend aren't big hikers but we love going on them and have been to many oft n but this was was a little tiring. Overall it was gorgeous though
166,2016-07-17,['backpacking'],"Great time to go on this trail! Tons of wildflowers and not very many bugs. There are probably 100+ salamanders in the south end of the lake, hiding in the silt. Wake up early enough and you're bound to see deer and/or moose.  I also noticed elk and coyote tracks in the mud around the lake. Very quiet and serene."
167,2016-07-13,['hiking'],"Great day for a hike, was a nice 55 in the morning. Hike was perfect for me enough uphill to get a work out but not the whole way. One of the better hikes I have been on in awhile. I say a moose with her calf and two deer while on the trail. I like this hike because it gives you good distance and a mixture of different terrain."
168,2016-07-10,['hiking'],Loved this hike will do it again for sure!
169,2016-07-07,['hiking'],"Such an awesome hike! I had done Dog Lake before and loved it. I wanted to come back and do both trails. Finally got it done today. It is uphill most of the way but pretty shady. Lots of wildlife right now. I saw so many butterflies, squirrels, caterpillar, etc. During the fall I saw a moose!! I think this hike is pretty difficult and I'm an avid hiker. So tired but worth it. I had the lake to myself today while I ate my lunch. Put it on your bucket list this summer!"
170,2016-07-04,[''],Best hike this year so far. Make sure you bring bug spray. Wild flowers are beautiful.
171,2016-06-28,['hiking'],"This was a fun, scenic hike. I highly recommend continuing another half mile past the lake up the switch backs to catch some incredible views. There are a fair amount of people on it, and I ran across a dozen or so mountain bikers, but it never felt crowded. Keep your eyes open for wildlife, as I ran across a young bull moose and an old buck. Weather was about 80 in the afteenoon."
172,2016-06-27,['backpacking'],"Pretty decent hike, constant elevation climb all the way to the lake; but well worth it. As many others have posted here watch out for Mountain Bikers as they are plentiful and are usually ripping down this trail at high speed.

Lots of camping spots available up at the lake, but watch out plenty of mosquitoes and horse flies as you enter into the lake (bring plenty of DEET).

The first half of the trail is pretty rocky and steep (sketchy for novice mountain bikers) but as you get further up the trail becomes much smoother. We had a moose and deer sighting in the meadow shortly before the lake!"
173,2016-06-26,['hiking'],By far one of my top 3 favorite hikes in Utah! Beautiful meadows all the way up and once you get to the lake it's guaranteed to take your breath away! Made a quick two minute video of what's it's like to hike up if anyone is interested! The link to the video: https://youtu.be/37R_wVTGjbU
174,2016-06-26,[''],One of my favorites!
175,2016-06-20,['hiking'],"This hike has it all.  There's plentiful shade almost the entire way, for parts you are walking through beautiful forests, along a rushing creek, and of course the lake at the end.  Desolation Lake is a gorgeous teal color and the cirque it is in feels so quiet and secluded.  The trail itself is well maintained and easy to moderately sloped.  It would be a really good hike to bring kids on, but it is a long hike!  The trail was not busy at all only saw 4 other hikers the whole time.  Highly recommended."
176,2016-06-18,['backpacking'],Fantastic
177,2016-06-17,[''],Great
178,2016-06-15,['hiking'],"Great hike, not too difficult.  I hiked it on 06/12 and almost all of the snow had melted off the trail.  Trail was nice and shady in the morning but heated up by mid afternoon.  We also hiked up the peak behind the lake which gives you views into PC."
179,2016-06-04,['hiking'],"Good hike, nice lake, still some snow that begins towards the last 300 yards."
180,2016-06-04,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. There is a small amount of snow at the very top but it's easy to walk over. The lake is partially covered in snow but it makes for a beautiful scene to look at. Go early if your hiking on a weekend it's getting busy up there.
181,2016-06-04,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike with a fairly steady incline. Hiked, Friday, 3 June 2016. I saw about 20 people, which was mostly before you get to the fork of Dog Lake and Desolation Lake. Approximately, 3.8 miles up the trail, snow was covering parts of it. The lake itself is gorgeous and mostly covered with snow. I highly recommend this hike."
182,2016-05-30,[''],Got about 2 miles in and it is beautiful!
183,2016-05-21,['hiking'],"We only went about 2 or so miles in, but it was beautiful.  There has been a lot of rain recently, so the creeks were really rushing and there are two cool waterfalls right at 2 miles in.  Parts of the trail are a little steep, but there are also a lot of places where the incline is nearly flat, so that was nice."
184,2016-05-17,['hiking'],"Pretty nice trail. Went on May 14th and it was 70% covered in snow. It was hard-packed on the way up so it wasn't bad, but since it was 80+ degrees, the snow melted through the day and it melted A LOT on the way down. So much we each sank about 15 times in some newly melted snow on the way down. Sank down to about our thighs multiple times. The lake is frozen but thawing out. BE CAREFUL as it started thawing out underneath us. The edge of the lake is not where it seems. It's outside of it. Really worth it to make to the lake. Only wear hiking shoes or you will slip a lot."
185,2016-05-10,[''],"Pretty easy to get there. The only issue right now is the snow, there's a lot of it. Lake was frozen of course. Bring some snow shoes or hiking shoes and you should be fine. It took me about 1:50 to get there because the snow slowed me down."
186,2016-04-21,[''],Enjoyed it but wish I could have made it to desolation lake unfortunately the snow made that hard so I just went as far as I could then trekked back. I really loved the quietness
187,2016-03-21,[''],"The lake is beautiful. If you want to kill two birds with one stone, there is also a way to dog lake. I went in the summer time, there was a lot of bikers, so be aware of that."
188,2016-02-21,['snowshoeing'],"Pines and Spruce, check. Aspen groves, check. Amazing view of the Wasatch Mountains, check. This trail has a nice incline and great sights. Great snowshoe trip in February."
189,2016-01-12,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! I didn't complete the whole thing but I would've loved to. 
You can hike this in normal hiking shoes during the winter, no spikes needed, and if it hasn't snowed heavily, no snowshoes needed. A lot of potential for xc skiing."
190,2016-01-06,['hiking'],Great. There is an option to take a shorter  route to dog lake too.
191,2015-12-29,[''],Love this hike all year long. Just did it for the first time with snow and it was even more beautiful. The trail was already groomed and we only wore microspikes but they werent really necessary. We saw people on snow shoes and xc skiing as well. Game trails and scat littered the area- we didnt see a moose but someone hiking around the same time we were did see one. This trail is definitely a workout but the views are worth it!
192,2015-11-28,['snowshoeing'],Great day. Almost had the trail to ourselves today. Just saw 2 other hikers. Of course a 6:50 start at first light must have been part of the reason. Haven't been on this trail for 45 years. Hiking in the winter for the first time. I had forgotten how beautiful it was especially with a flocking of snow on the trees.
193,2015-10-20,[''],"In the fall, you can hike so close up to large bright yellow aspens you can hug them. Getting to the lake up in a small basin was a sight to behold."
194,2015-10-16,[''],"It was definitely a work out, but it was worth it!

The lake itself was amazing, crystal clear.. We saw a couple of birds, deer and a moose. Highly recommend this hike! It's beautiful, especially around fall, shows its real colors!"
195,2015-10-15,['hiking'],"Favorite hike so far! Definitely not the easiest trail, on the other hand one of the most beautiful. Didn't go to the overlook but from what everyone said on the hike, it is well worth it. A lot of mountain bikes and a somewhat narrow trail so be careful and keep an eye out."
196,2015-10-09,['hiking'],"This is my new favorite hike, it was a bit long and there are a bunch of mountain bikers but it was worth it! It's truly a beautiful place!"
197,2015-09-25,['hiking'],Great weekday fall hike
198,2015-09-09,['hiking'],Nice hike. Watch out for mt bikers. very diverse for each season.
199,2015-08-30,['hiking'],"Fun easy hike, map is a little off, at the fork to Dog Lake/ Lake Desolation the forest service blocked an existing short cut so the total distance is 3.9 miles where as it shows 3.4 miles. Trail is easy to follow at that point."
200,2015-08-22,[''],Moderate hike. Steep incline to dog lake. Nice shady spots- definitely a good workout
201,2015-08-19,['hiking'],"The lake is absolutely beautiful!  Definitely a moderate hike, but it was worth it.  Most of the trail is in the sun, so make sure you bring plenty of water.  Lastly, there were a lot of bikes on the trail the day we went, so watch out for that."
202,2015-08-13,['hiking'],
203,2015-07-17,['trail running'],"Moderately difficult, but long. It allows bikes. Thus, it is largely cleared of heavy vegetation during the summer. There are not many rocks on the trail. Not very steep. Very runnable. The lake looks fantastic in the summer. Wish I could camp there some day."
204,2015-07-16,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike and pretty easy to do. Just watch out for Mountain Bikers- you do share the trail with them! We saw a lot of wildlife as well. Elk, Moose, Deer and a bat. 
We started this hike about 6:30 p.m. and got to the Lake in time for sunset-probably why we saw so many animals. We hiked back under the stars. Took us about 3.5 hours RT with a few stops to take cover from an afternoon rain storm!"
205,2015-07-14,['cross country skiing'],Awesome hike!
206,2015-07-13,[''],Nice shaded parts. Steep incline to Dog Lake.
207,2015-06-30,['hiking'],Fun trail up to dog lake
208,2015-06-28,[''],Dog Lake is a stagnant pond.
209,2015-06-27,['hiking'],Good hike for the family.
210,2015-06-25,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike and thoroughly enjoyable. I am not sure what I would to to change it to make it any better. I'm always happy when a trail starts with a well marked trail head, which this does. The trail head marker is the Mill D North Fork Trail head and part of the trail follows the Mill D North Fork river. It is not listed in Google maps, but the Lake Blanche Trail head does come up on Google maps and this trail head is about 4-5 miles east of Lake Blanche. There is a large designated parking area and even restrooms across the road.

The trail is a solid moderate level. If consider yourself to be in decent physical condition and can normally hike 7+miles with some incline, then you should be able to hike this trail. If you are not, or not acclimatized to the altitude, this trail may be hard for you. It is 1900 ft of elevation from bottom to top and the hike goes more or less up the first half and down the second. There were no parts of the trail that I felt were extremely steep so you could come down it in tennis shoes as opposed to hiking boots. 

The first part of the the trail winds up the side of a mountain. It is predominantly shaded most of the climb which is nice. It then follows up alongside the Mill D North Fork river, which is absolutely stunning this time of the year. Because of all the rain, the river basin is filled with green and wildflowers. About half way up you will hit a very clearly marked sign showing the trail to Dog Lake. We kept going up to Desolation Lake. The Lake itself is clear and beautiful, a great place to stop and have lunch. I think the hike took up somewhere between 4-41/2 hours including stopping for lunch and wondering around the lake."
211,2015-06-20,[''],"Great Hike Today, it was hot. Not too many people on the trail. Bikers should have been biking the Huntsman 140 :)"
212,2015-06-11,[''],So much fun!! I wouldn't really say it's an easy hike though... It's a pretty steep uphill for most of the way there! But the lake it definitely worth the hard work. So peaceful and beautiful once you reach the top. I definitely plan on doing this hike again!
213,2015-05-29,['hiking'],"It is an awesome hike!! It was a perfect sunny day to hike anywhere in the Salt Lake valley. Somehow I thought the hike would be difficult, yea it was everything, but that lol. No parts during the hike I would consider steep. There was a bit of snow right before the lake, but not enough to worry about. It took me a little over an hour to get there. The lake is beautiful, very quiet and peaceful!! I took my sweet time heading back. I took lots of pictures of the amazing scenery. I would definately hike it again this summer."
214,2015-02-16,['hiking'],Had a great day in the bright sunshine with my wife. Trail was slick in spots but not too bad. Got all the way up to dog lake and had some lunch then turned around and came back. Trail was slushy on the way back but easy to navigate. Planning a trip back up to do a winter overnighter. :)
215,2014-10-19,[''],Such a beautiful hike. For the hike was almost 9 miles from the trail head at Mill D. Stunning views!
216,2014-10-11,['hiking'],"Hiked on Labor Day with a pregnant party member (4.5 months) who had no problem with it at all, I would consider it moderate, at best. The views on this one remind me just how diverse the Wasatch Range really is, and is a very different experience to many other trails nearby. I enjoyed this one, and would like to plan an over night trip next year to do some camping, fishing and wildlife photography. I have no problem stepping out of the way for mountain bikers, but would also appreciate a shout to let me know they're coming! Nice family hike, one I'll do again for sure."
217,2014-08-21,['snowshoeing'],I love this hike year round.  It is cool and green in the summer and a nice snowshoe hike in the winter with very heavy snow after a big storm.
218,2014-08-17,['hiking'],"Completed with children ages 8-13 who thoroughly enjoyed the hike. The forest service was creating a new section of trail to replace the old trail just after the fork to go to Dog Lake or Desolation.  It was interesting to watch them work to remove trees and shrubs with chainsaws and axes, then use that brush to fill in the old trail. The trail now has more of a wide switchback/curve, adding a small amount of distance, before it rejoins the old trail.  Watch carefully for the new trail after the sign. The new segment of the trail still had small roots which could occasionally catch a foot.  

Watch for mountain bikes on this hike. We encountered many and, while most were observant of hikers, one pair raced around a bend and nearly hit us. 

The lake was beautiful, though a bit low this time of year, we saw many salamanders in the clear water.  This is a great hike!"
219,2014-08-10,[''],"This was a pretty moderate trail. If you choose to go to dog lake that stretch is uphill for the whole .6 miles. But there are a lot of easy flat spots during this hike, with absolutely stunning views."
220,2014-07-22,[''],"Took my boys on this trail, the end was a killer, up hill all the way, but well worth it when we made our way to dog lake, we saw a  moose!  It was worth the sweat, and heat!  Take lots of water, and we wished we had some trail mix, or fruit or something, cause you work up an appetite on this trail."
221,2014-07-21,['hiking'],easy hike did it with my 5 and 6 year old children. It  gradually climbs the entire time but it wasn't hard. We were able to get to the lake in 90 mins. It's a beautiful area that's remote enough to maybe see only a few hikers on the trail.
222,2014-07-16,['hiking'],"I did this in mid June. Beautiful, incredibly green. The trail isn't particularly difficult but it is unrelenting, just a steady climb to the top. The lake was pretty, we went to the far side and found a little colony of mud-puppies (salamanders with external gills) under a log."
223,2014-07-11,[''],"I didn't have anything to do to day and I didn't want to do it sitting in a hotel room, so I decided to take a hike. I googled the best day hikes around Salt Lake City and did some research. The words Desolation Lake kept showing up. How could an author of all things dark not take a hike to Desolation Lake. What the perfect name.

So I got up this morning and took a short twenty minute drive from my hotel in the city to the trail head in the Wasatch Mountains. I like that it's so close. After a winding trip through forests and into the mountains, I arrived at the trail head. There was a sign about glacier movements. Desolation Lake was derived from a glacier.

Then I began the trek. The websites said it was a moderate hike and about 8 miles or 12.5 kilometers. It started out uphill. I'm not sure what I was thinking, but it kept being uphill for kilometer after kilometer. Holy damn but my legs and calves were smoking. My average heartbeat was 120 and I was breathing heavy. I tried to take pictures and look around, but for much of the ascent, I was watching the trail in front of me. 

I achieved the summit and the lake in 100 minutes, about twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Must have been my old Army DNA kicking in. I put my head down and my feet in front of me and took the hill.

Desolation Lake was beautiful. It had a glacial blue quality to it, but it also had a green tinge and a rust brown tinge. Not sure if these were from the reflections or what was in the water. I tried to capture it in several pictures. The lake itself is fed from snow melt and has no other source. 

And of course, I took a drink of the water in Desolation Lake. I mean how could I not?

The trip down was much easier, although six kilometers downhill was tough on my joints. I passed several other hikers and dodged some bikers who were descending at insane speeds (but looked like fun). I saw a chipmunk, some long red weasel who was too fast for me to take a picture of, and a dark blue Stellars Jay.

I also met a man from Alabama who'd never seen mountains this big, so he decided to hike them. Turns out that the trail head has an elevation of 7260 feet and the lake lies at 9760 feet. My watch told me that it was an ascent of  602 meters and a total descent of 780 meters. Uphill was murderous so I told him, ""It's all uphill from here."" He laughed with good humor.

One of the websites said this - ""The 1900 ft elevation gain from the trailhead to the lake is not one of the more strenuous grades in the Wasatch, but there are some stretches that are downright nasty. (My hiking buddy commented ""This is one steep Mother--I think he was talking about Mother Nature). On the whole, the trail varies between very steep to nice, easy stretches of flatness.""

I totally agree about the downright nasty stretches, but as far as the easy stretches of flatness? What trail are they talking about?

I encountered a Van Gogh palette of wildflowers, aspens rising like white sentinels all along the trail, and towering mountains in every direction. I also saw snow. In fact, I stood in some snow. In June!

And add to that I burned 880 calories on the ascent and 1259 total."
224,2014-07-05,['hiking'],Great hike would definitely do it again.
225,2014-06-17,['hiking'],"This trail was a climb all the way, the worst being the last stretch to Dog Lake. First backpacking trip, out of shape and carrying a 35 lb pack. Not the best trail to choose for my first time out. If you are a first time backpacker and or out of shape, its a climb! Dog lake was disappointing however I still filtered water from it for the hike out. Lots of traffic on the trail but only one camper. There are great camping sites to the South of the Lake. I will tackle this one again this year, just to prove to myself I can do it without stopping every 50 feet. All in all it was well worth my effort."
226,2014-01-07,['hiking'],Great trail. I hiked it Jan and not too difficult. I went to Dog Lake then backtracked and took the Desolation Lake trail. did it all in 6 hrs. Beautiful hike.
227,2013-11-10,['off road driving'],Havent been to the lake for a long time since it used to be open to motorcycles.
228,2013-09-23,['hiking'],"Great trail, challenging but not too difficult. I went at the end of September and the fall colors were fantastic, especially around the lake (see pics). Make sure to hike above the lake to get a better view of both the lake and Park City behind it. Access it via the Mill D trailhead (40.649613, -111.648099). Recommended fall hike!"
229,2013-08-05,['hiking'],Great trail. Easy climb to Dog Lake with only last half mile moderate climb.
230,2013-07-22,['hiking'],"Accessed this trail up Big Cottonwood Canyon. It's about 9 miles from the mouth of the canyon and will be on the left. On the opposite side of the canyon road is the Donut Falls trail.

Strenuous and constant incline with beautiful views of Big Cottonwood Canyon during the first steep incline. A lot of the trail runs through tall aspens and pines like most of the Big Cottonwood area. The lake is a jewel and a sight for sore eyes after the exhausting ascent. Well worth it! There's a ridge that circles the lake that gives breathtaking views.

I've done this hike in late summer and spring. This trip was in May and found the lake frozen and snow for about the last half mile. It was a welcome treat as I brought the snow shoes along just in case."
231,2013-05-11,['hiking'],"Great trail, beautiful scenery, fresh cool mountain air. Trail is well maintained but wet and muddy from the snow melt this time of year. Hiked into the snowline on semi-packed snow for the last mile or so. Well worth the hike in late May or June."
232,2012-10-22,['mountain biking'],"You can reach this lake from several access points.  The most common are the Mill D trailhead in Big Cottonwood Canyon and the Dog Lake Trailhead in Mill Creek Canyon.  My favorite trailhead is to start with a bike on the road to Guardsman's pass, and take the cutoff to Scott's pass and down the Wasatch back to Desolation Lake.  You can continue to descend into Mill D or Dog Lake.  You can't beat the views on this trail when the leaves are out in September and October."
