0,2019-09-04,['hiking'],Everything is dry. seriously is the strangest thing ever as we come here once every 2 weeks and it was awesome but is no more running creek. 
1,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Not the best hike in the area.  good for a nice leg stretch. Handful of bikes seen but all quite polite unlike what you see in other canyons.  if you park across the road where AllTrails directs you it is closer to 7.75 miles.  there is parking at the Temple Quarry trailhead that gets you on the same side of the road as the Little Cottonwood Creek Trail.  close enough to the road you can hear the cars over the river and smell the brakes as the cars come out of the canyon.  River still full in late July. 
2,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"The trail follows an old gravel/dirt road that was probably used to service the municipal works along the creek. Pipes and other remains of the works are still evident along the trail. The first half mile is mostly unshaded and within earshot of road traffic. Eventually you reach a paved road and houses and search for the trail next to a contemporary municipal project. Then it becomes more pleasant, entering the woods and following the creek. If you are hiking, do not expect mountain bikers to stop or even slow down a little. Although there weren’t many of them, even on a Sunday."
3,2019-07-22,[''],Very nice hike. Next to the river most the way up.
4,2019-07-16,"['mountain biking', 'rocky']",This trail has always been love hate for me. Work work work but then fun blast downhill. Good for short or longer ride.
5,2019-07-01,['hiking'],"This trail is great, but it’s 7-8 miles long and I thought it was a lot harder than people are saying. I do wish it was closer to the river so there would be some views but it’s mostly just trees and nothing else 
"
6,2019-06-30,['hiking'],lovely 
7,2019-06-28,['hiking'],"Good, simple trail."
8,2019-06-22,['walking'],beautiful trail. good place to take kids. it's really nice and easy. 
9,2019-06-17,['hiking'],"love it, great for photography !!!!"
10,2019-06-04,['hiking'],easy little hike for the family. 
11,2019-06-01,[''],Trail is well maintained. lots of water today as we hiked up it. There are a lot of bikes on this trail but it is wide enough that they can pass easily. The river is gorgeous and loud. some parts are exposed but the majority is hiking in shade. we were able to see a snake on the side of the trail which provided some excitement for the group.
12,2019-05-31,['hiking'],"The building ruin adds a touch of mystery, as well as the iron body of maybe a vehicle that ran off the road decades ago? Stream is lovely, granite boulders impressive, mountain bikers polite. Found a private spot for a hammock. "
13,2019-05-16,[''],Beautiful trail along a river with big trees. the trail is fairly wide and not to steep. Lots of mountain bikers.
14,2019-03-12,"['hiking', 'snow']",
15,2019-01-05,[''],"awesome hike, very few people and amazing scenery."
16,2018-11-26,['hiking'],"Quarry trail parking was covered in packed down snow. Parking across the street was clear. About 3” of snow on the start of the trail, probably 4-6 at the top. You may still be okay without spikes, but I would’ve been faster if I had them with me. Great option for a regular winter hike."
17,2018-10-28,['hiking'],I hiked the upper portion for 1.7 miles until it comes back up to the road. Starts just below the ruins of the old Mill. Loved this trail. Very peaceful and a gradual climb to get your heart going a bit. I only saw three mountain bikers and five bikers on this trail. I think I will start at the bottom for a snow shoeing adventure this winter.
18,2018-09-24,['trail running'],"In spite of being along the main road a lot of the time, this was a pretty and enjoyable trail! Lots of shade and some sun. Gets really good toward the highest point/furthest in. The river of beautiful and there are a lot of huge rocks. Also, plenty side trails too. The trail continues at the end of this trail, after the bad ass remains of a building, but I didn’t try it...yet!"
19,2018-08-11,['hiking'],"Other reviewer is correct..pic of lake for this trail is not correct so don't go just to see a lake.... don't think there is one there.   There is a river, some small bridges that cross it, and you get to do a hike that spreads the elevation change(1300+ ft) out across a longer distance so it makes it easier which is pretty cool.   I think I actually liked two other things the most...the old broken down stone chapel(I think that's what it is)at the end and the metal contraption thing that everybody has pictures of on here that is powered by water.  Despite watching it for 10 straight minutes I have no idea what the heck it's purpose was....but it was fascinating!!   Oh..and as a geocacher I need to point out that I found one out there.  Have a good one and enjoy the hike if you go!!!!  Oh....watch out for the mountain bikers as they come down the trail....they were all really nice and said thanks when I stopped and got to the side, but if some of them hit me going as fast as they were there might not be anything left of me....it looked really fun.....I have gotta try it some day if I can."
20,2018-08-03,[''],This is a really fun quick adventure with kids.
21,2018-07-28,[''],"Love this trail, beautiful all the way to the final destination, many places to stop and explore. One thing to be cautious of is bikers!! There are so many."
22,2018-05-29,[''],Super Duper easy trail. I think for our family would rather bike it then hike it next time. And there will be a next time
23,2018-05-24,['hiking'],"The trail is long and very easy and accessible, although it is not labeled very well and we ended up getting off track quite a bit. The ending has a cool mill across the creek to look at, but I do want to add that the picture that is displayed with the hike's name is NOT on this trail, it is a completely different hike. This trail does not lead to any overview of a lake."
24,2018-05-06,['hiking'],"This was a beautiful trail in May, after the snow melted. I made it out to the second bridge, my first time hiking this trail, which ended up being about 5.5 miles total. It was definitely on the moderate side of easy. Steady incline with some steep parts, the whole way. Also, there’s way too much graffiti on some of the boulders and you have to watch out for bikers. Overall, I love this trail for exercise and views. I went on a Saturday morning and honestly did not see a lot of kids here because this is not an easy one for them. Edited to add: Temple Quarry is an easy paved loop trail, appears to be very short but I haven’t tried it. Little Cottonwood is a moderate trail, and that’s more so the one I’m reviewing here. I parked at the Temple Quarry Trailhead."
25,2018-04-25,['hiking'],"Personally I enjoy this trail a lot. It follows the river and there’s lots to see along the way. I get about 15,000 steps in so I’ll use this trail for some exercise when I really don’t want to go to the gym. 

I wouldn’t necessarily classify this as “easy,” I would not want to make grandma do it. There is a gradual but continuous climb with some parts more steep and rocky/gravely than others. 

It’s also definitely a biking trail but the last few times I’ve hiked it there have been many more bike riders than hikers, so definitely keep an eye and ear out for them both from behind and above."
26,2018-04-15,['hiking'],fun easy hike the kids loved it. lots of boulders to climb and explore.
27,2018-04-09,[''],"Pretty day with intermittent snow fall. The trail is a little close to the road in the beginning. It still has icy and snow covered portions starting about 1/2 up. Keep an eye and ear out for downhill cyclists. With the deep melting snow, there isn’t much room to move if you get caught in an icy portion when they need to pass."
28,2018-03-30,[''],"Geocaches: bucket 
April-Jun"
29,2018-03-20,['hiking'],"Not a very steep hike! The ruins can only be seen from across a stream, but they were still cool to see. I just wish the trail wasn't next to the road almost the whole way, it somewhat takes away from a true nature experience."
30,2017-10-15,[''],Not too steep - great hike!
31,2017-09-03,['hiking'],
32,2017-08-25,[''],"This is a great trail for walking , more of a bike trail than anything but worth it"
33,2017-08-17,['hiking'],Great trail with few people. Nice breeze from river and lots of shade.
34,2017-07-02,[''],"Lots of graffiti and trash along the trail. Keep an eye out for mountain bikers, as some if them come zooming down the trail. Hearing the run off stream the whole way was pretty cool though!"
35,2017-07-01,['mountain biking'],
36,2017-06-16,['hiking'],"Starts at the temple quarry parking lot. I did not spend time on that loop, but it looked interesting with all the signs explaining some of the history. The first 1/2 mile of the hike was not very scenic, but that quickly changed once I passed the power plant (just walk through the parking lot & around the gate. There was abundant foliage for most of the trail providing ample morning shade. The majority of the trail follows the river, which is swollen with runoff this time of year. Once you cross the 3rd bridge, stay to the right. Trails going off to the left lead to other parking areas along the road. There were a plethora of mountain bikers on the trail & several runners as well. I imagine it would be packed on a weekend."
37,2017-06-02,['trail running'],"A great trail for runners! Note: its steep, so not for beginning runners!"
38,2017-05-13,['hiking'],I can't wait to do this again!  New to hiking and thrilled that I was able to make it to the end and back without tears! :)
39,2017-05-09,[''],Family friendly trail that includes a paved loop with signage that explains the history of the area.
40,2017-05-05,[''],"this trail had breathtaking views of towering, sheer-sided white granite (mozonite quartz actually) canyon  walls. easy and worth checking out."
41,2017-03-18,['walking'],Great path and views to explore with young children and beginners. Had a blast going into the dry riverbed and exploring the old structures. Interesting to see and learn how they mined for granite. The scars on the mountain are visible.
42,2017-01-28,['snowshoeing'],Followed the trail from the Temple Quarry Trailhead to about .5 miles aboue the Lisa Falls parking. As of today the trail is packed enough that snowshoes are not required until the trail junction near the Lisa Falls parking area. The trail is less traveled and .5 miles above the junction and we had to start breaking trail.
43,2017-01-01,['snowshoeing'],"This was my first time on the little cottonwood trail and first time snowshoeing (we skipped the temple quarry loop). It was a perfect beginner trail. We went 6 miles round trip. Very slight incline the whole way that we didn't really notice till we came back down. There were a few bikers in the snow, which was pretty fun to watch. We went early and were alone on the trail the majority of the time, more bodies as the morning went on. The water was even flowing pretty good and was gorgeous. Great snowshoeing trail!"
44,2016-11-21,['hiking'],Very easy hike. And very beautiful.
45,2016-10-22,['walking'],"This was basically a short walk with some pretty views. If you use the AllTrails map for directions it takes you to the park n' ride as where the trail begins which makes you cross the freeway to find the trail head. Not sure why it is set up that way but don't park there. Just turn around and park across the street so you don't have to cross a busy freeway. Otherwise the trail was ok. Some cool history behind the quarry stones but we probably won't be back here. Also, watch your kids around the trails here, we found a backpack with drug paraphernalia in it and tossed it in the trash."
46,2016-10-19,[''],"Very pretty Hike, simple."
47,2016-10-12,[''],Found this hike by accident looking for Lisa falls and I loved it. It was fairly flat so I was able to even run some of it. It runs along a creek so it was super peaceful and the fall colors were gorgeous. It was like being away somewhere completely different than the city. I absolutely loved the tranquility of this trail and easy to find.
48,2016-09-26,['walking'],"Three moms, three preschoolers, two toddlers and a new born. It was perfect for our group. the kids were able to climb and run, moms could chat and still keep up with kids. The foliage was beautiful. because it was paved we were able to use strollers, too. definitely not a hike, but great for a walk in nature."
49,2016-09-08,['walking'],"This doesn't qualify as a hike in my books, but it's still enjoyable. It's a completely paved loop that is short and has informational signs along the way. My kids loved reading the signs. The kids and I left the paved route and climbed all over the rocks in the dry creek bed which was their favorite part."
50,2016-09-04,['hiking'],Crazy cool history markers help you learn about the area and how pioneers used it. I'm not LDS and I still thought it was cool.
51,2016-08-30,['trail running'],fairly easy to moderate in terms of steepness. the flow of the river in the spring is crazy strong and beautiful to run next to!
52,2016-08-24,['hiking'],Enjoyable for our kids from 6-17.
53,2016-08-19,['hiking'],super easy loop part of it is wheelchair accessible. The river is dry but it's fun to walk through the granite river bed.  Good mountain biking trail that starts here too.
54,2016-08-12,[''],"Loved it, lots to learn as well!"
55,2016-07-25,[''],Not a hike as much as a walk. There was no water either. Cool history which is why it got a three.
56,2016-07-03,[''],There is absolutely nothing to do or view here. There is no water as it has been redirected...so just a normal walk.
57,2016-07-01,['walking'],Honestly I was a little disappointed this was so short and easy.  Luckily I planned a backup so we did Lisa Falls as well.  Bonus points for how close it is to town and the info signs teaching about the area
58,2016-06-29,[''],Awesome technical climb with rewarding downhill. Short and sweet
59,2016-06-28,['hiking'],Fun to play on the boulders in the creek bed
60,2016-06-27,['hiking'],Great little hike. My four little kids loved it. We even saw some repellers.
61,2016-06-24,[''],its a nice easy walk more than i hike. good to with children's too! we went there in june so there was a beautiful creek going just beside the trail and water level was pretty high! good hike for the beginners! but this hike doesn't end to any beautiful lake or mountain peak as you would expect with other hikes!!
62,2016-06-22,[''],The trail never seems to disappoint! We ran the trail and ended up continuing up the trail so we went 3 miles up and 3 miles back down. Great night run/hike and many cool opportunities for stunning pictures!
63,2016-06-15,['trail running'],"Mainly flat trail, that had a lot of things to look at. I continued to run up the trail and made it a long run. There's a lot of things to stop and look at like the temple quarry meetinghouse that is off to the side. Would recommend it for any age hiker, as well as runners. It also is pretty shaded."
64,2016-06-13,[''],It was beautiful!! All bikes should have a bell or horn :-)
65,2016-06-12,['hiking'],It was definitely beautiful and I loved the sound of the rushing water and overall out was an easy enough hike for the kids but there really were a lot of bikes.
66,2016-06-09,[''],Cool trail that has several placards that teach you about the history of the area. Definitely recommend!
67,2016-06-09,['hiking'],it was a great hike with the water rushing down the mountain
68,2016-05-29,['walking'],Awesome!
69,2016-05-27,['walking'],"We went on a walk with the kids and they loved it. We went in the morning, which made it nice and cool. There are signs along the way telling about the trail. The kids liked it, it took 20 minutes, and we will likely do it again. Great for kids."
70,2016-05-14,['hiking'],"It was cool to see the ruins of the old rock quarry, but there is a lot of graffiti"
71,2016-05-02,[''],This trail is well defined. The slightest incline. It's basically a flat trail. I love it. Great for bikes. Gorgeous the whole way.
72,2016-05-01,['hiking'],"Went up with my buddy Geno to get some exercise in with the backpacks and to test our water purification systems out.  Wonderful day, trail in Fantastic condition!  Not too many people on it today at all really."
73,2016-04-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful day for hiking, and the smell of the evergreens was wonderful!  BUT be careful of the bikers!!"
74,2016-04-02,['hiking'],Seems to be a lot of confusion about this trail and the Little Cottonwood Trail which share the same parking area.
75,2016-03-20,[''],Tons of rocks to climb and easy enough for kids.
76,2016-03-02,['hiking'],"It was an absolutely beautiful day to be out hiking! The trail is still snow packed with slushy snow which made it to where I was sinking in (went in boots, not snowshoes). Didn't go far up just because of the footing. The gate is closed so I just parked in the Park and Ride lot. Can't wait to return when the snow is gone and go a little further."
77,2015-09-16,[''],Easy and beautiful with some historic items and signs to read. It's paved so moms with strollers or people who have a hard time walking will enjoy this trail.
78,2015-09-01,['nature trips'],"Easy and beautiful.  This is a great place for engagement photography or graduation because it is short and not strenuous, so the subject doesn't have to worry about torn gowns or wedding dresses, wilted flowers, etc.  It is also very beautiful. My favorite thing about this trail is its educational value.  This is where the original temple walls were mined.  You can still see the dynamite holes that were drilled into the granite during its construction on many boulders along the trail. The igneous rock is mind boggling.  The thing I don't like is that no dogs are allowed. (Watershed)"
79,2015-08-31,['hiking'],Easy trail that parallels Little Cottonwood Creek
80,2015-07-19,[''],"Had run several times. Not too hard or technical. Well shaded after half a mile or so. Not well marked. Became rocky after 3 miles or so. After a couple of tries, could not find Lisa Fall. Disappointed."
81,2015-07-18,['walking'],"This is a short but sweet trail for my daughters (11&4) who love coming here for a nice spot to relax, play in the river, and picnic. 

Definitely recommend for kids."
82,2015-06-26,[''],"It was a steep out and all downhill back. It was a beautiful hike. Saw a decent amount of bikes and a runner. Saw lots of lizards. Would probably do again, but not until I've done others around it."
83,2015-06-15,[''],"Great hike for a new hiker or with young kids. Paved trails the entire way, but you can go on the dirt paths."
84,2015-06-12,['hiking'],Started this at the Lisa Falls trailhead and added the short jaunt to the falls to this hike.  After the falls. crossed Little Cottonwood Canyon Road and decended to the trail.  It was a pleasant downhill walk along the shaded stream with lots of interesting features.  Hiked one-way so we left a car at both ends of the trail.
85,2015-05-31,['hiking'],Besides the initial difficulty trying to find the trailI head it was a pretty average trail. I took my thee year old nephew and it was a great distance and terrain for him. Just be sure to bring sunscreen or a hat as the trail is pretty much in direct sun the entire time.
86,2015-05-26,['hiking'],Gentle hike aloong the thundering (probably because of high recent rainfall) creek. Pleasant but nothing special.
87,2014-09-26,['rock climbing'],"Great trail for kids! Also leads to to some great rock climbing. The ""Industrial Wall"" is a favorite of mine."
88,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"Wasn't very pleased with this trail. Felt like there was a lot of confusion with where the trail ended or started. I enjoyed the shade and beautiful scenery, however the trail definitely needs some kind of sign indicating the trail and the distance. Would return to experience it again."
89,2014-09-01,['hiking'],"Easy, paved trail at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon. Pretty views of the canyon."
90,2014-08-28,[''],"Hiked up to the residential area but didn't know that the trail continued (perhaps a sign indicating is in order). Lovely views, easy hike for the kids - we'll go back now that we know there's more to it!"
91,2014-08-17,['hiking'],"Completed 3/4 of this hike and loved it!   The hike is a bit confusing in the beginning though because it starts off with a sandy flat trail for 10 minutes then we discovered you have to hike on the residential road for a bit to get to the second part of the hike.  A bit disappointed that there were so many homes around in the beginning but the hike just gets more and more beautiful and interesting the further up you go.  You are next to a big raging river most of the way that keeps things nice and cool although you are under trees most of the time.  lots of critters to enjoy along the way.  The trail is pretty laid out, smooth, uphill with a few rocks and about 9 feet wide the entire time so plenty of space to walk next to your partner.  lots of scenic places to take pictures.  My favorite place was an abandoned, covered, open camp site with a fire place that had been tagged with lots of bright colors all around.  This was about half way through the hike and actually looked like a cool place to have a party lol.  I would rate this hike 4 stars.  5 if you know where you are going.  I wish hikes had more obvious signs so you don't have to guess.  I would say this is an easy hike if you can handle constant uphill travel."
92,2014-08-17,[''],Beautiful hike. Lots of trees and shade. Along a river. Very easy on the way out and just a little bit of an incline on the way back.
93,2014-07-08,[''],"Hiked around 6:00pm and a lot of bikers, coming fast down the trail. Easy hike with kids. It does end at a little rock building. Went running on it at 6:00 am, didn't see any bikers on a Sunday. Beautiful for running on. Not a great view for hiking. River is pretty."
94,2014-06-30,['hiking'],Easy walk along the river
95,2014-06-09,['hiking'],"Fun and easy hike.  Lots of shade.  Also would be good to access the creek for fishing, but the creek was roaring the day we were there.  The trail is used by mountain bikers, so stay alert on the turns."
96,2014-05-26,['walking'],"A very easy trail; perfect for young children.  It is wheelchair/stroller accessible and has an outhouse in the parking lot.  This path is mostly shaded.  There are signs explaining the history, but they are somewhat worn and some are hard to read."
97,2013-09-22,['hiking'],Nice and easy slope with only a few short steeper inclines.  Lots to look at between large granite boulders and many buildings.  We went up the Quarry trail onto Little Cottonwood and then crossed over to Lisa Falls.  Intermittent sun  with mostly shade. Really pretty along the creek.
98,2013-08-21,['hiking'],Really easy mellow hike with a lot of wild life around.. great spot to camp next to the river!
99,2013-01-20,['hiking'],This is a great trail for snowshoeing in the winter
100,2012-08-01,['hiking'],"Easy loop with some interpretive signs. Recommended to continue up the canyon on the little cottonwood canyon trail, past some homes and a water station about 3 miles to an old mill. Trail follows the creek."
101,2012-07-09,['hiking'],Very fun with our 5 year old!  It was manageable for him and loved the views of the river and mntns.
102,2012-05-12,['hiking'],"relatively moderate hike... constant uphill, a good amount of mountain bikers to watch out for as they come down pretty fast"
