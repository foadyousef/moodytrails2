Too bad. Now I’m probably going to have to go get a new boyfriend. "
2,2019-08-24,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Loved this quick hike! As everyone suggested, I went left at the start to a short but very steep incline, then it was mostly flat the entire way until coming back down. There wasn’t much shade and it was pretty hot, but I hit a breeze here and there so it was doable. Didn’t see anyone the first half hour, then as it hit 10:30 (Saturday morning) I saw several mountain bikers, a few people with dogs, and a couple other people. Stay alert for mountain bikers as they are going pretty fast and there are some areas of vegetation that you can’t see around. My dog had a great time but it took me about an hour to pick out all the burrs and foxtails once we got home. I wish I had taken my trekking poles, as another review had suggested, because coming down was a scramble of large loose rocks and I ended up falling once and had a few more slips. There are no signs and a lot of other trails connect so I kept the AllTrails map up the whole time so I knew I was going the right way. Overall, nice easy hike near the city and I’ll definitely be doing it again!"
3,2019-08-10,['hiking'],Good hike. not much shade but lots of breeze. Not too crowded on a Saturday morning. we took the left route as suggested and definitely a good choice as the right side was much steeper. Happy tip have my trek poles on the way down

6,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'no shade']",Trail wasn’t too hard.   Definitely take a left at the turn point on the map and make your way around as the right way is rockier and would be harder to go up IMO.  We took our dog and just moved to the side when we heard bikers coming so please be considerate of them on the trail too :).  Not much shade but we went today and it was cloudy for most of the trip.  Gorgeous views of the valley all the way from the beginning that keep getting better the more you go up!!  
7,2019-07-05,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",Took this with 6 kids (aged 5-10) and a dog. took 2 hours with lots of stops. highly recommended but do it in the morning.
8,2019-06-26,['hiking'],Great trail. Just moved to SLC and loved this hike
9,2019-06-17,['hiking'],"Nice hike! Great views of the city and once you get to the top there are yellow and purple wild flowers to run through. Not too crowded, was alone most of the time and I was walking. Passed a few doggies too. "
10,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'no shade']",Absolutely breathtaking views.  We took the loop to the left (advice from another review) and glad we did! The descent was a little tricky the closer we got to the bottom of the trail (lots of loose rock).  
11,2019-06-04,['hiking'],This is a great loop for an evening hike
12,2019-05-12,"['hiking', 'no shade']",was a decent hike but just really hot with no shade. amazing views and easy to follow trail. I'd suggest following the trail left as going up the right gets steep and rocky

15,2019-04-19,['hiking'],Got a quick 1 mile trailing to test the hike. Will be back to finish. Looks like a fun trail.
