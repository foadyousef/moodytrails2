0,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"The trail from Church fork towards Rattlesnake Gulch was easy and beautiful.  The path was in good condition. Since it was cloudy with light intermittent rain, it wore a completely serenading look (much respite from the dry heat). You could hear the lively creek during the initial part of the trail which was also mostly shaded. The trail opens up to lesser shaded areas and ones with vistas more towards the Rattlesnake Gulch area.  We met quite a few off leash dogs who seemed to like the trail too ;D 
There are atleast 3-4 picnic spots closer to the trailhead. 
Great hike! "
1,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"One of my more frequent hike/run/bike trails. I typically break it up into ~5 mile loops (Up Rattlesnake Gulch to to pipeline and head east along the trail to porter fork and then run down the road back to vehicle. Next loop is Porter Fork trailhead east to elbow fork and back down the road to vehicle. Loop from Church Fork to Elbow Fork and down the road for about 6-7 miles. If you are running/hiking and want to see fewer bikes on the trail do it on an odd number day. There will still be bikes on the trail but there will be fewer since the upper trails (big water/wasatch crest) are restricted to even number days (for bikers) so they won't be coming down pipeline from those trails on odd number days. Snake encounters are frequent on this trail (I've seen rubber boas, rattlesnakes, garter snakes).... That stick you see on the trail might be a 'nope-rope'."

4,2019-05-12,['walking'],"great trail, hard beginning but worth it in the end. took my dogs with and they had a blast."
5,2019-05-10,['hiking'],"I can see my house from the overlook so it’s one of my favorite trails to get a quick run in with my dogs. 

If you only have time for one trail in the area, I wouldn’t recommend it compared to grandeur or desolation."
6,2019-04-28,['hiking'],"Hiked this today and I wasn't a fan.  It's fairly steep, but that wasn't the bad part.  There's just no variation in the trail, the floor is all rocks, and there's little shade.  Do yourself a favor and go across the street and east a couple of miles to Desolation.  Gorgeous canopy of conifers with very diverse switchbacks."
7,2019-04-27,"['hiking', 'rocky']",My dog and I had a nice time. Most of it is straight uphill. Once you make it through that you get a nice walk with great views.  I would do it again any day. Lots of people but nicely spaced out. A lot of friendly dogs as well.
8,2019-04-20,['rocky'],
9,2019-01-06,[''],"Nice little hike, busy.  Lots of cross country and snow shoes but you don't have to have those as the snow is packed down.  Parking is a bit of a nightmare."
10,2019-01-02,['hiking'],"Hiked part of this trail from the Grandeur Peak trailhead at the Churchill campground on New Years Day. The snowy views were beautiful and with most of the trail in the sun, it was not too cold. No need for snowshoes or spikes, the trail is packed down, only icy in small spots."
11,2018-10-13,['hiking'],Nice trail. Very muddy right now with melted snow. A lot of downed branches across the path at the moment.
12,2018-09-15,[''],"Fairly easy hike, first part is a steady slight incline, eventually it levels out and then its just cake walk. Trail gets busy with runners and bikers but views are beautiful."
13,2018-08-26,[''],It is really cool at sunset
14,2018-08-23,[''],I would not call this an easy hike.  We stuck it out through 0.6 miles of basically straight uphill before we turned around.  The Mill D trail in Big Cottonwood is rated Moderate and was easier than this.
15,2018-08-20,[''],"My favorite trail to run on the Wasatch front- never steep, great views alternating with shade!"
16,2018-08-19,[''],"Easy hike, but great to get out door's."
17,2018-08-17,[''],For a beginner like me; this was a great hike with amazing views!
18,2018-08-12,[''],Good views of the city. No shade after the first climb.
19,2018-08-01,[''],I love coming to Millcreek canyon.  It is so beautiful.  I've done this trail a few times.  Great for trail running but it is novice so it gets busy.  lots of mountain bikers on this trail.
20,2018-07-14,[''],Once you reach the top it is amazing.
21,2018-07-11,['hiking'],"With all of the hiking choices in Millcreek Canyon, I am not in a big hurry to do this one again. I was just out for some exercise this morning, so I hiked an hour up the trail. The first 8/10ths of a mile is a very steady climb, but then it levels off. After the climb, the portion that I hiked did not have much shade, and it was close enough to the Boy Scout camp that I could hear their music and cheers. When I try this trail again, I will start from the upper trailhead to see if I can find a more peaceful setting."
22,2018-07-09,['hiking'],"This is a nice trail for running.  Once you make your initial climb, you get some good straight shots.  We hike from the church fork picnic area and come out at the big pipe with a great view of the valley.  You can start climbing again from there or call it a day."
23,2018-06-22,[''],"As a beginner and a big gal, I loved this hike. :)"
24,2018-06-20,['hiking'],"The trail is very nice. Steep in the beginning with rewarding views. The people who bring their dogs need to be held accountable for leaving bags of dog poo on the sides of the trail. Don't bag it if you are just going to leave it, just throw it off the trail with a stick..."
25,2018-06-18,[''],Great trail! Dog friendly. Very steep at the beginning but flattens out once you get about a half of a mile up!
26,2018-05-25,['hiking'],"Absolutely gorgeous up there right now! Not muddy at all, those the horse flies are really bad right now so bring bug spray or be prepared to get bitten."
27,2018-05-23,['hiking'],Which trail is good to start at - needs to be easy and not too steep? Thank You
28,2018-05-23,['hiking'],Great for walking the pup!! Beautiful wild flowers in May!
29,2018-04-21,['hiking'],"This is such an amazing hike. You start off with a steep hike upwards(not too strenuous) and then you get up to the shoreline trail, which wraps around the mountain, and gives an amazing view of SLC."
30,2018-04-01,[''],"Nice easy hike. Mostly uphill obviously. if you head East and get bored 2 hrs in like me you can just shortcut back down the side of the mountain, if you're at least 1/4 mountain goat."
31,2018-02-26,[''],Great winter walk. We started out with snowshoes and after several yards we decided the trail was packed well enough to go without.
32,2017-10-30,[''],Quiet trail and moderate traffic.  Nice getaway close to town.
33,2017-10-27,['hiking'],I loved it!! It is a moderate beginner hike but well worth the views!!!
34,2017-10-17,[''],"I particularly love this trail in the fall months. Explodes with gorgeous colors. Great for hiking, running, and biking, especially for amateur mtn bikers like myself. Dog friendly. It has multiple entry points so you can decide just how long you want to make your hike/ride."
35,2017-10-04,['mountain biking'],"Love biking this trail!! It’s great for beginners who are learning to handle their bike or for someone who wants a relaxed ride. There are only a couple of technical spots that are easily walked.
I prefer to start at the top of the canyon and bike to the end. Then I turn around and come back. But it can be done either way. Some people start at the top, bike to the end, turn around and only come part of the way back up when they go down a side trail to the canyon road. They then ride the canyon road down to the mouth of the canyon where a second car picks them up and takes them back to their car. Sound complicated but it’s actually fun.
Busy trail so watch for hikers and other bikers."
36,2017-10-02,['hiking'],"It's a steep start for the first 1.5 miles or so (started at the Rattlesnake Gulch Trailhead), but so worth it once you get to the top & the trail evens out."
37,2017-09-29,[''],Steep to get started but definitely worth the view of SLC!
38,2017-09-20,[''],Steep beginning but worth it!
39,2017-09-14,['hiking'],"Great hike! Started at Mount Aire trail head; once you get into the Wasatch National Park you will have multiple options for which trailhead you want to take. Mount Aire was bout 4 miles total round trip. 3/4 of the trail is covered by thick Forrest which is beautiful and follow a small stream - great for the dog to cool off in and grab a drink. You'll reach a spot where you think you've ""reached the top!"" Keep going to the right, but it's a great place to catch your breath and take in the awesome views. Starting at this point the trail does narrow and you are exposed to the sun the majority of the way up so bring water and coverage for the intense sun. Very worth to go all the way up, you see 360 degree views. Dogs are allowed off leash on ODD number days, we appreciated this! Only saw a few other hikers and dogs on a Wednesday afternoon. Can't wait to start at another trailhead to extend this hike!"
40,2017-09-04,['mountain biking'],Meh
41,2017-08-13,[''],"Hiked on pipeline trail from Burch hollow trailhead to grandeur peak trail then cut down into church fork picnic area. 1.6 miles of 90% downhill hiking, plus bridges and stream at the end - great for little kids. There are some steep drop offs so keep the kids close, but it was certainly doable with the two year olds holding hands with adults. We had a perfect hike!"
42,2017-08-07,['hiking'],"Such a fun and easy ""hike"" for anyone just getting into enjoying the Millcreek Canyon. Get an early start to beat the weekend trail traffic. Crossed paths with other dog walkers and trail runners. I'll definitely be returning."
43,2017-08-05,[''],"So, so, so much dog poop all over the trail and bags of dog crap thrown everywhere. Ruins this hike for me. Clean up after your dang animals or stay out."
44,2017-07-31,['trail running'],"I love this trail as easy to access and reliable for running but if you are a beginning runner, remember you must hike up to the trail before it levels off. Saw a rattler down low on the trail this last run."
45,2017-07-23,['hiking'],"Great easy hike in a beautiful canyon, and the multiple trailheads let you decide whether you want a short or a long hike. Trail is VERY narrow in places, so watch out for mountain bikes zooming around the bends. We went on an odd-numbered day when biking is prohibited, but we still had to look out for a few bikes racing along who had no intention of giving us the right of way as instructed by numerous signs. There is no shade anywhere near the western-facing lookout over the valley, so be ready for that if you plan to stick around there for a while, particularly in the afternoon."
46,2017-07-21,['hiking'],Started at the top and did about 2 miles of it then had to turn around because it was getting dark. On Monday I plan on hiking this entire thing & cant wait !  Did not gain a ton of elevation on the part I did which was the last 2 miles of the trail or so. Relatively easy & flat
47,2017-07-18,['mountain biking'],Great for newbie mountain bikers.
48,2017-07-16,['trail running'],Nice trail when you are looking for a relatively flat run
49,2017-07-07,['trail running'],"Really good, well worn trail and flat for most of it, so good for trail running but no much to look at."
50,2017-06-30,[''],This is a great a place to trail run!
51,2017-06-28,[''],"I was stoked for the trail, and was not let down!! Great incline and great views. CAUTION: the trail head sign mentioned that dogs are only permitted to be off leash for odd numbered dates. I.E if I went with my dog in the 2nd of any month, my dog would have to be on a leash. Bummer. Where is the dog trust?"
52,2017-06-27,['hiking'],"There are 4 trailheads starting from the bottom of Millcreek Canyon Road and heading up from which this trail can be accessed from: Rattlesnake Gulch, Church Fork, Burch Hollow, and Mount Aire.

I read on here that starting from Rattlesnake is quite steep and not very scenic. Since I started the hike quite late in the evening (7:30PM or so) I wanted something that I could easily do in and out. So I started from Church Fork.  Immediately you are placed in a very pretty trail, with lots of trees and greenery.  There is a waterfall at the trailhead which is cool too. Again, almost immediately you get amazing panoramic views of Millcreek Canyon.

I hiked from Church Fork to Burch Hollow.  It is 1.6 miles, plus 1.6 miles back. Super easy, not steep at all, most people and kids could do it.  I would have liked a bit more of a ""hike"", it felt more like a nature walk.  Lots of people trail running and mountain biking.  Dogs are allowed.

What's nice is you can do the trail in sections.  Since the sun was going down, I only did one small portion.  I would like to try another section of the trail very soon.  Also, Grandeur Peak can be accessed from the Church Fork trailhead.  I would like to try that as well. Supposedly it's a hard hike."
53,2017-06-25,['hiking'],Casually enjoyed part of this trail with a couple friends a few weeks ago.
54,2017-06-16,['trail running'],
55,2017-06-07,['trail running'],"I have trail run my whole life, and this is a Great trail to run on...just watch out for snakes!"
56,2017-06-06,[''],Great easy trail to run on once you get up to it.
57,2017-06-01,[''],"Definitely not easy, very difficult!"
58,2017-05-20,['trail running'],Loved it. Hit it as a running trail because it's half flat run half climb. This map goes into the canyon but once you finish the first incline you can go out of the canyon to get to overlook the valley.
59,2017-05-07,[''],The circuit is very good. A great experience.
60,2017-05-04,['hiking'],"As an over the road truck driver, I couldn't resist the beauty of the mountains drawing me in to discover more. This trail gives you a decent amount of exercise with a great reward at the end. The view is amazing and you can see the entire Salt Lake City Valley and go even further up. I love it so much up there."
61,2017-04-24,[''],it was a great day.
62,2017-04-19,[''],Fun with my dog on off leash day. I don't really understand why it's rated easy and rattlesnake is moderate? The first part of the pipeline trail is rattlesnake and it is uphill  also pipeline is a lot longer.
63,2017-04-16,['hiking'],"Took my dachshund and she loved it, then she napped all day once home."
64,2017-04-11,[''],"Great, quick and easy hike! Caught the sunset and then the moon coming up over the mountains on our way back down. It was a beautiful hike with beautiful company!"
65,2017-04-09,['hiking'],"We did this and Burch Hollow this morning in knee deep snow with the dogs. Pipeline is great for hiking, trail running, and biking. I'm particularly fond of in with the dogs in terrible weather because there is no one else on it and it's beautiful. This is a great easy trail in the canyon."
66,2017-03-29,['hiking'],I loved this trail! Hiked it on a rainy day
67,2017-03-09,[''],Loved this trail! So beautiful.
68,2017-01-21,['hiking'],Love this trail! Steady steep incline for a while then it flattens out. I saw a huge elk pass in front of me on the trail! I will do this hike again!
69,2016-11-14,['hiking'],Pipeline is one of the easiest trails in Millcreek. It's nice and easy for dogs. Good view at top and isn't a super long hike either.
70,2016-10-12,[''],Amazing hike that you have to have a lot of time to do. It is high elevation and in the Millcreek canyon so it costs $3 to get in so you pay on your way out. Intense elevation and dog friendly just keep them on leashes. Loved the views!
71,2016-09-11,['hiking'],"I used to go trail running on this trail all the time before work because it's close to the mouth of the canyon so it's easy to access. There are parts that get semi steep but it flattens out for a while. You can either fork left to the pipeline lookout, which looks out over the whole salt lake valley or go right to grandeur peak, which is a longer hike with steep inclines."
72,2016-09-05,['trail running'],"This is a nice hike if you want something relatively flat but out in the mountains.  There are several points where you can access it, so you can pick a section as long and flat as you like.  Also the last 1+ mi south of Rattlesnake gulch (not marked on this route) is nice and ends in an overlook of SL Valley."
73,2016-08-27,['hiking'],This was a great trail but I think it is more moderate than easy
74,2016-08-21,['hiking'],"Saturday morning and pretty crowded w hikers, bikers and runners... but very beautiful and I will do it again."
75,2016-07-24,[''],"I forgot to review when we did in July...it was difficult for me as I hadn't hiked in years, enjoyed shady places in between parts, strong breeze in turns around mountains which was refreshing after being so hot.  Hua Hua, Paul's little Chihuahua enjoyed and handled it well, needed a few lay down shady spot breaks but was a trooper"
76,2016-07-21,['hiking'],"The beginning was pretty tough but we are new to hiking, once you get past the steep uphill part of was pretty easy."
77,2016-06-28,[''],"Shaded, great view.... Perfect hike with kids"
78,2016-06-27,['hiking'],It was amazing. ;)
79,2016-06-06,[''],Fun hike. Great views of city/lake/valley
80,2016-06-02,[''],It was somewhat difficult in some parts. Very pretty.
81,2016-05-20,['hiking'],"Spring hike, entered from Chapel Fork picnic site. I need to remember to come back- great water to play in! Some good hills for the first 10-`15 minutes then leveled out. Mix of shady and sun. There were the occasional mountain bikers who were all very nice. It was an on-leash day and people abided by that. Also....not a ton of little bags left (and then forgotten)"
82,2016-05-19,['hiking'],Amaze! First time and won't be the last
83,2016-05-14,['hiking'],Great hike!!
84,2016-04-04,['hiking'],"At least 4 trailheads to start from (Rattlesnake Gulch, Church Fork. Burch Hollow, Mount Aire), so you can do it in sections. The Burch Hollow trailhead doesn't show up on All Trails, but it's the quickest/easiest access in the winter. During the summer, Mount Aire would be an easy access but is beyond the winter gate. During the winter, you have to walk up the Church Fork road to get to the trail. Burch Hollow towards Mount Aire is definitely the steepest section. The rest is very gentle. I came back via the closed road but there's still a foot of snow on the road in places and it is mushy right now."
85,2016-03-23,['hiking'],Beautiful and easy hike I did it with the baby on my back
86,2016-03-20,[''],"loved this trail, I will be back! I like that I can bring my dog!"
87,2016-03-14,[''],Good
88,2016-02-16,['hiking'],"The trail of turds. Average of one dog pile per square meter across the entire trail, nicely accented in their watery decay against the white snow background.  At one point, the smell was so bad my wife started to dry heave.  I honestly can't believe that other dog owners would be so incredibly inconsiderate."
89,2016-01-30,['hiking'],"This is a easy, beautiful walk. We were in the area and looking for a short hike to go on with our dog. It was good for walking our dog and for seeing the city. Great views of Salt Lake City from the entire trail, once you et above the tree line. Very peaceful walk and there weren't too many people when we went. We would do again."
90,2015-10-31,[''],"There are several spots you can access the pipeline, I chose Rattlesnake Gulch which for a biker is seemingly impossible at the peak.  Once on the trail though it was easy and fun, and my dog was able to keep up most of the time.   Church creek is in the middle which makes for a nice resting spot, however, I would recommend starting from the top of the trail (about 50 yards away from the Mt. Aire trailhead) if you want a more enjoyable ride the entire way."
91,2015-09-09,['trail running'],This was a really fun trail. Got to the pipeline trail from rattlesnake gulch and had a blast. Once you reach the pipeline trail it is very mellow and the views are amazing! Definitely doing this trail again!
92,2015-09-02,['trail running'],"I've hiked and run on a few different sections of this trail. It's fairly flat and not that scenic compared to other trails in Millcreek. However, at points, it offers nice views of the canyon, the valley, and wildflowers. Most of the parts that I've run haven't been shaded, so go on a cool day! If you're looking for something in Millcreek that is almost as flat, less busy, and has even better views, try the Great Western Trail/Wasatch Crest Trail network."
93,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"From Elbow Fork to Church Fork was tough for this beginning hiker, lots of steep ups and downs really worked the body and lungs. From Church Fork to the Lookout was amazing, so much to see and really flat. Did see a couple Rattlesnakes so be careful. "
94,2015-07-17,['trail running'],Great place for trail running in cloudy days during the summer. It is flat in many sections. There are some moderate elevation changes. Hikers do need to share with bikers.
95,2014-10-21,['mountain biking'],"Perfect for mountain biking when you don't feel like steep inclines. Nice very early in the morning before too many people show up. Please be courteous to all, human and canine, it is a popular hike. So much fun!"
96,2014-08-26,['mountain biking'],Amazing! Get dropped off at the top and live life to the fullest on the way down. Watch out for Dogs and hikers which can be plentiful during the busy season. It's also a great trail to bike at night during a full moon.
97,2014-06-23,['hiking'],"Great hike for early season due to the South facing slope.  Not very scenic unless you love scrub oak, with the exception about a mile or two from the top near Elbow Fork where the pines begin, otherwise, great trail for length (16.2 miles in 6 hours, 11 minutes).  Very flat throughout the whole length, with, as mentioned below, multiple access points.  --  This was a great accomplishment for me personally as I began my hiking lifestyle via Rattlesnake Gulch.  As we completed this March 9th, 2014, we did hit snow for the last 2 miles, which made the remaining return rather cold on the very aching feet. -- Looking forward to returning with snowshoes, oh, watch out for bicyclists!!!"
98,2014-05-25,['mountain biking'],An instant favorite! Flat enough that it's not strenuous but still plenty of fun. Really loose rock in some places and narrow but beginner-intermediate riders will do great!
99,2014-05-23,['hiking'],Only hiked a few miles of the upper section of the trail. Nice easy hike
100,2014-05-20,['hiking'],Good starter hike! The beginning is uphill with a rocky start but gets flatter. Once you reach the top you see an awesome view. I also bring my wiener dog and he can handle it!
101,2013-12-02,['hiking'],By far my favorite trail for snow shoeing and hiking. Easy to get too and great view of the Valley.
102,2013-08-27,['hiking'],"This is a relatively humdrum trail, but with a nice payoff at the end.  We stayed a while at the end to enjoy the view of the valley.  It's the best view of above the valley that I know of."
103,2013-07-30,['hiking'],Hot and practically no shade. Go in the morning. Trail more suitable for biking. Rather flat and boring to hike. Decent views of valley at the end of the trail. My dog nearly got bit by a rattlesnake so keep your furry friends close by.
104,2013-05-27,['hiking'],"fairly flat, but pretty long. plan to take more than just one 20 oz. water bottle, wear comfortable shoes, and take clothing for diverse weather conditions. great trail for hiking, mt. biking, and snowshoeing."
105,2013-02-10,['hiking'],"I absolutely LOVED this trail.  I'm from California and I can truly say there's no place like Utah for nature activities.  I wish we had parks like this one.  My dog loved running around freely (on an odd numbered day), meeting new friends, and I enjoyed the scenery and the hike.  The dog owners are very nice and approachable.  The park is VERY well maintained.  It sometimes becomes a bit steep, but it's worth it!"
106,2012-08-01,['hiking'],"Good trail for early season outings, gets a lot of sun so mostly dry. Heavily used by cyclists. Several different access points from the road allow you to take it in sections if you're not up for the whole 16 miles."
107,2012-04-23,['hiking'],"This is a good hike for most anyone. There are times when it is steep but not to bad. Mild hike for sure. It is shared between bikers and hikers. Everyone is courteous to others. The view is amazing. Very enjoyable hike.
