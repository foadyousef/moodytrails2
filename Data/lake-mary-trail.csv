1,2019-09-02,['hiking'],Awesome hike!!! Beautiful wildflowers and stunning lakes. Lake Mary even had manicure fish that will nibble on your fingers! Trail is well maintained and I’d defined recommend it!
2,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Easy hike, great views. Bugs were not bad with some bug spray. We did not see any wildlife other than chipmunks and gophers. Thankfully,  because the bear warnings are a little unnerving. Grabbed a burger at the base after. "
3,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Didn’t seem moderate to us (two adult women and a 15 year old), maybe an easy moderate. The fish in Mary lake will exfoliate your feet if that’s your thing. It’s now ours. "

5,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Great trail. It was a real effort for out little ones, but well worth it. "
6,2019-08-24,['hiking'],kinda short but great view 
7,2019-08-24,['hiking'],Beautiful! Lots of bugs 
8,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"absolutely beautiful. :) rocky and steep in some places, but not too bad. did this as a loop with Twin Lakes, the 3 sister lakes, and Dog Lake. made for a great day hike."
9,2019-08-23,['hiking'],Fun easy hike. Great for kids
10,2019-08-19,['hiking'],Hardly any shade and way too crowded. Pretty wildflowers though!
11,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Despite the rough ski slope at the beginning of the trail, Lake Mary was amazing!  Lots of good views and the lake itself was super nice and awesome. Me and my buddy came across several squirrels and chipmunks, which was awesome haha!  Lots of people were at the trail today (Saturday, August 17, 2019)! "
12,2019-08-15,['hiking'],"Well, this time, we didn’t hike all the way up. We saw a mama moose and little baby moose. So we just watched them for an hour"
13,2019-08-13,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",
14,2019-08-10,['hiking'],Nice. Easy to moderate hike. a few wild flowers along the way. last couple hundred yards of the trail were wet. fairly popular today.
15,2019-08-07,['hiking'],"So beautiful!! My first ever hike, and the climb was well worth it!"
16,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
17,2019-08-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful views. (a bit steep for a beginner hiker, but still doable.) a bit of rock climbing on part of the upper trail to the lake."
18,2019-07-31,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","I love the hike to Lake Mary! There are so many beautiful views. There are a few steep spots (IMO) but a very short hike to a beautiful lake. There are some very rocky areas with some small water flow, so it makes the rocks slippery. For me, it made going back down a challenge. Also because there is so much water (and a good size spot of standing water), the mosquitoes were thick. We went during the evening hours to avoid the heat but in turn got swarmed with the mosquitoes. I would highly recommend going in late morning/afternoon to avoid the bugs."
19,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"The path is very wide at the bottom and kind of on a ski run. If you go past where the recording shows in All Trails, make sure to mark your path. I went to lake Catherine from the trail but then could not find my way back and ended up bush whacking and rock climbing around the perimeter of Lake Mary until I found the trail again. There is also a warning about an aggressive bear in the area. "
20,2019-07-29,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Saw a moose at Dog Lake in the distance. Nice hike especially in the morning. Small rock hopping over the stream near Lake Mary. Bring and wear bug spray!
21,2019-07-29,['hiking'],Great! 
22,2019-07-29,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Bring Bug spray and you will be fine. Took about an hour to hike up to Lake Mary and that was with several stops. The lake is gorgeous and totally worth the climb.
23,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Very good hiking trail
24,2019-07-26,['hiking'],Great trail
25,2019-07-24,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! But wear mosquito repellent! 
26,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Great trial, you’re gonna want to douse yourself in mosquito spray tho, like no joke, you need like military grade mosquito spray, especially at the top near the lake"
27,2019-07-20,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
28,2019-07-20,['hiking'],Great family hike.
29,2019-07-17,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite trails. There are moose near the lakes frequently. The trail is pretty easy and it usually takes me just a couple hours round trip (and I’m a slow hiker). I would recommend going all the way up to lake Catherine. You could put a hammock up and hang out for a while. 
30,2019-07-16,['hiking'],"***HEADS UP-RECENT BEAR SIGHTING***
I saw a warning on social media and thought I’d share since no ones mentioned it yet. Bear sighting on this trail recently and there’s a warning posted on the board at the beginning of the hike. It was reported to have followed hikers at dusk. Take your bear spray. "
31,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'snow']","Did this July 1st. Signs aren’t great, but we figured it out. Some scrambling. Some snow, but I did it in tennis shoes. If you hike up to the right of the dam, you can actually hike around the lake for a bit. Lake is gorgeous and still had chunks of ice. Many ground squirrels. "
32,2019-07-15,['hiking'],Stunning trail up to Lake Mary. We’ve hiked it 3x in the last month and seen the trail go from snow covered 1/2 way up to mostly clear now. My 4 yr old son loved it. Definitely worth a hike. We’re headed up there again today to see if my son can make it to Lake Martha 
33,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","This trail is beautiful, but still has some snow. I took my snow spikes and was happy I did because the snowy spots were a little slippery. There’s mud too, BUT STILL SO BEAUTIFUL! Make sure you go to all three lakes. The most snow is on the way to Lake Catherine. 10/10 would hike again "
34,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"Once the snow melts and the flowers bloom this is a gorgeous hike. Until that point it can be kind of drab. So for example in 2019 we had snow longer than usual into the summer on this trail and it was sorta crappy until maybe the end of July. Good for kids, I took my 7 year old on this hike at 4, 5 and 6 without issues. "
35,2019-07-11,['hiking'],Did the hike on 7/11. I really struggled with shortness of breath and maybe feeling some effects of altitude sickness with headache and nausea. We hiked to Lake Martha and back and it was a total of 5 miles RT. It took us 3 1/2 hours with rest stops.
36,2019-07-10,['hiking'],"Once you accept that half trail is basically a neutered ski run, you may enjoy the hike. Lake Mary itself is a spectacular spot once you reach it. Trail is very busy. "
37,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","There are still spots of snow and mud on the trail, but it isn’t too bad. The views of the lake are beautiful and if you go Wednesday through Sunday you can grab a burger and a beer at the patio at the base of the trail. @journeysandgrub"
38,2019-07-07,['hiking'],Great hike. The first 20 mins are the worst. 
39,2019-07-07,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Absolutely gorgeous! 
40,2019-07-06,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","The trailhead actually has a very large rock at the entrance which makes it look like it's not the entrance, but it is. It's paved in gravel for the first few feet. Mostly well kept otherwise. Only a little bit of snow and not too muddy at all. At the end, you will need to scramble a bit over river rocks so your expect that your shoes might get wet. We went on July 5 at 8am and it was cool clear sunny dry weather, starting the day around 60 degrees and ending around 73. 50% shade up and down. "
41,2019-07-04,['hiking'],"Did this hike today - loved it! There is still quite a bit of snow, and some muddy areas.  I was a little confused about where the trailhead was, but following the map on this app kept us going in the right direction. "
42,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'snow']","This is a pretty easy trail but many parts are still covered with six to seven inches of snow. Other parts are muddy because of the snow melt. My wife and kids all made it in tennis shoes, though they slid and slipped on the snow a few times."
43,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"still a fair amount of snow, but nothing good shoes, poles or spikes can't remedy."
44,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'snow']",Beautiful views! Prepare to walk in snow and mud as there is still a good amount on the trail. We wanted to do the look and check out Twin Lakes but too much snow on that trail so turned around. 
45,2019-06-27,"['hiking', 'snow']","Great trail, still covered in snow with some deeper areas and steep spots easy to slip on. Great view of the partially frozen lake!!"
46,2019-06-27,['hiking'],"I hiked this a couple of days ago and there was snow everywhere. It was amazing! Once you made it to the top, it could not have a better view!"
47,2019-06-15,"['snowshoeing', 'snow']",6/15/19  a bit snowy. 2-3ft most places. lake partially frozen. 
48,2019-06-11,['hiking'],A beautiful hike. Great views of Brighton and a quick glimpse at Lake Mary. Mosquitos are legit but bug spray will save the day!
49,2019-05-18,['backpacking'],
50,2019-05-15,['hiking'],Not recommended in May when there’s still snow pact. Made for a very difficult hike. The lake was still frozen.
51,2019-05-06,"['hiking', 'snow']",
52,2018-12-17,['snowshoeing'],"Not the hike we expected. ""Best used"" through October is more than a suggestion. Once Brighton resort is open for the season, hikers need to take the ""uphill route"" on Milly Access / Lost Maid and then exit the Wren Hollow gate to out of bounds. We looped around Dog Lake and made it up to the overlook of Lake Mary. Didn't have any backcountry gear/beacons and definitely would have wanted them if we were to go any farther towards Lake Catherine."
53,2018-11-14,[''],"I got plastered by artificial snow makers trying to find the trailhead by the Brighton Ski resort, but once found it was a great hike! It was fairly quick, even with the snowfall on the ground. I loved skipping rocks on the frozen lake and hearing those cool Star Wars noises."
54,2018-11-09,['hiking'],"Did this trail yesterday, it hard to follow the trail with the recent snowfall and quite slippery due to icy areas, but worth the challenge and inspiration for capturing both visually and mentally the solitude of this area. Simply beautiful."
55,2018-11-04,['hiking'],"Great hike, really beautiful.  3-6 inches of snow and lightly snowing all day.  Well worth the uphill climb."
56,2018-10-21,[''],"Nice hike and surprised to find it completely snow covered in late October. The snow made it even more fun, and the trail was still easy to follow."
57,2018-10-14,['hiking'],Hiked this on Thursday. Great quick hike after work around sunset.
58,2018-10-13,['hiking'],"Moderate climb to get to Lake Mary, but well worth it. We did this about 3 weeks ago when the colors were turning and it was absolutely breathtaking. If you have the time, hike around to the backside of the lake which is less crowded - you can keep going on <0.5 miles more and you will hit the second lake. Beautiful hike, though tends to be popular and a little overcrowded at peak times."
59,2018-10-11,['hiking'],"Super easy, but well worth it. Just a fun hike."
60,2018-10-06,['hiking'],Breathtaking! Fortunate to hike this right after the first snowfall of the season. Pretty fabulous for low landers from the Tampa Bay Area!
61,2018-09-16,[''],Great hike. Beautiful relaxing spot when you get to Lake Mary.
62,2018-09-14,[''],Beautiful stop on the way to lake Catherine.
63,2018-09-12,[''],"Pretty steep until you get to the first lake, but it’s worth it!"
64,2018-09-03,[''],The getting to is HARD! It was really steep for a lot of the time up but the destination made it worth it. Lake Mary is very beautiful.
65,2018-09-02,[''],My favorite hike. I’ve hiked much harder trails and much easier trails but for some reason I keep coming back to this one when I think about my favorite one. My kids and I hike it at least twice a Summer. It is an extremely beautiful lake. Amazing wildflowers and lots of chipmunks and squirrels. We saw a marmot up there once as well. We eat lunch by the lake and let the kids good off and are always back before lunch.
66,2018-09-01,[''],Epic
67,2018-08-27,[''],incredible views.
68,2018-08-21,['hiking'],love the fact that you can be in such a crowded place and find such solitude within just a few minutes of hiking. fish were small (5 inches or so) but this hike and lake Catherine just above it were phenomenal. I'd love to go back again when there aren't so many people on the trail tho. I had to stop quite a few times to let big groups pass by and it was just myself. great hike tho and some very beautiful scenery.
69,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"Decided to do this hike with my two boys (8 and 10) after camping at the Spruces the night before.  The boys complained about the incline going up from Brighton, but overall it really wasn't bad and was a great hike that I knew my boys could survive."
70,2018-08-19,['hiking'],
71,2018-08-17,[''],great hike a little difficult for a beginner like me had to stop quite a bit to catch my breath and i also forgot the bug spray if you hike this Trail you're definitely going to need bug spray for all the mosquitoes... But once we reach the lake it was all worth it so beautiful up there
72,2018-08-17,[''],"Gorgeous water, beautiful wildflowers!"
73,2018-08-14,['hiking'],"Saw 5 different moose, a porcupine, and lots of deer! We started at the trail head at 530 AM ! Got to the top around 630 AM and watched the sunrise ! This is my favorite hike ever! So beautiful! Accurately labeled moderate! "
74,2018-08-13,['bird watching'],"We hit the trail around 8:45am and saw a smattering of people now and then. This has lovely views on the climb, with lots of wild flowers and the lake is peaceful when loud talking people are not there. Why do people talk so loud? On the way down we stopped at Dog Lake which is small and more peaceful. We spotted a moose couple near the end of the hike which made our day; we couldn't miss them they crossed the trail."
75,2018-08-12,['nature trips'],Gorgeous. Loved every minute! It was a great day for hiking too!
76,2018-08-12,[''],"Steep for beginners like me, but gorgeous. Lovely lake! Please be courteous and remember that swimming is not permitted."
77,2018-08-11,['hiking'],It’s really pretty worth the hike ...the only problem today was all that SMOKE !
78,2018-08-10,['hiking'],"I wish we had gotten to the trail earlier in the morning!  It was about 10am when we started, and the sun really beats down on the first section, making 67 degrees feel like 85.  Plus, there were quite a few people on the trail.  But the trail is beautiful and Lake Mary is gorgeous.  And since it’s so big and many hikers continue to Lake Martha and Lake Catherine, it felt like we had the place to ourselves.  I know people love Cecret Lake at the top of Lil’ Cottonwood Canyon (I do in too when the wildflowers are in full bloom), but this lake it WAY prettier.  Can’t wait to go back and do Martha and Catherine too next time!  My kids (15,12,10,8) enjoyed this one too, though they didn’t like all the people on the trail.  I can’t figure out where they got their disdain for crowds...oh, wait..."
79,2018-08-10,[''],"We saw a moose!  We also saw deer, pika, and chipmunks.  When you get to the lake head left and go over the boulder and then head away from lake. There is another hidden lake and that’s where the moose are."
80,2018-08-09,['hiking'],"Went after lunch, not too crowded, lovely waterfalls and rock formations along the way with the reward of beautiful Lake Mary. Highly recommend."
81,2018-08-03,['hiking'],Most beautiful trail.  Definitely a favorite.
82,2018-07-30,[''],Gorgeous. One of my absolute favorites! Be sure to explore the side trails!!
83,2018-07-29,['hiking'],First part of trail up the ski run is the toughest. After that less steep and shade
84,2018-07-29,['hiking'],Great family hike with my 12 and 15 yr olds.   Lots of places to sit and have a break at the lake.  Will do this hike again!
85,2018-07-27,['hiking'],"Perfect kid hike. Go during the week and you can avoid a lot of the crowds. Bring bug spray. If you want a little more challenge, head to Martha and Catherine."
86,2018-07-27,['hiking'],"I hiked up to Twin lakes and then cut over to Lake Mary. There was a moose along the way that was pretty cool. The trail in between Twin Lakes and Lake Mary was very empty. There was only two other people I saw along the way. The whole loop, parking at Silver lake, then up to twin lakes, then across to Lake Mary, then down the lake Mary trail head was 5.5 miles exactly."
87,2018-07-26,[''],Great Hike. Perfect place for lunch at the lake. Took girls 14-19. They liked it but was a little steep for them at first. It is a true uphill/downhill trail with great scenery at the top.
88,2018-07-21,[''],"Steep, beautiful, lots of gorgeous wildflowers, lots of fellow hikers. My kids (11, 9, 7, 4, and 18 months) loved it. Not really shaded."
89,2018-07-20,[''],So freaking beautiful! Bring big spray. tons of wild flowers and wild life and medicinal herbs! The lake is spectacular!
90,2018-07-17,['hiking'],Definitely one of my favorite hikes. Its beautiful and adventurous.
91,2018-07-15,[''],We went in the evening and saw a moose! Beautiful hike with incredible views the whole way.
92,2018-07-15,['hiking'],One of my favorite quick hikes. We started late afternoon around 7 we got to lake Mary then kept going to Lake Martha and saw 4 Bull Moose!!! It was amazing! Then on the way down we ran into another one walking in front of us on the trail just before Dog lake.
93,2018-07-14,[''],"For a bit longer hike and some great views, start at Silver Lake, up to Twin Lakes, and then over to Lake Mary. From there, out to the trailhead. It’s a quick road walk back to the Silver Lake parking. This provides a nice loop of about 4 miles and adds in some great views between Lake Mary and Twin Lakes."
94,2018-07-12,['hiking'],"Views are beautiful and the flowers are stunning as you walk up the trail. However, we went around 7pm and there were so many bugs we had to start running down. Three of us went on the hike and ended with at least 10 mosquito bites a piece. Might be worth it to endure the heat rather than a night hike, but still my favorite view."
95,2018-07-11,[''],This hike is not anything close to being as enjoyable as  it used to be.  The first two thirds of the gradual winding elevation following a babbling brook and shaded by tall pine trees has been blocked and rerouted to a miserable straight up the hill (providing no Sun) path looking more like a Jeep road than a hiking trail.  Very ugly and very disappointing.  My heart  sank when I saw what they had done.  We had a large family group of all ages and it was still doable but too much now is a climb of little satisfaction.
96,2018-07-08,['hiking'],"Fun hike, took boys 4 and 10. They completed with some motivation along the way.  There are steep rocky parts but not too bad. I would say lots of mosquitoes so plan for that, and wish people wouldn’t feed the wildlife the chipmunks are too friendly. Beautiful view!! ♥️"
97,2018-07-06,['hiking'],"Nice, easily marked hike through the ski mountain. Some minor rock climbing at parts. Great view at top of the lake. There definitely are quite a few mosquitos up around the lake, may vary on the day/weather, but around 4pm on a sunny day we ran into a bunch - plan accordingly."

100,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"My kids 7,8,11,12,12 did great on this uphill. Beautiful hike for the family."
101,2018-06-29,[''],i saw a moose and a chipmunk took a snack from my hand. 10/10
102,2018-06-26,[''],My favorite lake to hike to in Utah. The prettiest view. Easy up and down. Bring a hammock and stay a while.
103,2018-06-19,['hiking'],"If the drive through the canyon up to this trail doesn’t take your breath away, then the views from the lake and the trail itself absolutely will. Went up this hike around 6PM last night, and there were very few people on the trail. I recommend bringing a sweater or a light jacket as it is pretty well shaded by trees and the surrounding mountains. Ran into one small patch of snow on the way up and a little bit of mud, but the trail is very clear right now. I would also suggest bringing bug spray as there are quite a few bugs around the water. The trail is a little steep at parts, but it really is not very difficult. Took me about an hour and a half to get up and down, not including the time I spent by the lake. Very easy to get to Lake Catherine and Dog Lake from this trail. Highly recommend this hike for any skill level."
104,2018-06-17,['hiking'],"Hiked up here for sunrise and the trail is 99% snow free. A few patches here and there but they are easily avoidable. A little bit of mud and the last little climb up to the lake has some runoff, but an overall great condition. Lots of mosquitoes at the lake though, which was the only downside."
105,2018-06-15,[''],"No snow on the trail. People swimming, though it's a watershed and clearly marked. I've done this hike so many times over the past few years and it is getting really crowded. Please leave your vapes and blaring music home and pack your trash out. Most of us are hiking to get away from these things."
106,2018-06-11,['hiking'],"I have loved this trail for years. I've seen some people swimming in the lake, despite the watershed rules. Just out of curiosity, has anyone been cited for doing so? I wonder how regularly this happens. Love this easy trail that is close to home."
107,2018-06-11,[''],"Those that said this trail is covered in snow/ice till July is lying. We did this hike yesterday with only about two small patches of snow on the entire hike. Almost didn’t go to the hike, was glad I didn’t trust the false reviews. Beautiful hike!"
108,2018-06-11,['hiking'],Such a beautiful hike! We did all three lakes. There were some patches of snow closer to Lake Catherine but wasn’t bad at all. I did it in Nike tennis shoes.
109,2018-06-11,[''],"Loved this hike! There was some snow towards the end, but not too bad. Totally worth it! The lake is beautiful!"
110,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"My family and I did this hike on Sunday, June 10.  We almost didn’t go because the report from a few weeks back said that the trail was impassable from snow. I think the warm weather changed things quickly. 

The trail from Brighton (majestic lift) to Lake Mary was completely clear. To me, the beginning of the hike was a little boring (when still on ski runs). But quickly it ascends into a wilderness trail that was much more interesting. 

The lake is damned with a man made structure. There is one point on the hike when the damn looms heavily in front of the hiker. This part is “ugly” — but it only lasts a short while then you are back to beautiful nature. 

From Mary on up to Catherine had a lot more snow. But it was passable with normal equipment and just a little bit of care. I had hiking poles with me and was glad. (But then I love my poles). 

Lake Catherine was a great spot for picnic lunch."
111,2018-05-26,[''],Love this trail. Beautiful view!
112,2018-05-26,[''],Yup
113,2018-05-25,['hiking'],THIS TRAIL IS COMPLETELY INACCESSIBILE UNTIL JULY.  It's not just snowy and icy - you can't get there unless you're on skis. Fair warning 
114,2018-04-28,[''],From the other reviews ill say this is a great trail... unfortunately I didn't get to do it because its still snow covered and snow shoes will be required at this time.  I just moved from Florida to UT and don't yet have them. :)
115,2018-02-06,['hiking'],"Easily one of my favorite hikes. It doesn’t take a long time to get there, it’s not too hard, there are lots of places to hammock when you get there, and the lake is so beautiful and clear! I love going up there to relax and enjoy the pretty view :)"
116,2017-11-24,['hiking'],"I was disappointed in this trail.  The pictures made it look like a pristine lake in the mountains, when in fact it is dammed up, and you’re looking at ski lifts and related equipment the entire time.  Also, although it is a fairly short hike, the trail is steep all the way."
117,2017-11-12,[''],"11/11/2017... 3-5inch snow cover,  some icy areas, microspikes and poles are probably useful. GORGEOUS!"
118,2017-11-06,[''],Great hike for Cardio. The lake at the top is beautiful!
119,2017-10-10,['hiking'],"Fairly easy and beautiful hike. I would highly recommend even for beginners. When I went I saw quite a few older hikers and even hikers carrying small kids on their backs. So bring your family or friends along for this one!

Went around August and the weather and scenery was perfect. Bring a good camera or make sure your phone battery is charged because you'll want to take a lot of pictures. 

My only complaint about the trail is how skinny it is, and it doesn't help that it's a relatively high trafficked trail."
120,2017-10-03,[''],"Short and easy hike, best done early morning before the trail gets too crowded and while the deer and moose are grazing.  It's great to continue on the trail up to Lakes Martha and Catherine."
121,2017-10-03,['hiking'],"Great hike! Pretty steep at first, but the lake is worth it. Even saw a few moose :)"
122,2017-09-20,[''],"Nice hike. The first bit is a bit steep, but not rocky and easy to navigate. I just took my time. The lake is really pretty too, but you can't swim in it. :("
123,2017-09-16,['hiking'],"Went Saturday morning starting around 9 am. As we were coming back down around 10:30 there were a lot of people, so I would recommend going earlier or during the week! Very steep and difficult for a not very experienced hiker, it was definitely moderate for us! A tiny bit of frost, no snow yet. Bring a jacket!"
124,2017-09-11,['hiking'],"This trail was a bit disappointing. I would say it is heavily trafficked, and part of the trail is a steep climb up a little creek. The rocks were wet and slippery. I'm glad I had my pole with me or I'd have twisted an ankle. A lot of people. Was hoping for a bit less, though most everyone we encountered was pleasant. Not a long trail but if you keep going, there's another lake another mile away? That is, if you can scale a mountain or jump 5 feet across and manage not to land on Lake Mary below you. We had to turn around. It seemed too risky to keep going."
125,2017-09-11,['hiking'],This was only our third hike since moving to SLC. Each one gets better. Be sure to notice the aspen grove on the side of the mountain on the way up close to the beginning. They are just starting to turn golden. Lake Mary is a nice place to just sit after the hike. Great day!!
126,2017-09-10,[''],Loved this hike! The lake is beautiful! There were a lot of people on the trail which was the only drawback. Maybe hiking during the week or on Sunday would be better.
127,2017-09-09,[''],"Beautiful lake! The hike itself was tough at the beginning, but it is definitely worth it."
128,2017-09-05,['hiking'],"I'm suprised this was ratted moderate. Although there are a couple of steep parts, it's pretty short! We went up on a Thursday afternoon and it was lovley! Very few other people. Iwas carring my 18 month old and it took us about an hour to get to the lake.  So I'm sure if you're not carrying a thrashing child, you could do it way quicker! the chipmunks at the lake are really aggressive so obviously, do your best to keep crumbs away from them and HOLD all of your food! I had one steal my granola bar from under my leg! ☹ Obviously, it's a beautiful view and a place I'll definitely recommend to people traveling who need a short hike!"
129,2017-08-30,['hiking'],I love this trail to take my kids! We went up to Lake Martha tonight as well and saw a huge bull moose! gorgeous sunset hike!
130,2017-08-27,['hiking'],
131,2017-08-12,[''],Trailhead is by the Brighton Center just up the hill a bit. It's a bit steep but the wild flowers take your mind off of that. The trail has a creek bed that you have to go up but it's not bad. The lake is absolutely stunning. We saw a moose across the lake that was beautiful. Hike around to get different views of the lake. They are worth it. Next time we will continue on to Lake Catherine.
132,2017-08-08,['hiking'],"Lake Mary beautiful! If you keep going you'll hit lake Catherine. There are a large cluster of rocks on the way to Lake Catherine (right before the fork), it's worth climbing them for a panoramic view. Keep en eye out for moose, we saw a couple!"
133,2017-08-08,['hiking'],"Absolutely one of my favorite trails. Lake Mary is stunning. Easy hike from Brighton Ski Resort. Continue past Lake Mary to see Martha and Catherine. On your way down, take a left to Twin Lakes. Also visit Silver Lake across the main parking lot."
134,2017-08-08,[''],One of my favorite trails.
135,2017-08-07,[''],Great wildlife and awesome views.
136,2017-08-06,[''],Awesome hike! Wildflowers everywhere.
137,2017-08-06,[''],"Wild flowers are gorgeous, was a fairly busy trail, family friendly but definitely uphill to get to the lake."
138,2017-08-01,[''],"Flowers are out, and in full bloom! Make sure to bring and wear mosquito repellent."
139,2017-07-30,[''],Great trail. A little steep but my 7 year old and I made it. It was a wonderful hike.
140,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! We got to the trailhead about 8:45 a.m. and there were already quite a few hikers on the trail. It was 56 degrees which felt heavenly after the heat in the valley. It was a steep hike, but it wasn't too long. The lake was gorgeous. I would definitely do this again!"
141,2017-07-29,[''],Easy and not busy trail. Beautiful lake at the end. Will do it again
142,2017-07-29,['hiking'],Gorgeous! The wildflowers are incredible right now! A steep hike the entire way but worth it. Will hike this again.
143,2017-07-29,['hiking'],Wonderful hike just made it to the top. Have three kids under six we made it but at top a little challenging
144,2017-07-29,[''],Beautiful hike. Uphill the whole way so coming back was nice. Loved the wildflowers and the lake was gorgeous. Near the end the trail has water flowing down it so wear appropriate shoes. Brooklynn had to be carried part of the way.
145,2017-07-27,[''],Beautiful
146,2017-07-27,['hiking'],"A short hike up with a little bit of a scramble towards the top. Amazing lake views and saw a huge bull Moose on the trail by Crest Express lift. Bring bug spray! Mosquitos were out in force at 5:30pm, thankfully a generous hiker lended some to us."
147,2017-07-26,['hiking'],"Mosquitoes and more mosquitoes, but other wise pretty and pretty."
148,2017-07-25,['hiking'],"SHORT, SWEET and BEAUTIFUL!! Pack a lunch, take a swimsuit, tree hammock and friends (even fury ones!) 

Parking is tricky, be patient people are coming and going often enough."
149,2017-07-25,['hiking'],"This was an amazing hike with my three oldest kids (4, 6, and 9).  Wildflowers were everywhere and the lake itself was beautiful and serene.  The last 200 yards or so are a bit slick and require some caution with young children to avoid skinned knees etc..  Otherwise this is a very family-friendly and enjoyable hike."
150,2017-07-23,['hiking'],"One of the prettiest hikes I've been on! The wildflowers are gorgeous, as is the lake itself. A little steep and rocky in some spots but I took a 4 year old and 6 year old and they managed just fine."
151,2017-07-23,[''],Easy hike. Great views.
152,2017-07-19,['hiking'],Absolutely gorgeous hike. The wildflowers seem to be just about in full bloom. Came up on a moose by the trail heading up just before Lake Mary. The first part of the hike is a little bit of elevation gain (I'm from sea level so I huffed & puffed) but nothing crazy.
153,2017-07-18,['hiking'],nice short hike.
154,2017-07-14,['hiking'],Such a beautiful lake! The hike is up hill and rocky in some areas but it's worth it. Sunscreen and bug spray is a must. The trail is shaded in some spots but the majority is in direct sun. We got there around 11 on a weekday and there were very few people. The mosquitos weren't bad but a couple hours later on the way down the trail they were quite numerous.
155,2017-07-11,['backpacking'],"Go early as it can be insanely busy, especially during hot days. I've done this one quite a few times as a fast after-work-camping-fix on a Friday trip, but many more times while on my way to Tuscarora, Wolverine or Sunset Peak."
156,2017-07-08,['hiking'],"We did this trail in early July. The wildflowers were not quite in full bloom yet. Lake Mary was a nice payoff despite the large concrete dam. We continued on to summit Sunset Peak, which I would highly recommend for its 360 degree vista. 5 stars for that."
157,2017-07-04,[''],Keep going
158,2017-07-03,[''],Nice trail but plan on getting your feet wet in the spring until mid summer.
159,2017-07-03,['hiking'],"Long up hill, crowded and very enjoyable.   You can't beat the view."
160,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"Trailhead was tricky to find but once you start and arrive at the like, it's awesome. Go early. I got there at 7 and has the trails all to myself. By the time I left which was around 1030, the trail was consistently busy. I'll be posting pics on my Instagram: 5050luck"
161,2017-07-01,['hiking'],Busy trail but beautiful lakes.  Some Flowers are blooming.
162,2017-07-01,[''],If you can catch the wild flowers in full bloom on this hike then you are in for a treat! The only downside to this hike is it's highly trafficked during peak season.
163,2017-07-01,['hiking'],"The lake was gorgeous! It was a good quick hike, but steep enough to get the heart pumping!"
164,2017-06-29,[''],"More like 2.5 miles out and back, but amazing nevertheless"
165,2017-06-27,['hiking'],"Still some snow along the trail, but my husband and I both wore chacos and made it up fine. Beautiful today."
166,2017-06-25,['hiking'],Good family hike. 5 and 9 year old
167,2017-06-25,[''],Beautiful hike. Dig it.
168,2017-06-25,[''],
169,2017-06-24,[''],"It was a little too early in the season so there is still alot of snow.we couldn't make it over the ridge to see lake Catherine. 
We will be back in August!"
170,2017-06-23,[''],"Gorgeous! Still a bit snowy, but manageable."
171,2017-06-22,[''],"The destination is the reward! My wife and I took our two boys (8 & 6) on this hike. The trail was hard to find at times, but there was a steady (not heavy) bit of traffic to help lead the way. The boys complained a little, but nothing major. Be aware that even in mid June there is still a good bit of snow to traverse, so wear good water resistant hiking shoes/boots with traction. Also, I would recommend wearing clothes that you are not scared to get dirty because this is not some leisurely well-beaten path. There is some climbing (and falling!) involved.

The best part was the view at the end! Since we have been in Utah, we have gone to Bryce and Dinosaur National, but my wife said the Lake Mary was the most beautiful thing we have seen here."
172,2017-06-20,['hiking'],"Great little hike. About 2 miles round trip starting from Brighton Lodge's parking lot. Steeper than it looks, so great cardio! Beautiful views from the rock ledges up by the lake. In June the lake was still partially frozen over. Made for a pretty view. Great afternoon hike!"
173,2017-06-11,[''],"Fun hike but today, June 10, 2017, there was still quite a bit of snow and the majority of the lake was still frozen.  However, it was beautiful and perfect hiking weather."
174,2017-06-11,[''],Quick and  beautiful hike!
175,2017-06-10,['hiking'],Quick hike to beautiful lakes and this hike is kid friendly.
176,2017-04-23,['hiking'],This is my all time favorite trail. It fairly challenging but so rewarding.
177,2017-02-28,['snowshoeing'],"Beautiful hike on snowshoes. After hiking up through the Brighton ski runs on the far right side, we cut off to head over to the lake. Once we got past where the skiers tracks ended (for the out of bound skiers) we had to make our own trail. It was a great workout and absolutely beautiful!"
178,2017-02-26,['snowshoeing'],"I love this hike. I did it once last summer and again a week ago and I have to say that I think I prefer it in the winter. You have to start by hiking up some of the ski slopes at Brighton, so watch out for all the people coming down. It also gets fairly steep, but it's not long before you are off the slopes and it levels out a bit. You will get some of the most beautiful snowy views of the mountains up at the top. I could have spent all day staring at those mountains. Love!!!"
179,2017-02-01,['hiking'],"the trail was forgiving even with its few steeper inclines, we had many opportunities to stop and take pictures alone the way and we become fascinated with all of the big rocks to clime and some pretty big ants that roamed around them, there was even a waterfall that we had the privilege to make a stop at along the way!
      Once we arrived to Lake Mary a portion of our group crossed a line of stepping stones to relaxed in the sun on a series of rock that protruded from the lake (perfect place for lunch!) and the rest of the group hiked around the lake and climbed on the rocks on the other side and even took part in a snow fight. The weather was great and the snow here and there was an amazing why to cool off."
180,2016-12-17,[''],"One of my favorites, I go here at least three times each summer. The lake was half dried up when I went in August but other than that lake Mary has beautiful views and is a nice place to take your friends and family for a rewarding hike!"
181,2016-10-24,['hiking'],One of my all time favorites
182,2016-10-22,['trail running'],The trail itself is beautiful but crowded. We continued to on to Lake Catherine. Lake Mary seemed to be nearly dried up.
183,2016-10-13,['hiking'],"This is a great short (but not too short) hike up to one of my favorite lakes. I have yet to go further to Lake Martha or Lake Catherine, though that's definitely on the to do list. I've hiked this trail on super hot summer days and in snow, but I especially enjoy it in spring/early summer when the wild flowers are in bloom. Plenty of rocks to relax on and enjoy a rest while overlooking the lake."
184,2016-09-30,[''],I haven't been yet... but it's amazing!
185,2016-09-26,['hiking'],"There was a lot more snow than I was expecting. I thought maybe a light snowfall. It was, however, very fun, incredibly beautiful, and worth the time."
186,2016-09-26,['hiking'],A relatively gentle trail to Lake Mary. We entered on the Brighton side. Once you reach the lake there are a number of options if you choose to proceed; we went up towards Millicent Peak which was quite a climb and a lot of serious bouldering. Unfortunately couldn't make it to the top on account of the snow.
187,2016-09-18,[''],easy trail. very beautiful! interesting photos.
188,2016-09-08,['hiking'],2 miles seemed like an overestimate. It took about 45 min. to finish.
189,2016-09-05,[''],"We went Labor Day, so naturally there's going to be a ton of people. The first half of this hike is pretty steep. They drained the dam/ lake so it wasn't that pretty. I'm sure it's beautiful when it's full. The first half is pretty open-- you are hiking right next to ski lifts. I liked the second half more as it is more shaded. This hike would have been better if people would learn to be quite on hikes instead of talking loudly to their group. Be quite on hikes, people! Don't ruin it for everyone else!"
190,2016-09-01,['hiking'],"This is my first review. I have to say that I was inspired to write this review after this hike. All trails thus far have all been so exceptional that I haven't felt compelled to write more than ""that was amazingly perfect"" on every hike.....until this one. I really, REALLY didn't like this hike. For me, a good hike has certain criteria including somewhat of seclusion. This hike literally weaves in and out of chair lifts for the first 1/2 or so. There are street lights on the trail. The trail is as wide as a street in some parts. I didn't like it. The views were of the back of a ski resort, near the top. The lake was empty. It was cool to see lots of moose, but that made the hike somewhat scary with a three year old. There is a giant dam you have to walk around to get to the dry lake....so disappointing for a baby that fought his way uphill to see ""a lake, mama"". This hike is great for you if you like to be out in the wide open where everyone can see you hiking and you can see all of them. You can see the whole ski resort, all the buildings, all the snow machines, street lights, etc. Super un-magical and un-secluded. Great for casual hikes if you want to feel more safe, though. You never feel alone. You never feel in the ""woods"". :-)"
191,2016-08-27,['hiking'],"Fun, easy hike. As others noted, the lake is mostly drained, but the mountains are always pretty and you can hike across the lake now so that's different. If you play Pokemon Go and aren't opposed to tech on trails, you can even catch water Pokemon here (haha!)"
192,2016-08-23,[''],"Pretty views, the dam is empty leaving part of lake Mary dry. Keep going towards Katherine! Lots of moose on the trail too!"
193,2016-08-21,[''],So many people on the trail. At least fifty people at the lake when I arrived.
194,2016-08-18,['hiking'],"Lake Mary is drained out but we continued the hike up to Lake Catherine and we are so glad we did. We encounter severall wildlife animals (Deer, Moose, all kinds of birds, flowers, etc.) and the views are spectacular. Lake Martha is between Lake Mary and Lake Catherine and it's the prettiest of the three. The hike is moderate. I recommend you start early as on our way down there was a lot of traffic going up."
195,2016-08-18,['hiking'],"We just  hiked this trail after traversing from Twin Lakes trail.   It was fantastic, particularly to traversal from the two lakes.   Right after Lake Mary,  buy the log cabin, we came upon two Moose that were amazing to watch.   We were surprised to find that Lake Mary is drained.   Still, if did not take away from how excellent the entire hike (started at Silver Lake) was.   going the extra .1 miles to Dog Lake was also worth it,  more because of the view of Mt. Clayton from that base spot."
196,2016-08-17,[''],Lovely hike!  The reservoir is currently drained but the hike is still fun. I would say this is an easy hike
197,2016-08-16,[''],"We hiked up to Lake Katherine and saw three moose! It was a great hike with a lot of wildlife, not to strenuous and beautiful the whole way."
198,2016-08-08,[''],Just a heads up - I hiked to Lake Mary today and it has been drained. I asked a ranger at Silver Lake and she said it was drained to check on repairs they made last year.
199,2016-08-01,['hiking'],I loved his hike! I am an average hiker not super experienced and it was a little difficult because it's mostly incline all the way up but it was definitely worth it for the lake view at the top. It's also shaded most of the trail so that's very nice!
200,2016-08-01,['hiking'],"Steep and exposed at the outset of hike. Lake Mary doesn't compare to the next two lakes, Martha and Catherine. Saw six moose at these lakes. Gorgeous wildflowers and meadows. Lots of parking."
201,2016-07-31,['hiking'],"Very short hike, little crowded but well worth it if you keep going up to sunset peak!"
202,2016-07-31,['hiking'],Awesome!  Wild flowers great at end of July.  Started at 8:30 on a Sunday morning got quite busy around 10:30.
203,2016-07-26,['hiking'],Lake Mary is one of my favorite hikes! I recommend going early to beat the crowds and the heat. I started this hike at 8:00 AM and the weather was perfect the whole time.
204,2016-07-25,['hiking'],I'm kinda out of shape so it was kinda hard on the way up. But it was worth it at the end.
205,2016-07-20,['hiking'],Hiked up with 6 kids today. Started around 9:30 so it wasn't too busy...but that quickly changed the longer we were there playing. The water is really low. I was there in June and most of the rocks were under water and now they are mostly exposed. The river coming down the hike was flowing and loud and fun for the kids. Flowers are really in bloom and plentiful...as are the bugs. The chipmunks (if that is what they are) have no fear and are actually rather bothersome. You couldn't sit and eat a snack because they (and I mean a lot of them) would come right up wanting food...guess they have been fed one too many times. The bigger kids thought it was funny...the 16 month old did not. Such a great hike...with an awesome reward for the steep hills. Our kids did pretty good...only the littlest ones with the shortest legs complained.
206,2016-07-14,['hiking'],Beautiful trail! Went on a weekday and it was pretty crowded. Some areas were difficult to bypass with groups coming from both directions. Will definitely go again.
207,2016-07-13,[''],Beautiful view!! Make sure to wear bug spray! Big mosquitos.
208,2016-07-11,[''],"Amazing view from 10,150ft!"
209,2016-07-11,[''],"Beautiful, but crowded."
210,2016-07-09,['hiking'],"This hike was fun! Being pretty new to hiking it was a little harder since it's uphill the whole way, but worth it at the top! Don't forget the bug spray!"
211,2016-07-08,['hiking'],We love this trail! It's easy and scenic. It's perfect for kids and inexperienced hikers. Lake Mary is really pretty.
212,2016-07-06,[''],Absolutely love this hike! Always a little cooler up there!
213,2016-07-05,[''],"Beautiful hike, but a word is warning: a great deal of it is very steep and those who are not in top shape will find it very challenging. Several members of our party, who were older, had to take it very slowly. but what a payoff!!"
214,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"Went over the 4th of July to escape the heat of the valley.  It was mid 70's and perfect weather.  We enjoyed the hike so much the we continued on to the next two lakes above. There was still a little snow to throw around in some of the side trails, but the main trail was clear.  We even enjoyed watching a moose at Lake Martha, just above Lake Mary.   My 7 year had zero issue with all three lakes.  Make sure to bring sunscreen and bug spray.  We were a buffet for the mosquitos."
215,2016-07-05,[''],Started at Brighton ski resort. I took my 6 year old son and he did great. Perfect length and an easy hike but not a lot of shade so I would pack some sunscreen. We took fishing poles and spent a few hours fishing the lake but never caught anything. Talked with a few guys that had been there for 4 hours fishing and they never got anything. I would do the hike again with my 3 and 5 year old but would leave the poles at home.
216,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Great hike for a Father's Day Sunday and pretty views. It was a good steep climb at first for a while then evens out. We also went over to Lake Martha which was not far at all. We were not able to continue to Lake Catherine due to the snow, but we will be going back later this fall!!"
217,2016-07-01,['hiking'],This hike is beautiful. it is nice and cool in the morning. it was a little busy today on Friday. it is worth it for the views.
218,2016-07-01,['hiking'],"Beautiful, simple hike with the kids.  Not a lot of shade, but it was nice and cool in the early morning."
219,2016-06-29,[''],Beautiful!
220,2016-06-29,['hiking'],This hike is a little hard to find. It is at the base of the ski resort. It is steep to start but the views are amazing!
221,2016-06-27,['hiking'],Great hike! Perfect for the kids!
222,2016-06-27,['hiking'],"Really beautiful area, some patches of snow left!"
223,2016-06-26,['hiking'],Such a beautiful hike.  Perfect distance for our young kids and they had a blast playing at Lake Mary.
224,2016-06-26,[''],I love this hike. A lot of uphill but awesome views. Take lots of water and a lunch is great to have when you get to the lake.
225,2016-06-25,[''],"It was nice, I took my 4 kids and it was probably the perfect length of time. Kids ages are 2,4,6, and 8."
226,2016-06-25,['backpacking'],"Easy, short hike. Awesome camp spot on south side overlooking the lake."
227,2016-06-22,['hiking'],When we went up there was still some snow on the mountain side we had to hike up. Beautiful trail.
228,2016-06-20,['hiking'],"A couple years ago we went and all 5 kids made it the last lake Catherine but our favorite was Lake Mary.  Gorgeous blue water, great views along the way."
229,2016-06-07,['hiking'],"Fun, easy hike.  Definitely still covered in snow, it is easy to lose the trail if you aren't sure where it is."
230,2016-05-30,['hiking'],Very fun hike.  Still covered in snow from beginning to end.
231,2016-04-18,['walking'],Easy hike to a beautiful place.
232,2016-04-13,[''],Short but beautiful. Definitely worth it to keep going and check out the other two lakes and even Sunset Peak.
233,2015-11-03,['hiking'],"I love all the trails in this area and this one is no exception. Although the lake is just about all the way drained right now it's still a beautiful hike. It's short, though just a bit steep. Still very doable. Definitely worth it. And if you want to make it a longer hike you can continue to lakes Martha, Catherine, Catherine Pass, Pioneer Peak and Sunset Peak. Lots of options."
234,2015-10-24,[''],"Th trial is easy to hike, dog lake and twin lakes are also adjacent to the lake you could easily check them out to .."
235,2015-10-13,['hiking'],The lake is currently drained and it diminishes the beauty of the destination but is still a great short hike.
236,2015-10-10,[''],Lake Mary under construction: 1/8th full. Simple little hike. Pretty despite low water.  Trail gets better once past Lake Mary!
237,2015-09-21,[''],Great short day hike.  Can be busy on weekends.
238,2015-09-20,['hiking'],"Very, very lovely."
239,2015-09-04,[''],Awesome
240,2015-09-03,['hiking'],"Fun short hike, pretty views, Lake Mary has been drained and they're repairing the dam so there's only a little water at the old Lake Phoebe end. Still a good after work hike."
241,2015-08-30,[''],It was amazing trial! Good for hiking and fishing
242,2015-08-25,['hiking'],"Fairly easy; just a lengthy hike if you go to all three lakes. Lake Mary is definitely the most picturesque. Took my boyfriend and I about 3 ½ hours to do all three. We did stop quite a bit, but also ran back down the mountain. Tried to get up to the view where you can see the 3 lakes. It was a steep slope so we got about half way. Also saw a mama moose and her baby as we were leaving."
243,2015-08-18,[''],Very fun for the family. A lot to see. The lake is a great stop for lunch. I've never seen so many chipmunks in my life. The lake is swarming with them around the rocks. Nevertheless the views are outstanding!!
244,2015-08-10,['hiking'],"Very nice, quick hike from Brighton Ski Resort. There's two options - an out-and-back, or a loop. We opted for the out-and-back, hiking to Dog, Mary, Martha and Katherine lakes. Lake Mary was beautiful with clean reflections and fantastic lighting at sunrise. Good hike for any level of hiker."
245,2015-08-08,['hiking'],Great easy hike to take the kids on with spectacular scenery.
246,2015-08-04,[''],Absolutely loved hiking up here! Easy trail with beautiful lakes all around! Highly recommend doing this one!
247,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike done with my husband and 6 year old. Steep in spots, hike is majority uphill but great morning work out."
248,2015-08-02,['hiking'],Love this hike.      Nice hike to escape the city. The lake is quite low.
249,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"This is a nice, kid-friendly trail that offered just enough challenge for my 4 and 7-year olds.  It is a little steep in parts, but not too bad.  The lake is beautiful and a nice resting spot before hiking back down.  The only drawback was how crowded the trail was."
250,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"Fairly easy hike, with a mix of steep and flat ground. Would definitely recommend. The lake is gorgeous. We went at about 6:30 in the evening and it was a great way to watch the sunset."
251,2015-07-31,[''],Nice hike and the lake is wonderful!! Full of wildlife and greenery!
252,2015-07-28,['hiking'],Beautful hike. Busy. Gorgeus lakes.
253,2015-07-27,['hiking'],"This one is a little too busy to be my favorite, but it's easy, and the lake it beautiful, as are the wildflowers."
254,2015-07-27,['hiking'],"Great hike with beautiful wildflowers, a waterfall and Lake Mary is gorgeous.  Worth it to go a little farther to Lake Catherine."
255,2015-07-25,[''],Gorgeous!  The clouds were amazing and  the lake was crystal clear.
256,2015-07-24,[''],"Much steeper than I was expecting and an almost constant incline, so don't expect to sprint up there if you're out of shape like me. But a beautiful lake with lots of space to sit and enjoy it."
257,2015-07-16,['hiking'],Always a beautiful hike.  Wildflowers are coming out about now.  Saw 2 moose not far off the trail.  don;t miss the side trail to Dog Lake.  Downside was that on Saturday mornings in the summer there are a ton of people hiking this trail.  We had almost non-stop hikers coming from the opposite direction.  One group consisted of over 20 hikers bunched together.  Recommend a weekday for this one.
258,2015-07-16,[''],"Beautiful! My 6year old loved to play in the water a little, even though it was freezing cold. Steep but totally doable!"
259,2015-07-07,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. Go all the way up to Lake Catherine and the basin!
260,2015-07-06,[''],"Amazing view, great family time!"
261,2015-07-04,[''],Great family trail. Would do it again.
262,2015-07-03,[''],Amazing views
263,2015-06-29,[''],"One of my favorite hikes and ways to escape the heat!
This is a great hike because you can end here with gorgeous views or keep going up to Martha and Catherine. If you have even more time and energy head up to Catherine's Pass for gorgeous views of both Big and Little Cottonwood!

Bring your bug spray!!!"
264,2015-06-28,['hiking'],This is a beautiful hike and the views of Lake Mary are difficult to beat with such amazing beauty. Try to go during weekdays to avoid large crowds. Also go earlier in morning or late in afternoon bc this trail gets super hot during summer months. If you decide to go onto Martha and Catherine make sure you have mosquito repellant as we're experiencing more mosquitos this year than in the past. By the time you get to Catherine you'll experience swarms of mosquitos and horse flies.
265,2015-06-25,[''],"Love this hike!  Go higher and visit her sisters Martha, and Catherine!!!  Beautiful hike, we do it every year!"
266,2015-06-24,['hiking'],"Great hike, the lake was beautiful!"
267,2015-06-22,[''],"Great trail, kid friendly, steady uphill climb - so good exercise but not that difficult! We went on Saturday, June 20th (fathers Day Weekend) so it was super crowded but still fun to hike! Definitely recommend sunscreen (about 3/4 of the trail is full sun) and bring snacks because there are great places at the top to sit and picnic and enjoy the view!"
268,2015-06-17,['hiking'],"Completed this hike on June 11th, 2015 with my boyfriend. It was raining and cloudy, so it was a bit chilly. Short and easy hike. I have asthma, and the initial climb (first 15 minutes) was the most difficult for me. It became very easy though, and the air up there was beautiful, as were all the other views. The rain really made the hike. The end of the hike leading up to the lake isn't a trail, it's rocky, which is the only thing to watch out for. Other than that, it's a fun hike, with nice views at the end."
269,2015-06-15,['hiking'],"This was a good hike for the whole family.  Pretty busy trail, so go early to avoid the majority of people."
270,2015-06-10,['hiking'],"How to Get There:
Go up Big Cottonwood Canyon, till the very end of the canyon where it goes in a large loop. You will pass the Silver Lake Visitor Center and in the very back of the loop is the Brighton Center Building for the Brighton Ski Resort. The trailhead is just to the right of this building. You will see a large sign, with all the ski trails listed. A little behind this large sign, is a slightly smaller one which shows the map for the Lake Mary Hike. 

This was such a beautiful hike! Be prepared, as with all Higher altitude hikes, for it to be 10-15 cooler than it is in the valley. We went on June 8, it was 75 in the valley but once we got up there was around 55-60 degrees and the wind made it pretty chilly. It made for a cooler hike, there was even still snow in a few areas we had to hike over. With the ground all wet, it was a little harder to distinguish the trail, but just keep to the areas that look well worn, or muddy snow prints and you'll be okay. 

We went on a Monday around Noon, and still ran into about 10 different groups of people. I would definitely suggest going on a weekday. It was absolutely breathtaking once we made it to the lake. My 4 and 7 year old did great, we brought jackets and also snacks for when we reached the top. The clear lake, and secluded feel made this whole hike worth it. Definitely doing this one again."
271,2015-05-26,[''],Amazing landscape
272,2014-10-05,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike! Ensure you do it early in the summer, we did it twice this summer once in early June the other September. The water level had decreased a significant amount in September. Completed with two families with a total of 7 kids ranging 2-11 all did great. This is a great family hike, it starts steep but levels out and gets much better after the initial hill."
273,2014-09-15,['hiking'],"Beautiful, scenic hike - although next time I will go earlier in the summer as the lake is quite low in mid-September. This hike will be spectacular in a week or so when the colors really start to peak. It is a steady, uphill climb, but not so steep you won't feel like you'll lose your footing on the way down. Went with a friend on a Friday at 1:00pm, and it was busy, so I imagine on the weekend it's even more crowded. It is full sun about 3/4 of the time when you go mid-day so make sure you bring sunscreen and water."
274,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"I absolutely love Lake Mary. She is the most beautiful lakes out of the three sisters. I hiked up here a couple of times with my sister and then with my children and spouse. Was bummed the last time I hiked up there, the lake lost 4 feet of water. Other than that though, it is an easy and beautiful hike!"
275,2014-09-07,['hiking'],i loved this trail. Most beautiful hike ive ever done! gonna attempt Lake Catherine tomorrow! LOVE UTAH
276,2014-09-01,['hiking'],"Busy trail, but very beautiful. Lake Mary is very pretty."
277,2014-08-31,[''],Nice hike with kids - a little more challenging but diverse and interesting. We slipped over to Dog Lake on the way back. Lake Mary was beautiful. This was a very busy trail.
278,2014-08-10,[''],"absolutely stunning hike, but I have never been this upset and angry on any trail. This is watershed, you are not supposed to swim in the lakes.  Or bring your dogs (and I love furry family members, but they don't belong up here)."
279,2014-06-22,[''],"Beautiful lake! Pretty steep at the start for kids, but short. Needed a jacket, still snow. Loved this hike! Saw two moose."
280,2014-06-02,['hiking'],A lot of snow still. But it's always nice to get out of the city.
281,2014-05-17,['hiking'],Wonderful hike from Brighton to escape the summer heat!
282,2014-02-21,['hiking'],This is a beautiful hike that I make every year.  You can loop over to Twin lakes and back down to the lodge.
283,2013-10-06,[''],"We went in mid September and did not have a problem with bugs.  As other reviewers said, the first part of the hike is under and near the lifts, so not very scenic.  Dog Lake is a nice quiet spot to look around.  From Dog Lake, you hike a short distance to Lake Mary with beautiful views."
284,2013-08-19,['hiking'],"This was a great hike. Although it was only 1 mile to Lake Mary, it was pretty steep. The whole trail is mainly uphill so be prepared. If you continue on the trail, you will run into Lake Martha and the last Lake Catherine. My favorite is Lake Mary. You can get great pictures at this lake. There are Mosquitos on this trail so bring repellant. Dogs aren't allowed because it is a watershed. Totally worth the mosquito bites and uphill battle :) Do It! "
285,2013-08-06,['hiking'],Nice short hike that gets you to a pretty lake when you don't have a lot of time.
286,2013-07-28,['hiking'],It's one mile to lake Mary from the trailhead. I really like this hike. The lake is a wonderful place to hang out. I also went on the 24th and there were plenty of people on the trail. I continued on to Lake Katherine which was a great hike as well. Maybe next time I'll head for the pass which didn't look that much further. Lake Mary is a great family hike too.
287,2013-07-27,['hiking'],"The first bit of this trail actually takes you up the face of a ski slope. it's a pretty steady climb especially for kids and beginners. Lots of wildflowers on the way up the slope too, so don't forget your camera.  
As you get further up, the slope gives way to forest pines. Don't forget your bug spray! By the time we were 1/2 way up the trail, the mosquitoes were out in force. Lake Mary is beautiful and well worth the short climb. It was a bit crowded, but we went on the 24th of July so we expected it. 
All in all this was a really nice little hike. I would definitely do this one again.  "
288,2013-07-08,['hiking'],"Great hike!  Didn't care too much for the lower section of the trail where the ski lift is located.  There were a bunch of wild flowers.  The first mile or so to Lake Mary is a pretty steady climb.  If you continue to lake Catherine its not too bad.  Dog Lake is more of a pond, definitely wear bug spray if you go near there.  We saw two moose resting in the shade near Lake Catherine while we were continuing on to the pass.  The hike is a little over 5 miles if you go all the way to the pass and back."
289,2013-06-23,['hiking'],"High use trail, lots of weekend hikers. The trail is well maintained and there are enough signs to navigate if you don't know the area. Easy hike up to Dog Lake then just a short distance to Mary, Martha and Catherine. Good hike for kids 7+  I would pack your younger ones (under 4). "
290,2012-12-01,['hiking'],Great hike! Go to Sunset peak that's right after the last lake.
291,2012-08-16,['hiking'],"Nice lake.  

Actually did this as part of a loop, visiting other lakes as well.  Started on a trail which goes around the north side of Silver Lake just west of Brighton, looped around by Twin Lakes, then on to Lake Mary, then came back on the trail advertised here."
292,2012-08-08,['hiking'],"Beautiful place also good fishing; Lake Trout, Brook Trout, Rainbow Trout,& maybe a few Brown Trout. Fun camping overnight or two. "
293,2012-07-29,['hiking'],"Trail is well marked, starts at Brighton Lodge, and is mostly a dirt trail except for a couple of gravel and boulder sections.  Water in the lake is exceptionally clear.  Fine view of granite peaks and a mostly obscured view of the valley below. Saw a moose grazing about 20 yards from the path.

Trail is a fairly steady climb with the last half somewhat steeper than the first in order to gain all 792 feet to the lake. There are a couple of ragged parts over washed out boulders.  Took the trail with children from 4 to 11 all walking on their own.  Found the trekking poles quite useful on the rough parts and during the descent."
294,2011-10-10,['hiking'],I nice easy hike.  Pretty lake.  Great place for flower photos too.
295,2011-08-09,['hiking'],"I've done Lake Mary twice in two weeks. In 2010 the reservoir was nearly empty and old Lake Phoebe was visible as a distinct entity (after the reservoir was built, Lake Phoebe, the further lake from the reservoir, was swallowed by it's neighbor). I was expecting to see the weird, alien landscape from last year and was shocked upon cresting the hill to see a beautiful alpine lake! The best view, in my opinion, is from the far end of the lake.

I continued up past Lake Martha, Lake Catherine, and up to the saddle. Then I saw the sign saying .3 miles to Sunset Peak and went for it. Throughout my hike, I counted 30-40 varieties of wildflowers.

I'm not that crazy about the lower section of the trail which traverses the ski slopes, but Lake Mary is so pretty it's worth the mundanity. 

Oh, and as for Dog Lake, it's more of a Puppy Pond, and it is wildly infested with mosquitoes."
296,2011-08-05,['hiking'],"Very fun, quick hike, extremely beautiful. We had several snow ball fights on the way up and back down with our kids. "
