0,2019-09-04,['hiking'],"Excellent trail. We went on an overcast Tuesday at 11 AM and only saw a few other people the whole hike. It’s mostly shaded with gorgeous pine and aspen forests, but it crosses through some open areas where you get the most incredible views. First time here, and I’m only an intermediate hiker, but it’s my favorite hike in Park City so far. 

Trails are well marked. You’ll take Rob’s Trail, then a short connect on Ambush trail to Mid Mountain trail. From there you can choose to go up the Ridge Connect trail all the way to the top of the mountain, but we decided to skip that and just turn around back down the trail. 

We took an Uber to the trailhead since we don’t have a car here, and it looked like limited parking. Since we are staying near the Canyons Village area, we took Ambush trail to Holly’s trail on the way down and walked straight back to our hotel. Ended up being 8 miles. We’re sore but it was well worth it!! "
1,2019-08-10,['hiking'],"Fun Trail. Excellent condition. Great parking area at trailhead 
Saw no large animals, but plenty of evidence they are around "
2,2019-07-31,['mountain biking'],Overcast. Crickets still chirping. 4 prairie hens?
3,2019-07-26,['mountain biking'],Overcast. Monsoon. Give me sun and blue sky.
4,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Great trail and absolutely beautiful especially on blue bird days. A good mix of shady and sunny areas. Beware the hike is 9.4 miles with 1700 feet elevation gain.
5,2019-07-11,['hiking'],"Great trail, Robs trail ends at the two mile mark, so it’s 4 miles round trip if you stop there, we hiked on up another two miles, great views"
6,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"Trail was great today, lots of birds on the lower 0.7 miles. Fun hike with the pup and little one."
7,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"Hiked with my son, a marathon runner.  Misread the signs and didn’t quite make the end of the trail but still a great outing.  Didn’t see any wildlife but hiked midday so not unexpected. Mountain bikers were all friendly, not very numerous, and all announced how many or last biker. Description should say Robs Trail to Ambush to Mid-mountain. It was mostly shady with a few sunny areas crossing ski runs. It was a great outing!"
8,2019-06-11,['hiking'],Nice trail. Great views. Still a fair amount of snow towards the top that you have to cross.  Was difficult with a 4 year old in parts.  Lots of bikers.
9,2019-06-08,['snow'],"Amazing trail! My favorite so far! Insane views once you're at the top! 
The trail was very gradual and easy up until the last quarter mile. Then it was all snow and took us at least 30 minutes! Only made it because I had good boots and picked up walking sticks! Will be a piece of cake once the rest of the snow melts.
On the way down through, you could take a ski run and slide on your butt for 500 feet which is worth it alone! 
Took a couple alternatives routes but ended up at 9 miles and 4 hours 15 minutes"
10,2019-06-03,[''],"June 2, 2019  We loved this trail!! Branched off at the top where the Sam L. memorial is. We followed the mountain peak trail back down to Olympic Park. The views were breathtaking from the top.  Patches of snow still on the ground but we were able to go around. Evidence of moose but no sightings. 8.5 miles one way to Olympic Park.  Would have loved to hike it back but our youngest was struggling. "
11,2019-03-09,['hiking'],Snow shoed trail today . Beautiful views.Beautiful trail. Saw moose
12,2019-03-07,[''],we snowshoed it. It was awesome.
13,2019-01-20,[''],"We snowshoed about 1/2 (4.2 miles) of this trail. Starting at 1.7 miles in, no trail had been forged through the snow yet. The woods were beautiful. Most longer-distance views were of skiers. It was fun for a snowshoe workout but it wouldn’t be my first choice for hiking or great views."
14,2018-10-28,['hiking'],"Correction about my last review:  
We parked at the Community Church on Bear Hollow.  Started on the Collins Trail heading up to Rob's Trail.  After the moose we came down that trail but took a side trail into the neighborhood that connected us to Dubois Trail (not Dejong) ."
15,2018-10-20,['hiking'],A bit of ice and mud at the bottom but it gets better at the top.  We were probably a couple of weeks late for the aspens—they must be fabulous with gold leaves.  Was still beautiful with all the white trunks and leaves in the trail. Nice view of the Canyons from the top.
16,2018-10-07,['hiking'],"Great easy trail that’s fun with your dog (on a leash)... beautiful trees and views, and nice and wide. Careful of mountain bikers, and avoid busy times as it can get crowded."
17,2018-09-16,['hiking'],Great hike. We had to go up the “gulley” since a marvelous full grown bull moose decided to block the trail. There was no way to convince the big guy to move.
18,2018-07-30,[''],"Great hike with plenty of shade and sun. I got a bit confused when trail signs denoting Rob's trail seemed to stop. I keep turning right to go higher. Trail markers said Mid-mountain, GPS here said I was still on track. Great view at the top! Mountain bikers were polite & friendly.
At the end of this trail are a few other options to go further. I opted for the extra bit at the top to reach Murdock's peak-the first part is quite steep & rocky and then eases up. Going down is always a bit more interesting!"
19,2018-07-28,[''],"Loved this winding, scenic trail."
20,2018-07-25,[''],"Smooth trail, not too rocky, uphill but not too steep. Beautiful views and plenty of shade!"
21,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"I really enjoyed everything about this hike! It was long, with a steady incline throughout. No parts of the trail were really any more challenging than others. The trail itself was relatively soft dirt, with a few rocks jutting out. There were plenty of mountain bikers, all of which were extremely respectful and informative of how many were behind them. The trail is shaded the majority of the time. There are switchbacks towards the upper half that I really enjoyed, because the trail would weave through the thick trees and bushes, then open up to a beautiful meadow and view of the valley below. We began our hike around 11:30a Saturday and finished around 3p. Highly recommend this hike!"
22,2018-07-14,['hiking'],"This was such a beautiful hike. We were on the trail at 7 on Saturday morning and had the trail to ourselves until the way back down - lots of mountain bikers. The foliage was full, the aspens were stunning, and the wildflowers were a dream. We went all the way up to Murdoch Peak. It was a perfect moderate hike on a well travelled trail, with steady inclines and shade about 60% of the time."
23,2018-07-08,['hiking'],A lot of mtn bikers
24,2018-07-07,['hiking'],I haven’t hiked this for a month or so  but I usually hike up to the bench and back so don’t get the same mileage as stated even though it is still a nice moderate hike. This is a trail for almost anytime of year except right when it is becoming slush in spring. Mostly shaded with lots of trees so beautiful in fall also. I have never seen moose on this trail but have many friends that say they have seen them on this hike. This would be a good hike for visitors to Park City adjusting to altitude as it does not involve steep climbing.
25,2018-06-17,[''],The wildflowers on this trail are amazing! Just gorgeous.
26,2018-05-05,['hiking'],First hike in Park City and it was beautiful! Took Rob's trail to Ambush then headed left onto Rosebud. Highly recommend this route!
27,2018-01-27,[''],Beautiful hike up and fun sledding down!
28,2017-12-17,['hiking'],Such a beautiful hike! Saw at least 7 moose while on the trail.
29,2017-12-14,['hiking'],"Beautiful snowy hike with everything you could want on a hike: pine forest, aspen groves, wide vistas and benches placed perfectly along the way to stop and rest and take in the view."
30,2017-12-12,['hiking'],Wonderful easy hike especially when coming up from sea level.
31,2017-11-26,['hiking'],Hiked last week with a nice layer of snow. Winter wonderland with nice views of canyons at top.
32,2017-11-25,[''],Awesome
33,2017-11-18,['hiking'],"Super hike today on lots of fresh snow. Saw two moose on the way up to the top of Rob’s trail. First time using the All Trails app and we loved having the data and using the downloaded map. Yep we went “pro” at breakfast and so glad we did. 

It was a slower hike up due to the 8” or so of snow but a very quick descent."
34,2017-11-16,[''],Excellent....we saw 7 moose on our hike today.
35,2017-10-01,['hiking'],I don't know where you get your mileage but hiked it today and it was 2.8 miles one way. Trail does end at the intersection of a couple of other trails so you can extend your hike if you want to. Pretty easy trail with a few scenic areas. Would be a good family hike if kids could handle this distance. You could do the hike in tennis shoes.
36,2017-08-20,['hiking'],"This was our first family hike since moving to PC last week. I thought the trail was great. Several scenic spots, in good condition, not too crowded."
37,2017-08-09,[''],great trail. lots of fun
38,2017-07-10,[''],Been on it like 100 times. It is such a good trail to get some fresh air. And if you want to get your bike to go on the trail to is awesome for biking also. Lots of nature and good views. You might also see a moose
39,2017-07-03,['hiking'],Took rob's trail 2.5 ish miles. Gentle uphill about 1000 feet and lots of shade early in day. Wide open vistas. Switched to ambush trail then back via Rosebud Heaven with some uphill to get back to Rib's trail. A few mountain bikers on Ambush. Off Rib's trail some nice views of the ski slopes and then of the Canyons resort.
40,2017-06-18,[''],"Tough climb, good views."
41,2017-06-18,['hiking'],Loved the wildflowers and butterflies!  Well marked and maintained.
42,2017-01-31,['hiking'],"My immediate memory of being on this trail was enchanting. The mix of trees, sunshine to shade, and little colorful splashes of life on the trail (including butterflies and flowers) really made for a good slow enjoyable hike. I was, with no shame, the last one in my group to reach the cars in the end. But I did in fact get so left behind, from looking at all of the wonder of this trail, that I was just a tiny bit confused on how to get back down with the few splits in the trail. I made it down safe but I did have to back track twice even though I did have a map and help from a biker and his, much bigger than mine, map."
43,2017-01-22,[''],Great for snowshoeing. Gets into the woods quickly. Switchbacks afford an easy climb and nice views.
44,2017-01-08,[''],Lots of snow! Once you get to the memorial bench go right for amazing views of snowboarders and skiers
45,2016-12-03,[''],very nice. a guy with a dog frightened a moose we were looking at but otherwise very enjoyable snow hike
46,2016-11-05,['trail running'],Perfect for trail runs! It goes on for quite a ways and leads to other trails. Also not difficult so it was enjoyable.
47,2016-08-24,[''],This has some great views.
48,2016-07-27,[''],Nice trail. I was disappointed when I came to the saddle and started the descent. It connects with mid mountain trail for an added experience
49,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"Not bad, next time hiking boots or trail shoes. Way too much dirt got into my running shoe."
50,2016-07-18,[''],"Nice easy walk/hike. Not steep, well groomed. Good to get the dog out. Not too excited though."
51,2016-06-04,[''],"Popular, beautiful and shaded, Rob's is a good year-round trail that makes for a great hike, snowshoe or trail run. Rob's, is also a good access trail for the Mid-Mountain and Wasatch Crest Trails."
52,2016-06-01,['hiking'],"A nice trail with lots of switchbacks to easy the uphill climb.  A few views of Park City on the way up, and views of ski slopes towards the top. Lots of spring flowers.  I gave it 3 stars because it lacks variety, no waterfalls or ponds, etc."
53,2016-03-25,['trail running'],Heavily used so the snow is perfectly packed down for a winter trail run. Favorite after work trail run!
54,2015-07-13,[''],"Great trail with my two young boys ...nice afternoon, different terrain, forests, shade, sun and lookouts :)"
55,2015-06-30,[''],Great. A few bikers but beautiful!
56,2014-08-13,['hiking'],We were in Park City with friends who all had young children. We ended up hiking this trail with all our kids and it was great. Elevation gain of around 820 ft up about 1.8 miles. Ages of kids ranged from 4-8 years old and all did well. Fun family hike that isn't difficult.
