0,2019-09-04,['hiking'],Nice hike. Enjoyed the falls and the trail is pretty well maintained. The water flow was high this time of year (early September) so much so that it flowed over a portion of the only footbridge on the trail to the falls.
1,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'closed']","The trail has been opened as far as the waterfall, but further up the canyon, above the falls, is still closed."
2,2019-08-29,"['hiking', 'closed']","The trail was supposed to reopen August 16, but apparently has not been opened yet. They are repairing a culinary water line."
3,2019-08-29,[''],"moderate incline, fairly wide trails.
hiking is closed to the falls, but not to the G which is a moderate to difficult hike with beautiful views of the valley!"

5,2019-08-08,['hiking'],I posted a one star because as of 1:40 pm. August 8th-the trail is CLOSED due to high water run off. 
6,2019-08-05,['hiking'],this is a nice trial to work yourself. I am getting back into shape and this was just what I needed
7,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"I will have to try this trail another time. It’s closed until at least 8/16/19 due to high water levels. $5,000 fine if caught hiking it anyway. "
8,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
9,2019-08-02,['hiking'],trail is currently closed due to high water run off. 
10,2019-08-01,['hiking'],This trail was closed on July 31 when I went to hike it due to debris and high water
11,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"Beautidul hike. If you can past the raging water the hike continues. We jumped over going up a d just walked
I to the water coming down. Its a steep hike bit provides lots of shade!"
12,2019-07-28,['hiking'],It is a fun quick hike for people in the area. We had water shoes on for crossing a creek and continuing the hike past the falls. Part of the trail is washed out but it made for a fun adventure. 
13,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Good trail but be ready for a decent river crossing

15,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'bugs']","always a great hike. we did it with three kids and they did great. 10,8,5"
16,2019-07-20,['hiking'],lots and lots of water right now looks really nice
17,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'muddy']",
18,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"Steep trail...waterfall is very pretty. Fun to watch people rappelling down the cliff next to the waterfall. If you hike past, there are a few small waterfalls and stream crossings. Very fun trail and would definitely do again. Towards the top, very pretty view of Utah Lake."
19,2019-07-12,['hiking'],Awesome day rappelling with the Johnson's.
20,2019-07-10,['hiking'],We went on Monday at about 4pm and had the trail and waterfall all to ourselves!!!
21,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Trail was steep and dusty but great to hike to the lower falls for my girls (10, 8, and 4 years old)."
22,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"This was an overall good hike. Very pretty falls; great views. It's about 30-40% shaded (depending on the time of day). Fairly steep in some places but manageable. If you are not into crowds, do not come on a Saturday. There is more to see past the main falls, and gets less crowded beyond. "
23,2019-07-05,['hiking'],Fun hike. All up hill until you start going back down. I only went to the base of the falls but I'd love to come back and do the full hike. Very pretty waterfall. The trail had a few families on it but I wouldn't call it crowded. There was someone repelling down the waterfall so I imagine people come to watch their friends do that. Not sure what the sweet spot is for when to hike this trail. We went around 11am on a weekday in the summer. Make sure it's not a terribly hot day. The parking lot will give you a good idea of whether the trail is busy or not. Wonderful views. I hope to come back.
24,2019-07-05,['hiking'],Good hike 
25,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"I went a bit past the falls, but not all the way since I came to a stream and didn't have my hiking poles to cross it. I loved the path to there and will need to come back to do it again."
26,2019-07-05,['hiking'],This was a fun hike! It’s pretty steep but super easy! Anyone can participate! Even your four legged friend! 
27,2019-07-04,['hiking'],If you like standing in line and hiking with groups of people this hike is for you. We even tried to go early and there were still groups of 15+ people all over the trail. It was chaos and annoying. Would be pretty if there wasn’t so many people or such large groups. I probably wouldn’t go back unless I had a random week day off work to do so. Also if you don’t have a high clearance vehicle good luck getting to the top of the parking lot. 
28,2019-07-01,['hiking'],"Half shade, half sun. This hike gets steeper the farther you go. But it’s short, so it was completely doable for everyone in our group. We had kids ranging in age from 2 to adult, and none of us struggled. The waterfall at the end was beautiful and refreshing."
29,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Great family hike. Like the comments say...perfect for young children. The waterfall is beautiful right now. Trail is rocky and dry. 
30,2019-06-26,"['hiking', 'rocky']",This is a good family hike. Lots of families and lots of dogs on the trail. If you just want to hike to the base of the waterfall and back it's 1.2 miles round trip. 
31,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Did this trail with my 6 year old and my dad. Seems like most people don’t go past the waterfall which is only about 30 minutes up, but we did the whole trail. If I were to do this trail again I wouldn’t go past the waterfall. Definitely a good workout but the reward at the top wasn’t worth it in my eyes. Not a fantastic view just okay. But for a one time thing it was fun! Waterfall was great, lots of water right now. There are a couple more smaller waterfalls when you go past that first one. A few creek crossings. Fun trail but just not a great reward at the end. "
32,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
33,2019-06-20,['hiking'],"nice wide trail, could hold hands most of the time. today had lots of cottonwood flurries for those with allergies. will do again for sure."
34,2019-06-20,['hiking'],"Love this trail, perfect for my 3 kids!  There are 3 little moon pools at the top of the falls that are perfect for sitting or wading in if you can take the ice cold water this time of year"
35,2019-06-20,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'over grown']","Beautiful 4 mile hike, lots of water runoff on a good portion of the trail after the falls, made it muddy"
36,2019-06-19,['hiking'],Hiking by the stream was beautiful. Getting to the waterfall was the easy part. However if you continue on the trail it’s only up until you turn around to go back to the train head!
37,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Great trail. No snow up to the flats where we camped on June 18.
38,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'bugs']","mosquitos are out
This was a really fun trail with 9,7, & 2yr olds. I would say this was very easy, my 2yr old had no problems walking the whole time. it was colder than I expected at the falls, so next time I'll pack a light jacket. I would recommend this for 1st timers for sure."
39,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'scramble']",The trail gets steep close to the waterfalls but is so worth it! Our dog was off leash the whole time and she had a ball.  The views from the first waterfall is worth it 100%. Good hike. 
40,2019-06-14,['snow'],great hike up past the main waterfall. go up far enough and there's still some snow!
41,2019-06-14,[''],great little hike.
42,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky']",
43,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'rocky']",A steep hike but pretty. And that’s just to the first falls
44,2019-06-09,[''],easy hike
45,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'rocky']",First part of the trail is highly trafficked until you reach the waterfall where most people seem to turn around. There was a part of the trail that was completely covered by the river so it was a little tricky to go through. All in all a fun hike.
46,2019-06-08,[''],nice and short
47,2019-06-07,['hiking'],Pretty easy up to the main waterfall but quite steep if you plan on going to the top where the grove is. 
48,2019-06-06,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'washed out']",
49,2019-06-03,[''],fun easy hike up to a waterfall. kids love it. so does our dog. 
50,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
51,2019-05-26,['hiking'],"great for dogs, awesome waterfall!"
52,2019-05-26,['hiking'],Kind of a steep hike but a short one to the falls. We started at about 1015 AM and it was already busy. Lots of little kids and dogs. Most dogs were on leash and the few that weren't the owners restrained as we walked past with our on leash dogs. The hike was well shaded and had access to the water for the pups. 
53,2019-05-26,['hiking'],Great dog friendly trail with lots of water following the creek.  The waterfall is very early and the trail ends after a long climb at an open field.
54,2019-05-25,['hiking'],"The map is a little deceiving. The waterfall is only about .6 up the trail. You can continue above the waterfall. Moderate hike, but worth it for the waterfall. It’s just long and hard enough for the kids to enjoy! "
55,2019-05-22,['hiking'],It’s a great hike for a summer afternoon! 
56,2019-05-21,[''],Found a Legit Camping Hammock a couple weeks ago on this trail. 8016438649
57,2019-05-12,[''],Busy trail but a nice short hike to the waterfall. Great hike to get you started for the season. Rapelling anchors are available at the waterfall which is pretty cool. 
58,2019-05-11,['hiking'],"Easy hike. 2 miles out and back to the falls. Family friendly and dog friendly, which makes for a crowded hike any time after 10am Saturday or Sunday with kids running all over the place."
59,2019-05-11,['hiking'],"Nice  trail, not very busy at 8am."
60,2019-05-09,['hiking'],Mostly dry last week after some stormless days. Any muddy spots you can easily walk around. I cut off early up to the overlook and looped back around to Kiwanis. Maybe 5 hours going slow.
61,2019-05-05,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Pretty hike this afternoon. Crowded on a Sunday around 12:30-1pm. Moderately steep incline the whole way up.
62,2019-05-05,['hiking'],"Nice short hike. Right under 2 miles from where you park your car, to the waterfall and back. Nice little pond half way up.. great trail for families, kids, and dogs..  great waterfall.."
63,2019-05-05,['hiking'],"Nice hike, no snow, not muddy. There are a few points where you cross the creek on fallen logs, there’s not a big drop or anything but it may be tough for those with bad balance. There are a few steep sections too. Overall a great hike to start your summer."
64,2019-04-29,['hiking'],"I would recommend this trail to more experienced hikers, NOT beginners. It is very steep in some parts and where it is not very steep it is still steep. Beautiful creek, waterfall and view."
65,2019-04-23,['hiking'],"It’s steep but short, the waterfall is a lot of fun. We do rapelling up there quite often. It’s a nice little 70 foot rap with a tree anchor that you can either go down in the water or off to the side. Easy hiking trail goes up to the top of the waterfall"
66,2019-04-22,[''],Steep hike up. No mud. Most of the snow has melted. Good hike with kids.
67,2019-04-21,['mountain biking'],"My first trail of the season, would not recommend for that purpose! It is a fun trail, mountain bikers just be aware that it is a steep climb up, but a fun ride down. Unless you want to end up with Hike-a-bike, get some conditioning in first. Some narrower sections with lose rock that makes it hard for beginners, waterfall looks great!"
68,2019-04-20,[''],beautiful trail 
69,2019-04-15,['hiking'],Waterfall had a fair amount of water flowing and it wasn’t muddy at all!
70,2019-04-13,['hiking'],Slightly muddy. Very fun.
71,2019-03-31,['hiking'],very dog and kid friendly. great beginner trail. amazing views!
72,2019-03-17,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","March, 17, 2019
The hike to the falls is about 0.9 miles up. the remaining 1.1 miles puts you in a flat meadow with an amazing view of Utah Lake! A little above the Falls crampons are recommended. Especially coming down. The last 1/2 mile, snowshoes would be nice but not absolutely needed. Gaiters...definitely. You're gonna sink a bit. lol. Steep but great hike!"
73,2019-03-15,"['hiking', 'snow']",
74,2019-03-09,"['hiking', 'snow']",Fun hike. A good amount of snow. Snowshoes definitely help once you get above the initial climb.
75,2019-03-02,['hiking'],beautiful hike with freshly fallen snow. halfway up it got a little too deep for my dog and so we turned after the waterfalls. but it's a Quick Escape from the hustle and bustle of the valley. a bubbling Creek accompanies you nearly the whole way with several small waterfalls.
76,2019-02-19,"['hiking', 'snow']","Nice hike, pretty busy during the summer but in the winter it’s peaceful and GORGEOUS. Went as far as we could without snowshoes, once you get up high enough the path disappears because people don’t travel it. Great winter hike."
77,2019-02-12,"['hiking', 'snow']","Hiked this on 2/10, great hike, made it about 3/4s of the way up before the snow was too deep. It was slippery on the way down, so bring spikes/poles!"
78,2019-01-26,[''],Did this hike on 1/22/19. Waterfall is mostly frozen. Went back in about 2 miles in past the waterfall. Trail is packed down most of the way. Turned around when I got an avalanche warning on my phone.
79,2018-12-02,[''],"Took me 1 hr to get up in the snow, with a dog, a random rappel at the first falls and a couple of stops to grab some good ol' h2o. It only took me under 30 min to get back to my car from the""top"" --I like to trail run down. Would recommend."
80,2018-11-11,[''],Absolutely beautiful and an easy hike! The water fall is half frozen and stunning. Definitely would recommend!!
81,2018-11-10,[''],"We went right after it rained, so the fall colors were extra pretty! About halfway up we hit some heavy fog which was really cool, and made for a great fall hike! Haha, your pants will get wet from brushing along wet grass if you go after rain"
82,2018-11-05,[''],It is a sweet hike not very long but the beauty is worth it.
83,2018-10-29,['hiking'],Easy and short trail. I like it.
84,2018-10-27,[''],
85,2018-10-25,[''],"It's a good family, friendly trail."
86,2018-10-21,[''],I liked it. Lots of people up to the falls but after the falls it is somewhat steeper and less hikers. Easy trail to follow even through the tall grass in the meadows.
87,2018-10-08,[''],"This was a fun, short hike. We walked from Nunns Park up to the trailhead and then hiked to the falls. very beautiful waterfall and a close hike to get away from the city life! To get up close to the falls there is a bit of a scramble but the rest of the hike is fine. Steep, but short and doable for all."
88,2018-10-06,['hiking'],One of my new favorites!! Fun fun fun. . With great views and smells from the fresh air infused with the creek and the fall colors! Get your blood pumping .
89,2018-10-01,[''],"Nice hike, a little tricky without good shoes due to loose shale."
90,2018-09-24,[''],"Fun hike for the family, including 2 young kids and 2 small dogs."
91,2018-09-09,[''],Luv it
92,2018-09-03,['hiking'],"Fun hike, but a little misleading for first-timers. The falls—which are awesome—are within the first half-mile of the hike. On a holiday (like today—Labor Day), that section of the hike is very busy. From there, the trail along the stream is very narrow in parts, with treacherous, loose gravel drop offs. If you have little ones like us, you’ll want to keep a hand on them. 
After the first mile, which is quite steep to boot, the trail evens out and is quite lovely. We didn’t quite make it to the end, but came within spitting distance—we clocked exactly 4 miles total. Plan on around three hours if you’re going to go the distance."
93,2018-09-03,['hiking'],This is my favorite hike in Utah county! It would be nice if the trailhead was marked so you know you're on the right path...I was confused for a bit before I figured out which trail to take.
94,2018-09-03,['hiking'],"What a great trail!! My pup and I went early on in the morning (around 7:45am) on a Sunday and only saw 3 other people. It was cool weather which was nice. The hike was great. A little steeper than I thought, but managed to do it just fine (gave my thighs a little burn) and my dog did it easily. The first waterfall is the tallest one (and where most people stopped and turned around). If you keep going there are a few smaller waterfalls and just amazing scenery in general. I followed the All Trails outline of the trail and it lead to a beautiful open meadow area. The trail goes on, but we decided to go back to the truck and it turned out to be a total of 4.5 miles round trip. I am happy I went earlier as when I was heading down, towards the waterfalls were the families and such. I prefer to just hike with the pup and myself so we try to do all of our hikes early on, plus the weather is nicer. Like I said earlier, it is a little steep and it's a lot of loose rocks (be careful if you aren't sure footed or have kids as it is a little narrow). I can't wait to do this hike again."
95,2018-08-20,['hiking'],"Did this a few weeks ago with my three kids(10,7,3). It was an easy hike to the lower(big) Falls. We played in the water and stood under the waterfall. Be careful and make sure no one is up on top of the waterfall causing rocks to fall."
96,2018-08-18,[''],"Great hike to the falls. If you want to go further, it's nice, too. Fairly steep after the falls, but not hard."
97,2018-08-13,[''],Very nice hike. The views are incredible. And to have the stream right along the trail was awesome! Will definitely do this hike again
98,2018-08-12,[''],good short hike and very nice falls.
99,2018-08-08,[''],Short. Easy with kids. Beautiful.
100,2018-08-04,['hiking'],Great for kids an goes straight up till the waterfalls
101,2018-07-28,[''],Love it!
102,2018-07-28,['hiking'],Definitely a steady climb. I always thought there was just one water fall because I always stopped down at the base and hung out then went back down. Today I kept going up past the waterfall and discovered more falls. The trail does continue to climb. we stopped at the area where it forks off to either Curly Springs or Dry Creek. The sign said only 1.3 miles from the Kiwanis park (where the parking lot was) felt like we went further. The hike was gorgeous and past the falls there was an occasional person or people hiking but for the majority of the time we were alone.
103,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"Popular hike- the parking lot was essentially full around 9am on Saturday. Trail mostly shaded so could have even come later in the day. It's a short hike to the main waterfall, but  there are more waterfalls to be seen if you keep going on the trail."
104,2018-07-22,[''],Nice shaded hike with beautiful waterfalls
105,2018-07-22,[''],Super easy hike for the family and for your little ones. People bring their dogs on the trail and leave theirs dogs “mess” so watch for that. But fun and very popular.
106,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"The first part of the trail can accommodate groups rather nicely as it is wide excluding a few passes. It felt like a relatively safe trail for children to be lightly supervised.

If you decide to keep hiking past the initial waterfall the trail starts to increase in difficulty considerably. More water and incline conditioning is required."
107,2018-07-14,['hiking'],"A very clean and uncrowded area. People complaining about it being to hot are the ones who can't force themselves to get up before 9:00 am. It's a beautiful temperature through 6 - 7 am. Beware it gets more crowded around 9 am. The falls where beautiful and there is a small stream that comes from the falls that you see 1/4 the way there. The trail goes on past the falls, and leads to a pretty view of the city inbetween the mountains. I went at the perfect time as was able to see the sun rise over the mountains near the end of the trail."
108,2018-07-13,['hiking'],"This area is dry and hot this year.  I started out about 9am. 30min in it was hot. We passed by the first waterfall  and found the trail nice and empty. It is very busy the first .5 miles to the falls. 

One other complaint is the bathroom at Kiwanis  park at the trail head is disgusting, toilet paper smeared all over the ground with brownish liquid all over them., no toilet paper on the rolls. Stinky with allot of flies. There is a park behind the high school on road you come in on that is so much nicer."
109,2018-07-12,[''],"Easy 1/2 mile hike to the first waterfall, but going past that gets pretty difficult.  Very steep.  We made it 2 miles in and turned back.  We thought the 4 mile estimate for this trail was round trip, but later learned it is one way.  Also, many people said they took their small kids on this easily - maybe to the first Falls.  Past that, I cannot see a child that size getting terribly far (I have 2 small children myself).  Overall though, we enjoyed it...challenging & great scenery!"
110,2018-07-12,['hiking'],"This hike is great. The trail is indeed, busy and heavily trafficked. Unfortunately, there is trash and dog poo. But... once the trail begins to run alongside the creek, it’s beautiful. Then, the falls. It’s a fun and safe hike to the falls.
If you hike past the falls, elevation climbs drastically. For those of us who are not from Utah... the elevation really affects the lungs. But it’s beautiful. Take lots of water, and prepare for an uphill climb in... and a steep downhill out.
Also: the trail goes much farther than the 4-miles in, as it merges with a couple other trails, including Dry Canyon. There appear to be rustic camp sites along the trail..."
111,2018-07-10,['hiking'],"great fun, kids had a blast. we brought them in their swim suits and shorts on top so they could play in some of the little pond formations. overall, we had a great time."
112,2018-07-08,['hiking'],Fun and easy it does get steep. the waterfall is beautiful.
113,2018-07-07,[''],It is a short hike.  I went with my 4 yr old and he did great.   Pretty falls and scenery.
114,2018-07-06,['hiking'],A nice easy hike with a nice cool waterfall to sit by. Definitely would recommend to people starting to hike.
115,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"Great hike, Dogs ok, I took my 10,11,15, and 4 year old and they did just fine, keep in mind if you are out of shape to take your time to not rush and you can make it. Very woorth the Falls ar the end defiantly go!!!!"
116,2018-07-04,[''],"As others have said hike to falls is about a mile slight incline, my 5 & 8 year old girls did well to this point and even to the top of the falls.  Falls are not that impressive but there is a nice spot to look up from the bottom and enjoy the cool mist.  The trail continues uphill along the river with a few smaller waterfalls.  They tired pretty quickly after the falls and we turned around about a mile past the falls."
117,2018-06-28,[''],"Stopped a little after the waterfall, but it's a nice and wide trail to that point. Plenty of space at the bottom of the waterfall to hang out. Also, the incline is not too bad as it's spread out pretty evenly."
118,2018-06-22,[''],"We just hiked to the main falls, about a mile trip. Kids loved it."
119,2018-06-20,['hiking'],"A great trail! Mostly uphill and kind of steep but all my kids did it (ages 4-11). It follows a creek and is mostly shady. We left about 9:30am and it wasn’t too hot or cold yet. The water is very cold, but refreshing. Beautiful views. Kind of rocky and loose gravel on the steepest hills so wear good shoes."
120,2018-06-20,['hiking'],The hike to the waterfall itself is probably about a mile or so and we usually turn around once we reach the waterfall. The beginning is a steady steep climb. About a few minutes in the hike there is water flowing on the side of the trail which is great for doggos to cool down. A lot of people hang out at the bottom of the waterfall and have picnic. You can also climb to the top of the water fall and kinda see Utah lake at a distance. We have not ran into a lot of dogs here but there are a lot of family hikers. The hike is offleash for dogs. Also the waterfall is pretty short but still beautiful.
121,2018-06-19,['hiking'],Very steep short hike to falls. Fun little places to walk in the river and up under the waterfall.
122,2018-06-19,['hiking'],"Elegant trail, fun water spots, assistance in any steep areas. bring water!

A perfect place for photos. Bring a camera!!"
123,2018-06-18,[''],"The hike to the waterfall doesn't have the most beautiful scenery but if you're up for it, you can keep going past the big waterfall and a second little waterfall and it becomes beautiful! we went all the way up the canyon to an open meadow that has a campfire pit. I highly recommend getting to the meadow if you can. Coming down was a little hard on the knees so take it slow if you need to."
124,2018-06-17,['hiking'],"beautiful falls! good tree cover, and the trail wasn't too steep. we only went a little past the falls, but the creek was beautiful. the birds singing made a great backdrop! great area for bird watchers."
125,2018-06-11,['hiking'],Four star rating only because  we've  been spoiled  by bigger and more beautiful  falls in the past. We hiked to the top of the first falls and beyond which made it more worthwhile. The trial  os not as scenic but when you  get to the top of the falls it is.  Not much shade but at least the parking lot is sufficient
126,2018-06-08,['hiking'],Good short hike if you just go to the main waterfall.
127,2018-06-07,['hiking'],"This is  good moderate hike. The trail is marked well. It is a steady climb with no real switchbacks. You do cross the creek a few times above the lower falls. I hiked about halfway between the two falls, and saw a couple smaller falls along the way. Good shade. The shale-like rocks are tough on  the knees."
128,2018-06-04,['hiking'],The route on the map leads to a random spot on the loop trail toward dry canyon so if you’re hoping for another bigger waterfall you’ll be let down. The river is gorgeous up there though. Good workout hike too! Nice and steep way to start the season
129,2018-06-03,['hiking'],A great hike for kids.  Enough vertical incline to get your heart rate up just a bit.  Quick in and out and not too far.  I did this twice in two days and both times it was fairly crowded.
130,2018-05-29,['hiking'],"A lot of people just stop at the falls, but you can actually go to the top of the falls and keep following the trail. I haven’t hiked the whole thing yet (the trail leads to dry creek), but it is an amazing hike! I love meeting all the dogs along the way!"
131,2018-05-29,[''],Very crowded! But still fun. And it was memorial day weekend.
132,2018-05-29,['hiking'],"If you are by the area it's worth it, for me it was quite a drive. It's a quick hike, it does have some incline but it's not too bad - you'll be there in no time. You can go over the waterfall and enjoy the overlook."
133,2018-05-20,['hiking'],"Love this hike and waterfall. It was great, even in January years ago for our engagement pictures. We've taken kids and dogs and everyone always has a good time."
134,2018-05-18,['hiking'],Love this hike!!
135,2018-05-15,['hiking'],Good short hike with a nice water feature at the end. You can keep going pass the waterfall however I didn't go pass the waterfall. It's definitely rocky and not tons of shade.
136,2018-05-11,[''],Such a good hike! Just coming back from having a baby and this was a great fun hike to get me motivated to kick my butt into hiking mode
137,2018-05-11,['hiking'],"It was good. Maybe a little more difficult for the first hike for someone that hasn't been out all winter, like me. there's a steady incline all the way to the top, but not extremely difficult. There were lots of moms on the trail with their children. I just had to stop periodically and catch my breath. It's kind of a short hike, only 2.5 miles. Shady along the trail and very comfortable weather wise. I'm glad I did it!"
138,2018-04-28,['hiking'],This trail provides a lot of beautiful views but make sure you pack plenty of water! If you're not careful it'll kick your butt lol
139,2018-04-24,[''],Nice quick hike.   Loved the falls.
140,2018-04-24,[''],Fun and easy hike with some steep inclines but all the falls are worth seeing.
141,2018-04-22,[''],"Great for family home evening. Also, more adventurous guests can repel there. Bravo nature! Bravo!"
142,2018-04-10,['hiking'],"Great hike, the main waterfall is about 100 yds past the bridge and at that point feel that it goes from easy to moderate. The falls are beautiful! Rest of the hike up to the end of the red trail marker it moderate. Seeing all the smaller falls makes it worth it. Plan or doing the big loop here and hitting the peak, won’t be till next month but we may even camp."
143,2018-04-01,[''],Awesome !! ❤️❤️
144,2018-03-27,[''],Did this just this past Saturday. Went past the 1.4 mile maker by about half a mile. I’d really like to do the full Battle Creek Grove Creek loop soon.
145,2018-03-15,[''],"This falls is a great family hike, and the kids love to stand under the 50 foot falls and get wet.  It is also a favorite for those learning how to rappel.  There is often people at the top repelling  down the side of the waterfall.  To get to the falls, you take the Pleasant Grove Utah exit 275. Turn east, and follow the road up to 100 E in Pleasant Grove.  Turn right to 200 S, then turn left (east).  Follow the road all the way to the top where there is a parking lot, and the trail head.  The hike starts kinda dry and hot, but it as soon as you get up to where the water is not piped in, it gets greener and cooler.  It is only about 1 mile up to the falls, and there is is cool and a delightful area to explore.  If you have more time, you can hike past the falls, and right off the bat you will see 2 more pretty waterfalls.   The hike above is steeper but if you go up about another mile there is a spot where the river gets wide, Rocky and very shallow.  There is a sign here and there is a trail that heads over to Dry Creek Canyon.  If you go from here up about another half mile it gets a little steeper and narrow, but you end up coming to a T in the trail.  The right side heads to Baldy or connects also with Dry Canyon.  The left side gets up to a dirt road that you can drive all the way out to American Fork Canyon.  I usually walk the road for just a little while and then head off on a small trail through the meadow that heads down Grove Creek Canyon, and right by Indian Springs.   This canyon was named because a tribe of Indians used to live up in this meadow.  Some squirmish happened with the Indians and the Pioneer settlers and there really was a battle between the two that happened at the base of Battle Creek Canyons.   A beautiful canyon with spectacular cliffs, beautiful waterfalls, and a bonus that you are very close to the river almost the whole hike.  Here is a 360 stitch of the hike up until the turn off towards Dry Canyon.  http://shaunasadventures.blogspot.com/2018/02/360-adventure-battle-creek-canyon.html?m=1"
146,2018-02-18,['hiking'],"Fun, easy, and scenic! A must for families. The waterfall is beautiful and weather was great! Didn’t go past the falls but was fun. Did a Vlog of it on you tube if you want to see it. “Daydreamer” is the channel “Hiking to Battle Creek falls” is the title."
147,2018-02-07,[''],It’s a good hike to go on with friends and family!
148,2018-02-04,[''],"Nice up and back, a little bit of a challenge around the falls and above. The trail is clear of snow and ice. Nice scenery with a the pleasant sound of the flowing creek."
149,2018-01-14,['hiking'],This trail continues up for quite a ways past the bottom falls. Follows the river up. Good steep climb. I ended up turning around at 2 miles as I had to get back. I’ll go again and continue up further. Trail dry for the most part.
150,2018-01-13,[''],One of my faves!!
151,2018-01-13,[''],"Great, quick hike. Steep and icy, but otherwise, beautiful."
152,2018-01-02,['hiking'],"Nice little hike up to a cool (literally) waterfall.  There was no snow on the trail, but there were some icy patches since there is quite a bit of shade on the trail.  But the ice didn’t get in the way of our good time.  The kids did great, and the icy waterfall was a nice reward."
153,2018-01-02,['hiking'],It’s more of a road rather than a trail until you get above the falls. Super easy and suitable for kids.
154,2017-12-31,['walking'],"Fun, easy and a great hike for a quick morning walk."
155,2017-12-28,['hiking'],Such a fun hike in the snow. I can't wait to rappel the waterfall. I would suggest spikes once you get to the first waterfall.
156,2017-12-27,[''],Love this hike.

166,2017-09-15,['hiking'],"Did this trail alongside the G Mountain Trail July 18, 2016 - just now downloading this app. This is my Dad's backyard (literally!) and what a beautiful way to spend my last day visiting him! Pretty trafficked when we went but not too difficult of a climb. There were lots of toddlers hiking this when we went. The falls are beautiful and I look forward to hiking this again and exploring past the trail end sign."

171,2017-08-14,[''],"An easy, short trail!
Do not wake up super early (as I did) to avoid the sun. The trail has no sun until 9ish! 
Before 9h there was absolutely no one. People arrived with the sun, but it did not feel that crowded to me, and I stayed around until 11h. 
I kept hiking for 1more mile (I had to walk twice  through some big branches to cross the river. I will post pics. I would not recommend that for kids) and I found a sign to ""dry canyon"". Has someone been there from here?"
172,2017-08-08,['hiking'],"It's definitely better to go in the morning, because there's some spots with no shade that make it pretty hot. I've been in the late afternoon and in the morning, and it seemed a lot easier in the morning because it was much cooler in comparison. There are some dusty and rocky parts, but it's a good hike and the waterfall is refreshing."
173,2017-08-08,[''],Good trail. Fun for kids.
174,2017-08-03,['hiking'],"My friend and I were looking for a hike that was quick but not too easy, and this fit the bill perfectly! It's pretty steep for a couple stretches, but it's short enough that it's easily accessible for all skill levels. The falls are pretty, but our favorite part was after the recorded trail ended when we crossed the stream and hiked alongside it as far as we could! On a Sunday evening it wasn't too crowded, and we got to watch the sunset from up in the mountains which is always a plus."
175,2017-08-02,[''],good trail. crowded up to first big falls.
176,2017-08-01,[''],It's a good trail. Family friendly with a lot of people. I believe the entire trail is paved

185,2017-07-10,[''],"Great family day hike. Pretty short. Moderate incline. 4 year old did great. Lots of stops for him to climb the little side hills and slide down. Of course, throw some rocks in the water too. Will be doing this again when fam comes into town."
186,2017-07-05,['hiking'],Fun in spring and early summer while it is still green. Also nice in the fall if you want to go all the way up to the meadow on top of the foothill.

191,2017-06-14,[''],Great for families!
192,2017-06-11,['hiking'],It's all uphill on the way to the falls. The Creek wasn't running all the way down as I was told was usual. It was falling into a drain about half way up. The fall had a good flow today. Good trail to figure your fitness level on.
193,2017-06-05,['hiking'],Fun short hike to the falls. Be careful up top with kids and dogs. It's a great view for the distance. Crowds weren't bad on a Sunday.
194,2017-06-04,['hiking'],"This trail is great for families with kids, for groups, or for people who don't want a very strenuous hike.

This trail gets very crowded in the summer, but that makes for a fun, festive feeling around the falls. If you go on the fall, early spring, or on a rainy day you can have have a much quieter experience."
195,2017-05-31,['hiking'],"Very busy, lots of kids and dogs. Short hike with not much to see. Great for young kids or inexperienced hikers. If you continue past the falls the hike really gets better."

197,2017-05-29,[''],beautiful hike! didn't get as high as we would have liked but we had many toddlers in tow.
198,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"A great hike to start your day. The falls are beautiful, but it just keeps getting better the farther up you go. I like to take my trekking poles along on this hike. They're really helpful with the steep incline and on the rocky trail."

200,2017-05-28,[''],"Had a great time with my daughters and nephews on this hike.  While it is a short hike, it is uphill the entire way. 636 ft gain over .7 miles...but because it is so short it is over before kids get crabby about it. Had a great time playing in the waterfall.  Lots of people...lots of dogs....most pet owners are responsible, others make a bad name for all the others and remind me why I like the hikes where dogs aren't allowed. Anyway, totally recommend."
201,2017-05-28,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. Very easy. Great with kids! Waterfall is amazing. Very scenic.
202,2017-05-27,['hiking'],I really like this trail. The best part comes after the falls. As you get Higher be sure to look behind you for great views. The trails in Battle Creek are rocky until about 1.6 miles up. But I went to the intersection with dry canyon trail and they were dry and in good shape.
203,2017-05-26,['hiking'],"Super easy, super fun! When I went it wasn't very busy"

209,2017-05-08,[''],"Pretty good incline that is a lot of fun. only issue, because it's so close to town, highly populated with a fair amount of inconsiderate hikers, i.e. hikers with dogs that don't pick up after the dogs."
210,2017-05-07,['hiking'],"Fun hike, but I would NOT classify this as easy. It is moderate. The whole hike is uphill and there are parts that are a bit tricky where the shale rock is steep and slippery. There were tons of people here with dogs and young kids. Go early before it gets too hot. The falls are really pretty and the water is cool and refreshing to wade in. Fun hike for the fam!"
211,2017-05-07,[''],Great for a very short hike to the waterfall. My dog loves the water! Beautiful scenery at the top of the waterfall. you can go a little further and find a quieter place to play in the water. Done this one many times.

213,2017-05-04,['hiking'],I just love this hike! A beautiful waterfall at the end and not too long or difficult at all. It gets a little more steep at the end but only for a few minutes.
214,2017-05-04,['hiking'],Fun little hike up to the falls. There are some anchors bolted up top that you can use to rappel down. Fun and easily accessible.

233,2017-03-10,['hiking'],Hiked March 9th. Trail was excellent. There was only one little spot with snow. Love hiking this in early early spring to avoid all the people and the heat. Only passed two or three groups and the weather was perfect.
234,2017-03-08,['hiking'],"Great quick hike with my two sons, aged 7 and 12.  Not too long, not too hard, just right.  Someone needs to take that bra out of one of the trees.  Near the waterfall it was steep enough to necessitate  rubber friction nub rug laid on portions of the trail."
235,2017-03-06,['hiking'],Fun little hike for the kids and dogs. Even my 3 year old did it!

238,2017-02-09,[''],This was a fun and easy trail. Lots of great views. I was only a little disappointed in the waterfall at the end. It was hard to climb up to with a lot of slippery rocks in the way. Then the falls themselves weren't the best I've seen. But still a great fun hike that I would probably do again.
239,2017-02-01,['hiking'],"the hike up to the falls was a pretty simple one and only become steep when you approached the waterfall but it is definitely worth it. My four year old had a good time and even did this trail when he was three and still had a good time, did not need to carry him."

I have never hiked this trail in winter so I wasn't sure what to expect. Started at Grove Creek Trailhead.

I went on a sunny day, about a week after the last snowfall. The snow was fairly packed for most of the trail and I was able to hike without snowshoes. I slipped a few times (especially coming down) but it was manageable. 

I would recommend snowshoes and wish I'd had a pair (especially for some narrow sections), but if you're not the first on the trail, you should be okay!"

251,2016-09-22,['hiking'],"It's pretty much uphill the whole way to the falls, but a nice steady incline. Great for dogs and there is a little dammed pond they can swim in. There are doggie poop bags at the trailhead, but unfortunately a lot of dog owners aren't using them. There is dog poop everywhere. The falls are very pretty and makes you feel like you are out in nature even though it's not that far."

253,2016-09-15,['hiking'],"Did this with the family in July. Kids were 6, 8 and 11. Plenty of water flowing. Nice falls. When you get to the falls, it's a steep slope down to the base of the waterfall and there are not a lot of flat areas to stand. Both times I've been there, there were large groups of people. Other than that, it was fun. You can also continue the trail upwards to the top of the falls. We did this, but it was nerve wracking with the kids as the trail above the falls goes along the edge of the cliff (but it's about 8 feet wide, so plenty of space). The kids of course also wanted to play in the pool of water at the top of the waterfall and were disappointed when I wouldn't let them. Plenty of parking at the trailhead. You can also hike the G if you follow the other trail from the lot."
254,2016-09-14,[''],Easy easy easy. What a great hike for little ones with a fun waterfall they can get right up into as the reward at the end. So accessible and you can keep on going up if you want to connect to more challenging hikes!;)
255,2016-09-10,['hiking'],"Nice short hike, with a couple steep patches.  Not long ones, but something people with bad knees should know about before heading up.  Most of the hike is super simple, but those stretches had me huffing and puffing.  Beautiful falls!  Pretty hike.  Will do it again."

265,2016-08-21,[''],Super easy
266,2016-08-17,[''],I loved it. Unfortunately I am not very fit. So I thought I would die before I reached the falls. But I didn't and it was worth it.
267,2016-08-17,['hiking'],"Nice hike. This one is rated as ""easy"". You gain over 600 feet of elevation on this trail. That's ""easy"" for people who are in shape. For real people, it's gonna be a workout. Take plenty of cold water, or a filter, and a fresh pair of socks. Relax and soak your feet in the creek when you get there."
268,2016-08-16,[''],Beautiful easy hike
269,2016-08-08,[''],Love this short trail
270,2016-08-02,['hiking'],My first hike in many years. Short and sweet.
271,2016-08-01,[''],Easy hike for the kids with a beautiful destination. Waterfall is gorgeous.
272,2016-07-31,['hiking'],Quick and easy - beautiful scenery at the falls
273,2016-07-30,[''],great for the family!
274,2016-07-30,['hiking'],It was easy and the waterfall was pretty.
275,2016-07-26,[''],fun hike pretty easy good workout
276,2016-07-25,[''],fun one to bring the kids. repelling down the waterfall was awesome!
277,2016-07-21,['hiking'],"Short, fun hike. Pretty flat until you reach the river, then it gets steep- but not far to get to the falls. And the waterfall is great. Trail keeps going up and beyond the falls, following the river."
278,2016-07-19,['hiking'],We had a blast. We were not satisfied with just the lower falls so we kept hiking up the hill.  Next trip we need to take a whole day and follow the trail.
279,2016-07-17,['hiking'],Great little hike and you can cool off under the waterfall.
280,2016-07-17,['hiking'],"This trail was harder than expected. My family did a lot of hiking growing up and we even hiked the Grand Canyon from rim to rim (18 miles in one day) when I was 13. I haven't hiked in years so I'm a bit out of shape. The hike to the waterfall was quite the work out. It is all up hill and I had to rest, briefly, several times. I would not say that this hike is easy for beginners but it is definitely a trail you want to try. The waterfall at the end is worth it!"
281,2016-07-13,[''],"One of my favorite hikes! Perfect for a hot summer day! It gets pretty steep just before the waterfall, but totally worth it!"
282,2016-07-11,[''],Kid friendly. Wear gym shoes and clothes you don't care about.
283,2016-07-10,[''],Way fun!!!
284,2016-07-10,[''],fun for kids
285,2016-07-07,[''],"this is not a beautiful trail but it is good trail for a quick hike with the kids. it is easily accessible and the waterfall is fun to play in and cool off, which is great because the hike is hot and dusty. my kids like hiking back down the trail through the river.  there is not a good place to picnic by the waterfall (too steep, Rocky and dirty) but there is a pavilion with picnic tables at the trail head. keep your picnic in a cooler at the car and then eat in the shade when you finish the hike. there always seems to be a fair amount of hikers on this trail at any given time."
286,2016-07-07,['hiking'],It's an easy trail great for small kids with a beautiful water fall at the end.
287,2016-07-03,[''],"This trail is pretty easy, it takes about 30 mins or less to the waterfall. The waterfall is pretty. You can go on top of the waterfall and take the pic, it's great view. After that we decided to go up more, but I didn't see anything interesting! So I would recommend stop at that waterfall."
288,2016-07-03,[''],This hike was so hard. I couldn't even make it half way where I needed to call it quits and go home. thank God there are plenty of pictures in the internet if this waterfall cause I'll never make it up there. worst hike ever!
289,2016-06-30,[''],"My family loves this trail. Our daughters (5 and 7) have no trouble making it to the falls. They also love the ""bear cave"" on the trail. We are usually in and out in 2 hours or less."
290,2016-06-30,['hiking'],Did this trail last night with the family.  it is pretty short but very steep.  Beautiful falls that was cool and refreshing.
291,2016-06-29,[''],Too hot with not enough shade. No water in the reservoir. Didn't make it up to any waterfall. Hunkered down in a trickle of a stream under a footbridge for shade and water.
292,2016-06-26,[''],Awesome hike for the family.
293,2016-06-26,['hiking'],Great! So easy we did it twice. We saw some friends at the bottom as we were finishing and decided took back up. We have a 5 year old and an 18 month old in a backpack.
294,2016-06-26,['hiking'],Excellent for the family
295,2016-06-24,[''],Nice kid friendly hike. It's shaded about 1/2 way  through. It was pretty crowded when we went midday. People were repelling off the side of the falls. There's a lot of dirt up at the falls . I wasn't prepared for that as my younger kids got real dirty from playing in it and then getting wet. There's a pavilion in the beginning of the trail which made it nice for us to relax and eat lunch afterwards.
296,2016-06-23,['hiking'],"I really enjoyed this hike. I took my son with me. Both of us have medical conditions that make it moderate in level for us. However, we loved it. We would definitely do this again. Next time we will introduce the puppy to waterfall."
297,2016-06-23,['hiking'],"I am a beginner when it comes to hiking so a trail marked as ""easy"" might even be difficult for me. However, I completed this hike with my husband and enjoyed it a lot. We had to stop a few times so I could catch my breath and rest my thigh muscles but aside from that it was great. The view from the top is gorgeous and you hit the waterfall right when you think you can't go any further."
298,2016-06-22,[''],I do this hike every year. It's very easy and great to go as a starter hike.
299,2016-06-21,['hiking'],"Good for kids, not too hard even carrying a child"
300,2016-06-21,['hiking'],Loved it. Exactly what we needed. Short easy hike.
301,2016-06-21,['hiking'],Great hike for family and children. There are a few cool little waterfalls above the main waterfall you can even go check out.
302,2016-06-20,[''],"Great trail. Loved all the trees, shade and waterfalls. Would do it again."
303,2016-06-20,[''],"This is a great family/dog hike! My kids love hiking to some sort of destination... rock formation, waterfall, etc. so this is great."
304,2016-06-19,[''],easy hike - great for any level hiker.
305,2016-06-18,[''],went past the falls and continued up the canyon. A lot of elevation climbing but beautiful scenery.
306,2016-06-18,[''],"My kids, even the little ones, really enjoyed this hike. It took us a LONG time because we have little kids. Great trail with a really fun payoff art the end. The falls are beautiful."
307,2016-06-12,['hiking'],Great trail!  Lots of waterfalls if you continue past the main one.
308,2016-06-12,[''],"Dog friendly. Very easy slope, gets slightly steep right before the waterfall. Good shade most of the way."
309,2016-06-10,['hiking'],"The trail is pretty uninteresting for the first half up, but the Falls are well
worth it.  My four year old needed
some ( a lot) of coaxing on the way up, but had a great time."
310,2016-06-10,[''],Easy hike. Steep in some parts toward the end. Did this with my 4 and 2 year old boys. They loved the base of the waterfall. I had to hold onto their hands on some portions of the trail that had a steep edge.
311,2016-06-09,[''],Went back in Feb and there was still snow. Waterfalls was beautiful
312,2016-06-07,['hiking'],Steady climb but short. Not the prettiest hike until you get to the falls which are tall and cool!
313,2016-06-06,[''],Great trail! It was a bit steeper than we expected but worth the climb to the waterfall.
314,2016-06-06,['hiking'],This trail was rather steep in my opinion. It's a constant incline the whole way up. It's definitely worth it and the hike back is very nice. It's also not that long so that's a plus! Very cool hike to cross off the list!
315,2016-06-05,['hiking'],"Wide trail, easygoing and great hiking with young kids. The waterfall was beautiful and the kids loved playing."
316,2016-06-04,['hiking'],Hiked this with my toddler in his pack. Easy trail with a few steep parts and a fun area to play for the kids at the waterfall.
317,2016-06-03,['hiking'],"It was a quick, easy hike. Very simple, especially since I'm a beginner. The hike becomes a bit steep at the end, but well worth it to get to the waterfall."
318,2016-06-02,['hiking'],hiking with Maggi.
319,2016-05-31,['backpacking'],"A decent trail, but not my favorite in Utah. Depending on the time and day of the week, it can be VERY crowded. Once you get above the falls, the number of people starts to thin out and it gets prettier."
320,2016-05-31,[''],"Good trail, lots of people and very few people keep their dogs on leash. Aside from the crowds and too much dog feces left uncleaned up- this is a pretty good hike for kids and very close to Utah Valley."
321,2016-05-31,[''],Nice waterfall but there are a lot of people on the trail.
322,2016-05-30,[''],Make sure you schedule plenty of time for the kids to play in the creek! Quick easy hike.
323,2016-05-29,[''],Fun family hike. Very busy trail
324,2016-05-24,[''],Good for a quick short hike to a waterfall
325,2016-05-22,[''],Good with young kids but the trail is pretty crowded.
326,2016-05-20,['hiking'],"Great hike for beginners. Only gets steep for the last 50 yards. Not the best waterfall around, but it was pretty good for how short the trail is."
327,2016-05-11,['hiking'],Nice easy little hike. Great for families with little kids. Hike gets a little steep the closer you get to the falls. I recommend continuing up past the falls into the canyon. Gets steeper and there are smaller falls above and the scenery is great. I took my special needs son on this hike and he did pretty well even with the steep parts.
328,2016-05-10,[''],"Very short Trail doesn't take very long to go up and back. If your wanting something short that the whole family can do this is your hike. I think on any fitness level will be capable, meaning you don't need to be in great shape to do this. One note is that it's extremely busy. We even went on a Thursday in the afternoon and there was a ton of people. So just know that if you go on a Saturday I'm sure it'll be extremely busy. It's too short for my liking and too busy for my liking but it's a nice option for all the family to do."
329,2016-05-07,[''],The water fall was cooler than I expected.
330,2016-04-23,[''],Nice easy trail to waterfalls.
331,2016-04-21,[''],"Super easy, but worth it for the waterfalls!"
332,2016-04-17,[''],"Great hike, just keep going past the falls"
333,2016-04-10,['hiking'],Easy to follow trail to a nice waterfall
334,2016-04-10,['hiking'],Some cool waterfalls along the way. Fun hike.
335,2016-04-10,[''],Great for kids and families
336,2016-04-02,['hiking'],Such a great hike for small kids. A little steep towards the very end of the hike. If your kids like to throw rocks into water then this is your place.
337,2016-03-27,[''],Great hike with the kids. Still a little snow at the bottom of the waterfall. Pack a lunch and enjoy a picnic at the falls.
338,2016-03-25,['hiking'],"Beautiful and easy hike. I've repelled down the waterfall because there are hooks at the top you can latch onto, and the trail continues up past the waterfall. I go during the summer and stand under the water for a quick refresher!"
339,2016-03-19,['walking'],"Short and fairly easy for kids. Went with my cousin and her two little ones. The 4 year old had a slightly rough time on the steep parts because of slippery rock fragments like ultra large gravel. But overall he was fine and loved the waterfall. She hiked with a 2 year old on her back and did ok. The steepness got to us at the end but only for a second. If you're really out of shape, it will get to you. It's steep! I was breathing super heavy and am somewhat of a couch potato. But it's still doable quickly. Mostly shaded in the late afternoon and evenings. I don't know about morning."
340,2016-03-13,[''],"kind of steep for the couch potatoes among us, but short and doable for all. recommend a walking stick."
341,2016-03-12,['hiking'],First hike of the season today. Watched the sunset from the falls. Great as always.
342,2016-02-29,[''],Awesome
343,2016-01-20,[''],"More of a short walk than a hike, but you can keep going past the falls on the Baldie trail, which is significantly more difficult"
344,2016-01-03,[''],Good for family with kid. Easy hiking and beautiful snow.
345,2015-11-05,['hiking'],Nice easy hike great for beginners or family's with young children
346,2015-10-24,['hiking'],"I really liked that you get so close to the running water for much of the trail. My two little kids enjoyed the trail also. The scenery is not as exciting as other hikes around here, but the falls are very pretty. I think it's certainly worth your time--at least once."
347,2015-09-26,[''],A great hike for kids! Beautiful waterfall at the end!
348,2015-09-24,[''],Such an easy and fun hike. Definitely recommended!
349,2015-09-23,[''],Easy to walk
350,2015-08-30,['hiking'],Great family trail!
351,2015-08-29,[''],My 2 year old loved it!
352,2015-08-29,['hiking'],"Lots of water for the end of August. Our kids did great, kid friendly should really be an attribute for this trail. 4yo walked the whole time, 2yo needed help, but walked a majority of it."
353,2015-08-26,['hiking'],Really cool waterfall. Tends to be crowded during peak times. Definitely worth doing.
354,2015-08-22,[''],Great short hike with nice waterfall at the end. Fun to do in the winter.
355,2015-08-20,['hiking'],Nice little hike. Good way to get an hour or two of life to pass by.
356,2015-08-16,[''],Great waterfall. Very surprised how much water was coming over in Aug. Hike was steep for my little ones but they loved the waterfall.
357,2015-08-09,[''],Great hike for kids!
358,2015-08-06,[''],"Nice, steep hike. It's best to arrive early in the morning as it does get crowded."
359,2015-08-03,['hiking'],"Popular hike for families with young children. At 1.6 miles roundtrip, you can do the hike in just over an hour. Battle Creek Falls is a great place to cool off during the summer months.

360,2015-07-30,['hiking'],"Short hike, lots of other families with kids in packs, pretty falls, and some good places to play in the stream with little kids."
361,2015-07-18,[''],One of my favorites. Easy to get to and awesome to see!
362,2015-07-14,['camping'],The hike to the falls is great just a bit steep nearing the falls took my small kids and they did fine! Later took twenty teen girls repelling down the falls and it was perfect for all skill levels. Then we hiked up towards curly spring it was a bit more difficult and had to camp near trail. Amazing view!
363,2015-07-13,[''],Not my favorite hike but the falls are pretty.
364,2015-07-03,['walking'],"The hike is just a small piece of a larger trail. Wide enough for several people to walk together, the only spots that are to be wary of are the hike to the top and the bottom of the waterfall."
365,2015-06-30,[''],"Easy, close to civilization. Really pretty"
366,2015-06-27,[''],This is a good morning hike or a good evening family hike. Although it really isn't a hike...more like a walk. Short and sweet.
367,2015-06-24,['hiking'],"Great for a short hike up to a waterfall.  The trail is pretty easy up to the falls.  There were a lot of little kids there when we hiked it.  They were having a great time in the waterfall.  For a little extra fun, hike down the creek instead of using the trail for the return hike."
368,2015-06-20,[''],"Great quick morning hike. Well traveled, expect others enjoying this hike with you."
369,2015-06-18,['cross country skiing'],"Went today for the first time. The hike to the falls itself is very short. Towards the falls it starts to get more steep and it is very rocky. Like large bits of gravel. Not the best for trail running going up, but I did run going down. Great hike for kids seven and older. Good for five-year-olds you would just have to hold their hand at certain parts. A three-year-old could walk most of the way but you would just have to hold them as you approach the falls. Walking at a fast pace it only took 10 minutes to get to the falls. I suggest hiking beyond the falls, there are some great places for to stop for lunch there!"
370,2015-06-16,['hiking'],"this was my first attempt at taking all 5 of my sons on a hike alone. ages ranging from 10 years to 8 months. We had success with very minimal meltdowns from my 4yo. once we got to the waterfall, I think we spent at least 45 minutes there. then, on the way back, they all thanked me for bringing them to this hike:) well worth the drive and perfect start to my summer goal of 1 hike per week. this is 1 of 12:)"
371,2015-06-14,['hiking'],This trail has a steady incline up to the falls. If you aren't in great health it may be strenuous. Our kids loved the falls and walking in the creek. We were also able to bring our two dogs with us. It is a very busy trail. Lots of fun beautiful views.
372,2015-06-13,['hiking'],Great easy hike with kids and dogs...
373,2015-06-06,[''],"I hike this almost every Saturday. It's short, a little steep at the end but not terrible. Plus the waterfall is amazing!"
374,2015-06-05,[''],"Quick hike with a great payoff at the waterfall. All of the elevation increase is in the last quarter mile, but it has a great view of the waterfall at that point so if you need to stop and take a break you couldn't pick a better place to do so. Also, you can go up close to both the bottom and top of the waterfall. Only takes a half hour to an hour to do so you don't have to plan a day around it. Check it out!"
375,2015-06-02,['hiking'],This was one of the first hikes where the directions were enough to actually get me there. It was an absolutely amazing hike. Partial shade/partial sun. It was 0.73 miles to the falls and it was a breathtaking sight. It was great considering it was a short hike with a huge payout. My 7 and 4 year old did great and loved playing in the stream below the falls. We'll be doing this one again for sure.
376,2015-05-25,[''],Good little family hike
377,2015-05-08,['hiking'],"It was okay. The falls are pretty cool, but I don't have much of a desire to do it again. It is fine if you are pretty bored, or don't feel like hiking a very long distance."
378,2015-04-22,['hiking'],"Battle Creek Falls is short hike that packs a punch. Usually, when a trail is short I am skeptical of it because I'm worried it will be boring or overdeveloped. I really like to get out into the wilderness when I hike. However, this trail actually exceeded my expectations! So much so that I wrote a post titled ""20 Reasons to Hike Battle Creek Falls!"" Check out my blog post about it with photos and a video of the falls here: http://wanderookie.com/blog/2015/04/22/20-reasons-to-hike-battle-creek-falls/"
379,2015-04-12,[''],"just did this hike today.  (have done it before)  Was surprised how low the water levels were.    My husband and I both used Run Keeper to track the hike.  According to RK - it was NOT 1.8 miles, His said 1.4, mine said 1.33.  (this was after the complete trip.  Still a nice hike. just not the almost 2 miles we were going for.  :)"
380,2015-04-04,['hiking'],"Maybe it was just wrong timing, but it wasn't as beautiful as these pics! The hike was a good short intense, but maybe I will try going during the summer when the leaves grow in! It just seemed very ugly compared to the other hikes I've been on! Will come back again!"
381,2015-03-30,['hiking'],"Great little hike to get the kids out of the house and out in nature. Pretty busy, but the trail is wide in most places allowing plenty of room to work around fellow hikers."
382,2015-03-20,['hiking'],"I hike this trail often in the early morning before heading into work. It's a nice little trail, just steep enough to get a decent workout, but not to kill you."
383,2014-10-26,['hiking'],"Easy, short hike that has an impressive waterfall to reward you at the end. The last .1-.2 miles were pretty steep, but the rest of the hike initially is mostly flat and easy. You're able to get right underneath the falls, and you can also continue along the trail and head right next to the crest. This is a great hike to take the pup along with, as they'll love the water at the falls. Took me 35 minutes roundtrip. Moderate cover along most of the hike. Trailhead is easy to find, plenty of parking, and trail is well maintained, although there is some washout of the trail near the very end ascending to the crest."
384,2014-10-11,['hiking'],"Came up Dry Creek, topped Big Baldy then descended into Battle Creek. Fun hike with excellent views of Timpanogos and South Valley, when the air is clear enough one can see Mt. Nebo and Deseret Peak as well. We did this during the fall season, and the colors were nothing shy of amazing and spectacular. The Battle Creek side would be great if pressed for time!"
385,2014-09-03,['hiking'],"did this trail with my daughter as we were pressed for time and wanted a short hike. very nice trail with a beautiful stream and waterfalls. if you go early, there are not many people.  Wonderful before, especially on the way back out. highly recommended if you can't hike very far our if you don't have much time."
386,2014-08-30,['hiking'],"Really liked this trail with the dogs (all dogs on leash). Went midday on a Friday for a quick stretch of legs as we drove through. Only saw four other groups (couples, families). Lots of little paths at the beginning to go on adventures. Be sure to wear sun protection, stable shoes and bring plenty of water."
387,2014-08-10,['hiking'],"A very pleasant simple hike with a bounty of wildlife and water all the way through. A little too busy a trail for me & the dog, but plenty of off-trail jaunts to escape the general tourist streams"
388,2014-07-30,['hiking'],"Easy, pretty hike, although I didn't spend much time at the falls because there was a family doing pirate/mermaid themed group pictures so I didn't want to intrude..."
389,2014-07-29,[''],I did this as a night hike so I didn't get to see the beauty of the falls.  I do plan to go back again during the day.  It's a beautiful hike.  It seems heavily trafficked.  Even at night there were a lot of people on the trail.
390,2014-07-19,[''],"Did this hike this morning, there were a bunch of other families there but it wasn't too crowded. We loved it. The falls were very pretty and fun to get wet in. Very easy, short hike. Up hill the whole way there but down going back. I will definitely visit this place again."
391,2014-07-16,['hiking'],I did this as a night hike and it was beautiful.  I obviously couldn't see the falls but I was able to enjoy all of the other beauties that are in the area.
392,2014-06-07,['hiking'],"It's a pretty easy hike, not too steep.  There's a spot, right before arriving at the falls that is steep but other than that it's not too bad.  This is a very short hike if all you're doing is going to the falls and back; you're there before you know it.  We hiked past the falls and there were quite a few pretty little falls in the creek as you got up.  The view in some spots coming down is totally awesome.  I'll plan on going quite a bit farther past the falls next time.  Plenty of shady places so you don't necessarily have to go early in the morning.  Dog friendly and plenty of places for the dog to drink as well."
393,2014-05-18,['hiking'],"This trail is really busy! I prefer solitude when hiking and I felt like I was in the line to magic mountain at Disney land when doing this hike. Also, it should be noted that the trail length is wrong on here. It currently says this is 1.8 miles. In reality it's 0.70 miles. The trail continues up after the falls and gets more difficult if you're up to a challenge. About two miles farther there is some great camping and trails that connect to either dry canyon (head south at fork), or Indian springs/ grove creek (head north at fork). I used this trail to head up to big baldy and camped on the saddle overlooking the city.  There's a lot more water access this way than if you head up the dry canyon route, but this trail is the steepest of the three. This trail was very busy so don't come here to get away from things. The falls are nice, but not spectacular. I wouldn't do this trail again, except to pass it on the way to the more backcountry trails below timp. If you are using thus trail to loop from another trail I suggest coming down this trail not up because of how steep it is."
394,2014-05-17,[''],This was a nice short hike for me and the girls (6 & 3). It was a little steeper then I had thought it would be but not bad. The water fall was great. Probably would not do this one again but it's definitely worth going at least once. According the my GPS it was only 1.53 miles out and back.
395,2014-05-14,['hiking'],"Mother's Day 2014. Great day for hiking up to approx. 9400'...lot of clouds and it snowed on me. I was a bit disappointed in the ""falls."" With everything I had heard of it I thought it would be bigger and I got to it much sooner than I thought I would. Great hike tho; 2 1/2 hours up and 1 1/2 hour back down. Got a photo of a deer which was exciting - my first big ""game"" photo in Utah. Very thrilling experience as a whole."
396,2013-08-31,['hiking'],"Busy to the first fall, take the kids and enjoy the view. If you continue up the trail you finds a few other smaller falls and a split in the trail, you can continue up battle and switch back all the way to the saddle of big baldy, or you can hit the right and go to Curley springs (eventually dry canyon), ad hit up the saddle from that side. There's a lot o water up this side, it's beautiful and fairly steep. Places for hammocks and tents all the way up. One of my favorites :)"
397,2013-08-09,['hiking'],"Beautiful falls and a great family hike. Not too strenuous and reasonably short. Hot and dusty trail, but near water most of the way. "
398,2013-08-07,['hiking'],"My kids and I love this hike.  The kids like to play in the water under the waterfall, so we always take clothes that can get wet."
399,2013-07-03,['hiking'],Took the scouts there tonight. Had a great time. Found out there's rappelling anchors at the top! Might have to come back with the ropes. :)
400,2013-06-04,['hiking'],Had a great hike with the family.  Took the dog to.  The falls a re a great pay off at the end    
401,2013-05-30,['hiking'],"Great hike. The trail to the falls is easy and short. The hike gets better, in my opinion, if you continue on past the falls. The creek has some beautiful cascades and it eventually opens up to some breathtaking meadows and great views of the valley."
402,2013-05-23,['hiking'],This is a fairly easy hike with a big payoff. I have done this several times with my kids (ages 2-10) and they all did fine. It is neat to continue up past the falls on the trail for some great views of Utah County.
403,2013-05-21,['hiking'],I have been on moderate marked trails that were easier than this one.  I liked it. The falls were nice although I don't think we made it all the way... there was still trail left.
404,2013-05-17,['hiking'],"My little kids, ages 8 and 3 loved this hike! It's easy and beautiful!"
405,2013-05-17,['hiking'],Great for our young family'
406,2013-05-15,['hiking'],"I hiked up to the waterfall on memorial day and was planning on rappelling next to the waterfall (there are bolts at the top of the waterfall).  However, the waterfall was swarming with people so we decided to save the rappel for another, less crowded day.  "
407,2013-05-02,['hiking'],This was one of the first hikes I did after moving to Utah. Dog friendly. Nice canyon. Falls were nice.  
408,2012-11-06,['hiking'],"Great hike for all levels of hikers, trail can get a little busy on weekends when the weather is nice,"
409,2012-09-14,['hiking'],"The kids loved it.  The falls were super crowded on a Memorial Day hike, but it was a welcome sight from the line waiting to get in AF canyon."
410,2012-09-04,['hiking'],"My wife and I are not in good shape.  Either we took the wrong trail or wow this was a lot tougher than we expected.  We started at the bottom and walked  up the canyon and went straight up the bottom of the canyon on a dirt trail from the parking lot all the way up to the waterfall.  It was up, up, and then really up incline.  The last 25% was very steep.  More of an incline than the Timpanogas cave trail hike.  If you follow the path we took,...don't go unless you want a very moderate to difficult hike.  My wife stopped at half way and I went the rest of the way.  It was difficult. Plan on about 3 miles round trip."
411,2012-08-18,['hiking'],"Much easier and prettier than donut falls trail. This trail is family and pet friendly. You'll know you've reached the waterfall when it gets a little steep. It's also a little steep to get down to the bottom of the waterfall, but it's worth it! Took tons of photos!  You can continue the trail ahead which is more steep and narrower trails to camp. I was told the trail goes into an 8 mile loop and more mini waterfalls, however, I didn't have the time to hike the whole loop.  Definitely enjoyed it!"
412,2012-07-28,['hiking'],Fabulous trail. The grade is relatively flat until you get about 100 feet from the trail down to the waterfall when it becomes moderately steep. Bring your swim trunks because just 10 seconds in the waterfall makes the hike so much more fun.
413,2012-07-20,['hiking'],This is a really pretty hike! It's easy and the waterfall is gorgeous! 
414,2012-07-13,['hiking'],This is a quick and easy hike that could be done by all
415,2012-07-09,['hiking'],Real quick hike. Nice for something to do or for beginners.  Great pictures.  
416,2012-06-24,['hiking'],"We loved this quick hike. Nice broad trail is graveled the entire way, though there will be a difficult step up when you get to the small bridge above the water hole that might be the stopping point for some. We brought our Mini Aussie, Zo, with us. "
417,2012-06-17,['hiking'],Good hike but quite an incline near the falls. The trail gets even more steep next to the falls. There were a lot of people there on a Saturday but a great little hike. 
418,2012-06-07,['hiking'],"It was a fun, quick hike. Unless you swim in the waterhole, it is only a 1 hour hike. It's best to go early morning in the summer before it gets too hot. The waterfall is beautiful. Make sure to take the side path to get to the base of it."
419,2012-03-02,['hiking'],"Relatively easy-to-moderate hike with a great view of much of Utah Valley.  The falls provides a cool respite from the summer heat, and you're in the canyon the entire trip."
