1,2019-07-29,"['backpacking', 'bugs']",I loved this trail! The only downside was that there were so many mosquitos. But it was super scenic and the lakes were beautiful. We backpacked in about a mile and then day hiked up to the peak. Super pretty area and the weather was perfect! It was pretty steep and two of us were feeling under the weather but we just took it slow and still made it to the top! 
2,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'muddy']","7/28/19 Hardly any snow at the top near Lake Catherine and a bit muddy in other places along the trail. Went counterclockwise and had a bit of a delay due to a whole moose family (bull, cow, and 2 calves) having a mid-afternoon snack in the middle of the trail. Also saw some marmots, ground squirrels, chipmunks, and a woodpecker out today. The lakes are beautiful and the wildflowers are in bloom! Just remember bug spray for the mosquitos."
3,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'snow']","Truly an amazing hike. Take path #1 so you're going counter clockwise and there will be way fewer people. The views are excellent and while some parts are steep, you do get breaks. Helps to have bug spray and sun screen. "
4,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'snow']",Beautiful area. The views at Lake Mary and  Martha were incredible. Still lots of snow a over Lake Martha.  Lots of people on the trail up to Lake Mary.  
5,2019-07-09,['hiking'],I can’t say enough good things about this hike. The only negative comment is that it’s very poorly marked and without AllTrails it would have been very difficult to follow the route. Granted we did have a few diversions for snow and photos but it’s not a well marked trail.
6,2019-07-06,"['hiking', 'snow']",Still some snow on the trail when you get to Lake Martha and above. Spikes aren’t really necessary but helpful. It’s a little hard to navigate between Lake Mary and Twin Lakes as there is snow on this section of the trail as well. Pretty fun hike with all the lakes and being able to make a loop of it. 
7,2019-06-26,['hiking'],"I haven't done this hike yet, but would like to go on July 5.  Can anyone tell me how the snow melt is doing and does anyone recall approximately how long it took them to do the entire loop?  We have an event we have to go to in the evening. "
8,2019-06-10,['hiking'],"June 9 - This hike is completely covered in snow. It still has a couple feet left to melt. It was still a fun time if you are up for an adventure, but don’t expect to see the trail or any signs (they are still buried). We are excited to hike it again later in the summer!"
9,2018-10-13,[''],"Beautiful hike! Knee deep snow once you get to Lake Catherine, but so worth it."
10,2018-09-29,[''],Beautiful trail. Nice to take breaks around the lakes. Lots of fun! Saw moose right before getting to lake Mary. Incredible views.
11,2018-09-16,['hiking'],"Gorgeous trail. Fall leaves beginning - probably a couple weeks to peak. Few people on the trail although 10 or so eating at the lake. Hiked with a 9 yo who was awestruck by the views and had no trouble with the uphills, the rocky areas nor the gravel downhills."
12,2018-08-18,[''],"we did 4 of the lakes, well worth it. saw a huge moose about 15 paces from us, as well as a lot of other wildlife. lake mary was moderately trafficked, but catherine and the smaller one we saw only had one or two others in sight. we only saw two other people on the actual loop (they worked for the watershed) but there seemed to be people both going to mary or catherine, just not via the loop."
13,2018-08-03,[''],Loved it! Lake Mary is stunning.
14,2018-07-18,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. Fairly high traffic but still a great hike. Strenuous enough but manageable. Wildflowers everywhere. There was a big bull moose about 30 yds from the trail. Had a blast!
15,2018-07-18,[''],Fun hike. Wildflowers were still in full bloom. Intermittent shade. We saw 3 bull moose. They were right on the trail but we were able go around them.
16,2018-07-16,[''],"Great Moderate hike though first mile is steep. The first mile is highly trafficked.  Past that it gets more sparse with people till the end then your are back in crowds. Fun, beautiful."
17,2018-07-11,[''],There are a few spots where trail(s) might be more clearly marked. Views of the lakes are amazing; a bit rockier terrain as you get over toward Twin Lakes. Always good to explore some of the many side trails for great views. Great hike!!!
18,2018-07-06,['hiking'],"Gorgeous hike. Right before you get to lake Catherine and you see the trail split, make sure you go off to the right on the rocks to overlook Martha and Mary. Stunning view."
19,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"Hiked the Brighton Lakes Trail upto Catherine Pass today. Took us about 5 hours total, with a long lunch break at the Pass and quite a few stops for birding and checking out wildflowers! This is a pretty neat hike with beautiful views of Lakes Mary, Martha and Catherine from the top. While researching more after coming home I noticed that we could’ve actually made the .3 Mi spur to Sunset peak to get a great view of all the 3 Lakes together. We might be doing this again, possibly from Albion Basin."
20,2018-06-18,['hiking'],This is a great hike to do with the family. We went with our two kids (6 and 4) and easily made it to the second lake. The temperature is nice and cool even in the summer. There is a descent amount of shade once you get past the chair lifts (ski resort). Loved it!
21,2018-06-17,['hiking'],"Perfect hike on a gorgeous day!!  If you have good hiking shoes on with good traction, you will have no problem."
22,2018-06-03,[''],Love this hike. I have done it 4 times since moving to SLC. Beautiful views and good for any skill level
23,2018-05-27,['hiking'],"I only made it to Lake Mary, which was BEAUTIFUL but every person I encountered today (5/26/18) was confused about the route. I was concerned I would get lost trying to continue to the next lake. The trailhead map isn’t very helpful and if there are trail markers, they aren’t visible with all of the snow right now. I would love to do this hike again more into the summer, but now isn’t the best time."
24,2018-05-25,['hiking'],"THIS TRAIL IS INACCESSIBLE IN THE SPRING.  As are all of the trails in the Brighton Loop.  The Brighton worker I spoke with said it should be uncovered with snow by July.  It's not just slippery, it is swallowed by the snow and completely closed to hikers. Just fair warning to anyone thinking about it.  It would be glorious in the summer."
25,2017-09-28,[''],Beautiful hike. Not too physically demanding. You’re about 90% sure to see a Moose somewhere. There’s always one or two on the south side of dog lake just off the trail.
26,2017-09-26,[''],"My favorite hikes are summits, but this was a beautiful trail!"
27,2017-09-20,['hiking'],"Great hike! Saw 4 moose. Best place for moose is on south side of Dog Lake in the marshy area. As you hike to Dog Lake on east side headed south and get almost to the trail end, look in the trees on the left next to big rock outcrop. Bull moose surprised us just 25 feet away standing in the shadows eating. Maybe we were lucky because he pretty much ignored us even though there was a cow moose laying down near him. Also saw a cow with calf at the creek outlet of Lake Martha on north side of lake."
28,2017-08-28,['hiking'],"This is a great trail that shows off the many lakes in the area. Parts are a bit rocky and the elevation can be difficult for people who aren't used to hiking at altitude. It's fun to hike up to the nearby peaks if you have extra time, too!"
29,2017-08-24,[''],Easy hike and it's beautiful! We even saw a moose!
30,2017-08-10,['hiking'],Great hike today.  Saw 4 moose including 2 males with big racks at Catherine Lake.
31,2017-08-07,['hiking'],Lost the trail a couple of times on the way down from Lake Mary. Glad I had the AllTrails map to guide me. Beautiful hike.
32,2017-07-30,[''],This one is our favorite. Our tough 9 and 6 year olds can handle it (but they're used to hiking every weekend all summer).
33,2017-07-24,['hiking'],Great views the lakes a great the first mile to the first lake is the steepest but after that it wasn't bad.
34,2017-07-17,['hiking'],Beautiful trail throughout. Saw two moose right off the trail within 10 minutes of starting the hike. Recommend liberal use of bug spray.
35,2017-07-09,['hiking'],"This is my third time doing this hike--still love it! The trail is 95% clear to Lake Catherine. What snow there is, is easily passed; no special equipment is needed. Keep in mind that the trail from Twin Lakes to Lake Mary may be tricky to spot (it is not one of the wide ATV trails)."
36,2017-07-01,[''],"Still had snow in parts. Started at Silver Lake, was told the best way to go to avoid the snow. A 3 to 4 hour walk  became a 6 hour walk due to misding a turn. The hike isn't signed at all, only for skiers. They didn't have maps to give either so we had to go with the pictures I took of the wall map. Despite all this it was a BEAUTIFUL challenging walk."
37,2017-06-23,[''],"Made it to Lake Mary, still muddy and patches of snow. Too much snow to get to Martha and Catherine. The lake is full and beautiful!"
38,2017-06-10,['hiking'],"Great trail, though didnt see much of it, mostly still snow covered.  Started on twin lakes trail, got to lake and intended to cut across to Brighton lakes trail but no dice as this rookie didnt bring microspikes.  Descended and went back up Brighton Lakes trail, saw Dogwood Lake and Lake Mary, making own trail much of way as hard to follow with all the snow.  Nixed any further attempt to Lake Martha or Lake Catherine without spikes- too off axis. Lakes and views are beautiful with all the snow."
39,2016-11-19,[''],"took the lake Mary, Martha, and Catherine hike and enjoyed it every step of the way. Gorgeous views."
40,2016-09-04,[''],"I ran the Alta-Brighton Loop this morning, with a Lake Solitude add on. This loop included the Brighton Lakes route. It is always a pleasure to run this route. And the Brighton Lakes are Beautiful, even when Lake Mary has been drained (like today)"
41,2016-08-29,[''],"Lovely hike.  Started at the base next to the chairlift.  Initially was concerned we would would be surrounded by lifts, but quickly ascended to some lightly forested areas.  Lakes were pretty, although low this time of year (August).

We took the spur up to Sunset Peak which was a good workout, but doable.  It was strenuous at points!  Spectacular view from the top.

From there you can come down and complete the loop or make it an out and back if fatigued."
42,2016-08-01,['hiking'],"We began this hike close to 10:30 am and finished around 3:00 pm with a trek all the way out to Sunset Peak and tens of stops to see all the moose! The trail was pretty jam packed at first up the ski resort and I was nervous it was going to be like that the whole way, but once we hit the first lake the traffic had very much died down and it was peaceful all the way up to the top. We saw six moose on the trek and thousands of wildflowers. One of the best trails I've hiked thus far in UT!"
43,2016-07-24,['hiking'],We absolutely loved this hike!! I took my 14 yr old and 9 yr old and it was a great hike for them. The views were GORGEOUS at every turn! We saw momma and baby moose and a bull moose! The temps were amazing compared to the high heat in the valley! Take mosquito repellent as they are pretty vigorous by the lakes. Go all the way to Catherine...it's totally worth it!! I will do this hike a couple of more times this summer for sure!!
44,2016-07-21,[''],"Didn't make it to the 4th lake, just up to Catherine and back down, but loved it! Had the lake all to myself and had a snack, and on the way down I saw a moose at the 2nd lake. Pretty hike! Nice escape from the 100 degree weather in the valley yesterday"
45,2016-07-10,['hiking'],Excellent hiking that offers a variety of terrains. All 4 lakes were gorgeous. Trails were not busy. And it was a loop! Wish more trails were loops. We loved this and will do it again.
46,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Beautiful scenery! From heavily wooded areas to boulder ""streams"" coming down the mountain and, of course, the lakes."
47,2016-06-26,['hiking'],Beautiful trail and beautiful lakes! my only complaint was the flies.
48,2016-06-25,['hiking'],"This was so beautiful. Once we got up the ski slope, which was a bit steep, it was a very easy hike."
49,2016-06-25,['hiking'],"Hiked from the Brighton parking lot to lakes Mary, Martha and Catherine...then over to Twin Lakes and down to Silver Lake. Absolutely beautiful. Still snow patches past Lake Mary. The best part was from Lake Mary to Twin Lakes. Awesome views and even saw two deer. By the time we got back to the car from Silver lake we had done 7 miles."
50,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"Lovely hike! Didn't do the loop, we just went straight up and first went left at the sign that tells you how far out each lake is to check out Dog Lake, then turned around and headed over to Lake Mary. We intended to go further to see Lake Catherine but we had to be back down by a certain time so we turned around. We went about 4 miles round trip. I loved seeing Lake Mary and just sitting on the rocks and hanging out, though. I'd love to go back and see Lake Catherine and also go over to Twin Lakes as well!"
51,2016-06-20,['hiking'],"This trail is one of my favorites. It can be a lot of uphill all at once, but it's worth it. There was still large patches of snow on the trail between Lake Martha and Catherine in the middle of June."
52,2015-09-25,['hiking'],"All uphill on the way there. Absolutely beautiful scenery. Although the lake as of today, (9/25/15) is more then half empty. We walked along parts of the lake which used to be the bottom. Not sure why."
53,2015-08-19,['hiking'],"This was a great trail for a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Getting to the trailhead is easy and there is plenty of parking since you start at the base of the Brighton Ski Resort.  
The start of the trail is wide and well maintained.  You get a great view of the main ski area with open fields and empty chairlifts.  Once you get past Dog lake the hike becomes more difficult, but still easy enough for people of all ages.
I encountered a pack of 4 moose at Mary Lake, 2 bulls, 1 cow, and a calf.  I spent a little time watching from across the lake and decided to move on after a crowd of people started to gather.  
Over each bluff I found a more amazing sites with a mixture of trees, fields of wild flowers, rock formations, and Catherine Lake.  If you take the time to hike to the top of the ridge you get an amazing view of all three lakes and the ski resort.  You can even continue your hike over the ridge line to the Albion Basin, or hike to the top of Sunset Peak for an amazing view of summit County.  "
54,2015-08-02,['hiking'],A little steep until you get to Twin Lakes. After that it's fine. Saw a deer and her two babies.
55,2015-07-30,['hiking'],"A bit steep to begin with as you climb and cross the ski runs, but the lakes are beautiful, the wildflowers are everywhere, and we saw two moose."
56,2015-07-18,['hiking'],Good hike! Beautiful views in the summer.
57,2015-07-06,['hiking'],"Easy hike to Lake Mary, Martha, and Catherine. Beautiful lakes but definitely bring some bug spray if you're hiking in the evening. The mosquitos are everywhere once you get to Lake Catherine. Easy hike for anyone, saw many little kids on the trail. People were cliff diving at Lake Mary. Fun place to spend the day."
58,2015-06-27,['hiking'],"Pretty steep, but doable with small kids."
59,2015-06-20,['hiking'],"Loved it. I went up to Catherine. There were still a few patches of snow, but easily passable. Great views."
60,2015-06-14,[''],"Beautiful trail with a stunning lake and views. The earlier you go the less busy it is. We went all the way up to lake Catherine, through quite a bit of snow in mid June. Worth the hike!"
61,2014-09-01,['hiking'],"Good hike, beautiful lakes. Pretty busy trail."
62,2014-08-16,['hiking'],"Beautiful, easy trail. Lots of shade and wildflowers."
63,2014-08-09,['hiking'],"I've never taken a hike that made me so angry.  Absolutely stunning scenery and good average hike. The predicament is that it's almost too beautiful.  Very busy trail but most notable - it's WATERSHED.  It's not for swimming and don't bring your pets.  I know and agree those lakes look amazing to swim in, but they look amazing because people aren't supposed to swim in them!  I can't believe my outrage on this trail. I grew up in salt lake and value the organization amongst our canyons. This canyon, and these lakes, were set aside for drinking water, not recreation.  It's a stunning, beautiful hike, but the selfishness of some hires disappoints me too much. I love every sweet dog I've ever had in my life, I get giddy when I see dogs on the trail, however, this is one place they need to be left home.  

As for the hike, completed in 2-2.5 hours.  Made amazing time on the ascent.  Notably less people at Lake Catherine, agreeable Lake Mary is the loveliest but the solitude always trumps."
64,2014-02-18,['hiking'],Saw a bull moose up at Lake Catherine. Lovely summer walk.
65,2013-08-22,['hiking'],Hiked this trail with a youth group and lost the trail between twin Lake and Lake Mary. boulder hopped until we found the trail. Make sure you stay on the trail. Some reviewers have the wrong trail there share a portion of this trail between Brighton lodge and Lake Marry.
66,2013-08-15,['hiking'],"I am in love with the mountain lake hikes up here in Utah.  They amaze me.  After living in Arizona for the past 9 years it baffles me at the beauty and serenity that comes from coming across these lakes.  This one is awesome.  Not super difficult.  The first part is the hardest.  Lots of people, until you pass Lake Mary.  I walked around Lake Mary and Lake Catherin and then trekked up to Sunset peak.  I saw 2 deer and a moose.  What a great way to spend the day.  Will be doing this hike again in a couple of weeks when I have family in town."
67,2013-08-09,['hiking'],"Short and easy loop from Brighton to three lakes: Mary, Martha, and Catherine. My favorite was the boulder strewn Lake Mary. Ran into a bull moose on the trail here so be aware!"
68,2013-07-29,['hiking'],"This was a wonderful loop trail with many towering views over Brighton ski resort trail meadows, pine/aspen forest, reflective lakes, rock formations and peaks. Many fluttering insects in the flower filled meadows. The hike itself was easy with a couple moderate increases in elevation. Overall a pleasant stroll, though my wife was a little more affected physically but definitely worth every step. All of the trail during this loop is well worn and easy to follow.

Our trail was a loop that began at Silver Lake, then to Twin Lakes, Lake Mary, Lake Martha, Dog Lake then back to Silver. A trail map (track) of the loop can be found here...
http://alltrails.com/tracks/silver-lake-lake-mary-and-brighton-lakes-loop"
69,2013-06-18,['hiking'],Completed this hike this morning. It was beautiful weather and still patches of snow along the trail. We went up to Mount Tuscarora which is the peak over looking Lake Mary. Well worth the effort. The views were spectacular. The last half mile to the peak isn't well marked but keep going till you get to the top. You'll know when you're there! 
70,2013-06-08,['hiking'],Great views. Still snow in areas as of early June. Trails are not clearly marked so some exploration was needed to find the lakes. Lake areas are well used by hikers so expect some company. We were unfortunate enough to have very loud (screaming/yelling) hikers in front of us. Just a side note to new hikers- use your indoor voice.
71,2012-10-07,['hiking'],"One of the year's best hikes for me.  The map of this trail doesn't fully detail all that's available.  We started at the Silver Lake Education Center going NE around Silver Lake, then W up to the dam at Twin Lakes Reservoir.  This was the steepest part of the hike, gaining 730 ft in 1.25 miles.  The altitude at the dam was about 9700 ft.  From the dam we went W to Lake Mary - about 1.5 miles.  This was the coldest part of the hike as it is on the north face in a piney forest.  Be careful to pick up the trail W of the dam as it forks left and is not marked.  If you go right there is a steep ascent up to the ski lift.  There is another dam at Lake Mary with a small lake and beach on the SE side.  We continued SW near Dog Lake, which is about where the best scenery ended.  From there we took the Dog Lake trail east, parallel to another ski lift and stream To the Brighton Resort where the other trail head was.  To get back to the starting point (Silver Lake Education Center) just walk through the giant parking lot along the NE portion of Brighton Loop (not far).  Do yourself a favor and buy a laminated trail map at the SLEC for $3.  The hike is gorgeous even though we missed the best of the fall foliage by 7-10 days."
72,2012-10-06,['hiking'],"Went to walk around Brighton & saw the lake so walked halfway & saaw more trails up, well we decided to walk up the trail to the Dam & it was the most beautiful walk I have taken ever!!!! Saw a little creature that we had no idea what it was until my husband showed the picture to a co-worker & found out it was a Pika. Such a cute little thing until it started coming down the rocks at me, freaked me out a little bit, but it was all fun.. And when we came back down he was still there, he must have lived there because he ran into a hole in the rocks & came out looking at us with a leaf in it's mouth, soooo cute!!!"
73,2012-09-19,['hiking'],Reasonably moderate hike with very beautiful scenic lakes. Sort of mini versions of sites from Glacier National Park.
74,2012-08-16,['hiking'],"Fairly short and moderate hike with my wife Lisa and 16-year-old son Eric.  Beautiful scenery; saw ferrets, pikas, badgers, and deer.  Guess I should have looked at the map beforehand, but I was surprised to find Lake Catherine near the end of the hike.  Eric and I backpacked down into Lake Catherine via Catherine Pass just a couple of weeks ago, so we effectively connected the two canyons (Big and Little Cottonwoods) on foot.  Highly recommend this hike."
75,2012-08-05,['hiking'],Great for the whole family.  Wish there were more places like lake Mary that you could actually swim in though.  But very nice hike non the less.  
76,2012-07-22,['hiking'],"We went early in the morning and enjoyed a great hike.  The weather was overcast so it wasn't too hot at all.  The trail begins at the Brighton Ski Resort at a clearly-defined trailhead.  The hike was a bit steep at first, but very doable by just about everyone.  Once you reach the top the views are beautiful.  This hike was well worth it."
77,2012-07-01,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful trail! The lakes around this area are astoundingly breathtaking. The trail is very clearly defined and well maintained. 
78,2012-04-22,['hiking'],I went there twice. First time with lots of snow and then in the summer. Both time it was amazing.
79,2011-08-28,['hiking'],Fantastic views. Tons of wildflowers at Lake Catherine.
80,2010-05-16,['hiking'],"A nice summer and fall hike. Plenty of wildlife and wild flowers. In the fall with an early snow and fall colors the place can't be beat for photos. It's steep in a few places, especially towards the top but tolerable. "
