0,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"Great little hike! Did this on a Sunday, and holy SMOKES were there a lot of people there to paddleboard/kayak in the reservoir. Be prepared to have to park pretty far from the trailhead if you get there after 10am."
1,2019-07-19,['backpacking'],Parking was really crowded. Short but beautiful trail that follows Causey Reservoir. Spent the night where the trail meets a small creek that feeds into the reservoir. gorgeous night. Kinda crowded but not too bad.
2,2019-07-11,['hiking'],This was a great little hike and dog friendly. Little steep in the beginning but overall not bad. Pretty views from the top and a lot of access to the water at the bottom. Good little jaunt. 
3,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"Beautiful views! I was pleasantly surprised with this hike. It starts off and ends a little steep, but overall it was pretty flat. There wasn’t a lot of shade, which was the only downside. It is totally worth hiking though!"
4,2019-06-26,['backpacking'],"We just did an overnight with 6 boys 12 and under along with 4 adults (25 June) and it turned out great.  The weather was slightly overcast and got down to upper 50s.  We slept at the end of the hike where the stream comes in.  We stayed in tents and hammocks and are Mountain House dinners.  My brother in-law caught 3 small rainbows at the campsite and another 8 near the trailhead.  We had small kids, but did the hike in about 1 hr 20 min.  Pretty views and water was brisk for a swim."
5,2019-06-22,['hiking'],The views are beautiful of the res especially now when it is full.  Simple trail with no turnoffs and moderate elevation gains.

8,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Short and sweet! Enjoyable in the early morning. You really feel like you're far away from the rest of the world. Definitely a fav.
9,2019-06-16,['hiking'],"Love this trail in September to see the Kokanee salmon run. Pretty narrow walks, elevation changes and some rocks. Moderate.  Lots of cool pull off spots and great views of Causey.  "
10,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"It most definitely is not 60% shade, but I was super grateful for the spots that had shade. Maybe it’s moderate for someone else. For me, it was brutal. However, I also acknowledge just how out of shape I am. 

Having said all that, it was absolutely worth it. The views were jaw droppingly spectacular. The photographer in me was super glad to go. "
11,2019-05-29,['hiking'],"I hiked this last year (2018) in June. This is one of my favorite trails. It has absolutely gorgeous views of the lake. It is fairly narrow, so a good portion of the time, you’ll be in a single file line if you’re going with others. There’s shade about 60% of the time, so make sure to bring a hat and some sunscreen. You won’t regret hiking this incredibly fun trail. "
12,2019-04-01,"['muddy', 'snow', 'washed out']","Would not recommend at this time. Trail is either muddy or has deeper soft snow on it. Not easy to grip even with tracks. My husband was slipping and nearly fell off this narrow trail. Wouldn't do this trail till it thaws. 

Trail is fantastic during summer and fall months. Did this trail last year during the early fall. Would recommend some hiking experience as it is narrow next to cliffs with some washout. Bring plenty of water and sunscreen."
13,2018-10-23,[''],Nice quick hike trail. I had my two dogs but the trail is pretty skinny at some parts so we kept moving out of people's way. Trail is moderately flat for the beginning then goes up a bit then down again. The climb back up isn't terrible and the bottom by the stream is beautiful. Was there a few weeks ago and there was still a solid amount of fish (most alive but some where dead as it's getting to the end of the season). Lots of people at the bottom but you can keep hiking down to find more solitude.
14,2018-10-07,['hiking'],"Good hike, nice views.  Lots of Fall colors.  Moderate hiker traffic and horseback travel."
15,2018-10-01,['hiking'],"Single wide trail. Definitely moderate. Hard work for young kids. 
We missed the Salmon by two weeks. Next year we will make it a priority to be here mid September. 
Beautiful colors and spectacular views."
16,2018-09-17,[''],Such a fun and amazing views. The Kokanee salmon were beautiful as well!!
17,2018-09-17,['hiking'],"Easy 5 miler that is much more crowded in Autumn. Hiking this one on a Sunday afternoon during peak season for the Kokanee Salmon spawn, we were coming across other hikers on the single track trail every 1-2 minutes, and you have to step aside since the trail isn't wide enough for two people. This appears to be a bike-able single track, but please don't bike it in the fall - there just isn't enough time for people to move out of the way, and bikers aren't able to get out of the way themselves. 

The trail is relatively easy. There is an incline at the beginning of both sides of the trail, with a higher section through open meadow at the top. If you hike a few times a year, you should be able to do it without any problems or any breaks. There were numerous children and older folks in poor health on the trail, so it should be accessible for anyone that can walk unassisted.

If you're here to see the Kokanee Salmon spawn, that is a yearly event during September. The times change. I've heard that it is typically in the second week of September. Of the three times I've been, I've seen single fish once, small groups of fish once (this time), and then the third time they were so thick that you couldn't help but step on them if you kayaked in. This visit seemed a bit late, as there were quit a few dead fish near where the stream emptied into the lake."
18,2018-09-17,[''],"I love this trail, gorgeous in the fall. It's becoming too popular tho it was a bit crowded comparing 2 years ago. My only complaint would be kids trying to grab and disturb the salmon while they are trying to mate, lay there eggs and being tired from their long swim... please do not allow dogs in the water or letting the kids to play with the salmon. It is illegal to catch them.  lets protect what's left."
19,2018-09-17,[''],Pretty busy (likely because of the Salmon). The fall colors are starting to appear too! We ended by cliff jumping into the reservoir; terrifying and amazing!!
20,2018-09-15,[''],"We loved this hike! We took our 4 kids ages 9, 6, 5 and 3. They were all able to complete the hike in and get back (although there was definitely grumbling and crying at times) except for the baby. We carried him the whole way. It was beautiful though! And the best part was seeing the Kokanee Salmon Run! We will definitely do this again next year."
21,2018-09-10,['hiking'],"Nice hike to see all kinds of nature! The salmon spawning in the stream was amazing to see. Mostly shaded, but narrow and steep most the way."
22,2018-09-09,['hiking'],it was steep on the way back up but not too bad overall I'd say rating is accurate. really crowded and a narrow trail so thats why I gave it 4 instead of 5. it's pretty though! the salmon were really cool to see! go early!
23,2018-08-26,['hiking'],Loved this trail! Beautiful views! Most of the trail is easy but there is no place to sit down along the way.
24,2018-08-11,[''],One of my favorites.
25,2018-07-20,['hiking'],"Great views and nature, not too crowded so that is always a bonus."
26,2018-07-09,['hiking'],Great trail and some awesome views. I would say the hike is right on with moderate and the creek at the end is ice cold so nice to put your feet in before you head back.
27,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"Awesome hike. It's a pretty narrow dirt trail the whole way, surrounded by green (in the summer at least).  You're up a slight steady incline, then it flattens out, then down back to the reservoir. Same going back. There's a section in the middle that opens up into a desert wildflower field. Overall, great hike!"
28,2018-07-02,['backpacking'],I spent the night here and had a good time. The river is beautiful and it would be cool to record with a drone. Lots of kayaks here. The parking is horrible on the weekend. The cops had a checkpoint at the entrance and were searching cars.
29,2018-06-23,['backpacking'],The trail is marked at the beginning but not anywhere else.  It’s not that big of a deal there only 2 split offs (just stay to the right).  It does get narrow at times but not bad and has good clearance above.  There are about 10 camp areas and they are all within ear shot of the creak and makes for a great night sleep.  We went on a Wednesday for an overnight trip and we were the only ones there.  Which was even better.   The lake was up to the camping area which makes it nice to bring your kayak in.  I took my 7/10 year old girls on their first backpacking/camping trip here.  They both had gear and had no problem with the trail. it took us about 2 hours to make it back with stops along the way to take pictures.  On the way back it only took 1:20.
30,2018-06-16,['hiking'],Nice hike.  I started early and had limited traffic but coming back ran into several groups.  The reservoir is kayak central.  About 30 kayaks when I left and hundreds when I came back.  If you go later in the morning or day parking will be a challenge.
31,2018-06-09,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery.  Only saw a few people on the trail.  Get to the trailhead early because the parking lot fills up with those looking to canoe.
32,2018-06-03,['fishing'],Easy beautiful hike around the reservoir.    Timed it the trip right after a rain strom and my dog and I were the only ones around. It was fantastic.
33,2018-05-30,[''],"I went yesterday (5/29/18) with my friend, her 3 kids (6,11,13) and our two dogs. Everyone had a great time. There was hardly anyone there. The scenery was absolutely stunning. This is now one of my favorite places to go."
34,2018-05-29,['backpacking'],"Great little trail if your looking for a getaway. We heard there were a few campsites at the Causey inlet,. There were so we stayed the night. Beautiful scenery, good up and down on the trail, but not too long if you want to take some younglings with with you. I wish I had brought a fishing rod. I have never seen so many fish jumping just before sunset."
35,2018-05-23,['hiking'],"Gorgeous trail, beautiful views and flowers right now"
36,2018-04-21,['horseback riding'],Great view of salmon run
37,2018-02-01,['camping'],Great spot for a weekend camping trip. The echoes of the water and wildlife really is calming. Def a great hike
38,2017-10-07,['hiking'],"This trail is 2.5 miles one way, 5 miles round trip, and overlooks the Causey Reservoir (near Huntsville, Utah) most of the way.

This trail is deceiving as far as difficulty level. When we started it, it seemed flat, especially the first half to 3/4 mile. Then it goes a little up and down and around a lot of bends in the reservoir. Along the way, we met other hikers who said they did not finish the trail. They turned around about .5 mile from the end because the trail appeared to go down a steep gradient. Our context of steep gradients is from Alta or other ski resort trails that pretty much go up at a 50% angle. We did make it to the end, the gradient on the way down was not as steep as we thought, and there were switch backs. Probably the steepest part was right at the end, descending from the end of the trail to the river's edge to see the salmon run. The way back seemed to pose a challenge too.... the way back made us realize the elevation gain was very gradual and more than we had expected or felt going into the trail. Though the trail appears flat along the way, there are a lot of rocky patches that can catch you off guard. Also we saw lots of horseshoe prints, but no horses! Overall it was a fun and challenging trail. Even more so this time of year when you get to see the salmon run! What a cool experience!  

As a side note, though the parking lot to the trail was crowded with cars and 3-4 horse trailers, not many people were actually on the trail. We saw lots of horseshoe prints, but no horses on the trail. Maybe all those people and horses were visiting ranch across from the trailhead?"
39,2017-09-24,['hiking'],It took us 3 hours and 15 minutes to hike with our 3 kids. We carried two of them but the 5 year old did great walking on her own. Great views and totally worth hiking in the fall to see the salmon run and the pretty fall colors. We will make this a yearly tradition I think.
40,2017-09-18,[''],This trail kicked my arse.  First hike since my knee surgery.  Loved and enjoyed every minute of it!!!
41,2017-07-17,['fishing'],"I hiked this trail today to do a little fishing at the River Inlet. I'm not in the greatest shape; I found the trail to be somewhat challenging and it took me about 1-1/2 hours to hump in. Once I arrived at the Inlet, I was a little disappointed at the amount of people/campers/kayakers in the area. But, that's what I get for going on a Sunday morning. The kayakers were congregating right in the casting areas. Also, there's a real lack of shoreline here; I was forced to do a little impromptu wet wading. The fishing was spectacular. The rainbows were hungry and aggressive. Caught 4 times my limit (not that that matters... C&R). If you're looking for a new place to fish Causey, I highly recommend fishing the inlet, if you can handle the hike."
42,2017-07-13,['hiking'],"Pretty easy trail with a steep climb heading back. The trail is pretty narrow and not super shady, but beautiful."
43,2017-07-04,['hiking'],Absolutely breath taking
44,2017-06-11,[''],Absolutely beautiful! We ended up turning back before completing the trail as my 10 year old son was feeling anxious over the dropoffs. I'll be heading back up sans children to complete.
45,2017-05-28,['hiking'],Great hike around Causey reservoir with great views. It was a holiday weekend so a bit busy on the trail but manageable. We took our dog and there were lots of other dogs. I'll do it again in the fall to watch the salmon spawn.
46,2017-05-27,['hiking'],It was a lot of fun and beautiful!
47,2017-05-22,[''],Great hike!
48,2017-01-03,['snowshoeing'],Super fun trail for snowshoeing! The snow was great and the views were awesome!
49,2016-10-15,['hiking'],It's a great trail to hike.  Did it with the family.  Just make sure your kids a surefooted when hiking because of some drop offs along the way.
50,2016-10-03,['hiking'],The hike alone was beautiful but seeing the kokanee in spawn really topped it off
51,2016-09-14,['hiking'],The best trails always have a gift at the end whether it's a gorgeous view or a chance to see the salmon swim up river.  It was amazing!
52,2016-07-29,['horseback riding'],"VERY GOOD HIKING TRAIL. Would NEVER again bring horses on it again though. The trail is a little narrow with a very steep drop off many feet down, into the lake below. I had a friend who's horse fell off the trail, into the water and drown. Very terrible and I would not want that to happen to anyone."
53,2016-06-18,['horseback riding'],"Horse Friends - Do not attempt to take trailer up without scouting in car first to know what trailer parking is like. There is no trailer parking.  Just parking on roadway.  On a typical Saturday that entire roadway is packed with parked cars so road is one lane only.  Turn around is tight and requires backing. Family's with kids, dogs, bikes, canoes, tents, etc at trailhead.

Moderate to hard trail with some hill climb, all single track, 30% of trail is rocky.

That said, the views are magnificent and a great place to take a swim with the horses after the ride!"
54,2016-05-22,[''],"great family hike, not too busy."
55,2016-05-19,['hiking'],"Nice, easy trail with beautiful scenery. Great for anyone. If you take kids on this trail just watch them as the trail is high above Causey Reservoir and it is a long way down on the North side of the trail. There are a couple of campsites at the end of the trail where the stream flows into the reservoir. I know some people backpack in or kayak to this point for camping."
56,2016-05-06,[''],I went last June. This is very beautiful and not much traffic once you get a ways in.
57,2016-04-29,[''],Nice easy trail
58,2015-09-20,['hiking'],"Skull Crack gives you beautiful views of Causey, especially the further in you go. My favorite time to hike here is during a light rain or winter when the lake is frozen and the trail is covered in snow. It's so beautiful. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's in and out. 

I've also canoed and paddle boarded on the reservoir. Lots of fun!"
59,2015-06-12,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail twice with my 10 and 6 year olds. The first time was just a normal hike, the second time we backpacked in to camp over night.  The first 2/3 of the trail is slightly up hill but not steep the last section is down hill but also not bad. There are 2 camping spots when you get to the end of the trail that are both pretty nice and if you cross the stream there are more but its mainly on rocks or uneven ground. We had a moose come through out camp site that scared us but it just went to the water to eat, we stayed far away from it cause I know they can be dangerous. At night the mice cone out so keep you food in a safe spot, we hung our stuff in a tree so bears and other things could not get to it. There are bathrooms at the beginning of the trail head so that was nice to have when you get back rpto your vehicle. Overall great trip."
60,2015-04-24,['hiking'],One of my all time favorite places to hike in my local hiking area. This area has more then just hiking as I will also bring my Kayak and follow the shoreline to the tributaries of this reservoir. This trail has lake views most of the hike and takes you from the shorelines to high above the lake. The trail is no to hard to hike and offers a nice work path that is easy to follow. If you hike to the end of this trail in the fall you will get to see the kokanee salmon make there way to spawning grounds. This is an amazing sight and worth the trip to see.
61,2015-04-15,['hiking'],"Easy trail with great views of the lake. Come in the fall to see the kokanee salmon - if you go during the right time, you could practically scoop them right out of the shallows. No fishing during that time, but they're a sight to see."
62,2013-05-27,['hiking'],Great trail. Lots of shade and low traffic.
63,2012-09-19,['hiking'],"I really enjoyed this trail.  It is in great shape and the traffic on it was mild.  I thought there would be a ton of people coming to see the Salmon Run.  A fairly level hike, not a lot of elevation on this hike.  The views of the lake and the rugged canyons are what make this hike unique to others I have been on this year.  Highly Recommened this hike around this time of year."
