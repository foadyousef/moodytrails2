0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],Loved this trail!  It's short but I went early and had the falls to myself and I just loved how the water cascaded over the rocks and it's definitely a unique waterfall worth seeing.  I agree that this is a friendly hike for all ages so long as little ones aren't climbing up the rock scramble at the end.
1,2019-09-07,['hiking'],Popular trail with lots of people. Great short and easy hike for kids and beginning hikers.
2,2019-09-05,['hiking'],"Very Easy hike, even if you have to park on the main road instead of the smaller lot by the bathrooms. Because of this it is always a really busy hike. Some think the waterfall is a let down, and even though it’s smaller I’ve never seen another like it. Great hike with even small kids."
3,2019-09-05,['hiking'],"You can either park by the highway or take the road all the way up to the trail, but the parking by the trail fills up quick! We liked the extra walk to the trailhead, even if it's all on a gradual incline. The trail itself starts out a bit steep, but eventually levels out. The trail is very pretty, mostly shaded, and you cross at least one stream before you end at the stream by the falls. There is a sign that warns to not climb the rocks of the waterfall, but there were a lot of people that ignored it despite the slippery rocks. Overall, very easy trail, nice views of forest and nearby mountains, and plenty of signage and obvious pathways to make sure you don't accidentally veer off course. The water of the stream was low enough by the waterfall that we could cross over and get closer without getting our shoes wet! The rocks are slippery though, so be careful, especially on the small climb down to the stream itself. "
4,2019-09-03,['hiking'],The trail itself was very easy and well shaded so you can go any time of the day and be fine. The parking lot fills really fast and if you have to park out on the street it could add about 1 mile total to the trail. When we got there the river was pretty full you can walk across it but you should bring some water shoes or your feet will get soaked!
5,2019-09-02,['hiking'],Too many people and the waterfall itself wasn’t much to speak of. Would recommend picking a different trail.
6,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"We started a little after 7am and it was not too crowded yet. Nice and cool the entire time and the sun was still not in the canyon. 

Nice short hike for nearly any skill level. 

If you want to see the waterfall going into the donut hole you have to climb down a little 5-10 foot rock face and then hike up the river/waterfall. You will need to step on stones and logs to not get your shoes wet. You also will have to climb up the waterfall that is pretty slippery and might not be for everyone. You can kinda see it from the bottom but not as good as the top. I took my sons 8 and 6 and went to the top. I had to help the 6 year old a few times with the climbing and river crossings. 

I’ll be back with more family members next time for sure. We loved it. "
7,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"It was okay! There was a lot of people though! To hike to the falls part, we all had to take turns climbing up there and seeing the waterfall up close. It was a quick easy hike though "
8,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Easy hike that is perfect for families or for something quick when there isn’t much time. Minimal incline for the first half the loop, then flat the rest of the way. Definitely recommend parking at Mill D rather than the trailhead lot to get a bit more distance. Plus, the views are awesome walking to the trailhead"
9,2019-09-01,['hiking'],Super fun trail. But way way crowded on a Sunday! In the summer wear hiking sandals. In the winter time wear crampons

11,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'scramble']","Great easy hike, worth especially if you are staying in SLC, only about 20 minutes from Sugar House.  Waterfalls are gorgeous!!!  "
12,2019-08-29,"['hiking', 'rocky']",1.0 mile each way out and back. Easy trail filled with pines. Saw a female moose. Kid friendly.
13,2019-08-28,['hiking'],Saw three big moose on the trail today!
14,2019-08-28,['hiking'],"Love this trail! It’s a short, super easy hike to the falls, which are beautiful. You can choose to hike up the rocks that make up the falls to see the actual “donut” which is highly suggest. It gets packed, but worth it. They give out parking tickets, so don’t park where you shouldn’t!"
15,2019-08-26,['hiking'],"Really cool waterfall, although very crowded once you get closer to the waterfall. A bit of a scramble to get to the top of the falls. Unfortunately there is a lot of trash on the trail, stop littering people!"
16,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Fun family hike. Easily accessible, so it's often very busy.
Sad to see so much graffiti along the trail right now. Many signs, benches, and trees have been defaced. Ugh. "

18,2019-08-23,"['hiking', 'private property', 'rocky']",This was a beautiful easy hike and nice waterfall! 
19,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"Donut Falls Trail was a pleasant hike! I was anticipating it being quite a bit longer (I doubt it was 3 miles), but wonder if it’s taking into account the distance from the further parking lot. We got there a little before 8am and there was plenty of parking by the trailhead but it filled up not long after. We were very cold. I think it would have been more enjoyable when the sun was over the mountains, but can see how high volumes of traffic would be a deterrent. The rocks leading up to the waterfall were very slick (as evidenced by the sign telling you not to go up them). I would not recommend doing it alone or bringing young children. We saw more than one person slip and fall into the freezing water. "
20,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"This is a very popular trail with a lot of families, so if you're looking for solitude, this isn't the hike for you. There are two parking areas, the larger being off the canyon road with a .50 mile walk on pavement to the trailhead and second parking area which is typically full. At the trailhead sign there are are two trails, the one to left is a more difficult terrain but they both lead to the falls. There is A LOT of traffic at the falls and to reach the top requires scaling slippery steep rock. Plan on getting wet feet if you want to get close to the falls. "
21,2019-08-23,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'off trail']",Nice family friendly trail. There is a lot of foot traffic however. Bring shoes that you don’t mind getting wet and muddy. You will have to climb up/down some rocks and walk through the water.

23,2019-08-20,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
24,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"Really easy hike with very rewarding views. My friends and I climbed to the top of the waterfall and went into the donut. I ran through the waterfall and it was so fun!! It took us about 2 hours, but we spent a lot of time at the waterfall. I will definitely do this one again. "
25,2019-08-17,['hiking'],Awesome hike today!! Lots of chipmunks on the trail!
26,2019-08-12,"['hiking', 'rocky']","really pretty hike, we went to the bottom and then the top! I didn't realize theres a rope to use to climb into the donut. not sure I would've anyway! :) pretty and good workout but not hard at all. easy hike! "
27,2019-08-12,['hiking'],This is a great family trail! The waterfall is awesome and our kids loved it! I would for sure take them back and do it again. You will get wet so have water shoes. 
28,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"This trail is great! It is beautiful the whole way there and ends in a beautiful waterfall. It is a little sad that many people that are on this trail don't respect the wildlife or the rules. When you arrive there is parking right at the trailhead after driving through a dirt road, but if the parking lot is full you can park by the main road. There is a bathroom at the beginning of the trail. There isn't any swimming or wading because it is a watershed, but sadly a lot of people don't follow this rule. When you are almost to the falls there is a point where the trail forks. The left trail goes to the bottom of the falls and the right goes up above past some private property signs and above the donut part of the waterfall. Our 9 and 7 year olds were fine the whole way up. Be careful! The rocks can be slippery."
29,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",If you are the type of person who likes solitude this is not hike for you. It was very crowded. We were lucky to be able to park near the parking lot and not out on the main road. Most of the hike is easy - our four-year-old twins did it without any problems. We made it to the base of the falls but the final scramble up the rocks was far too crowded and slippery to take young kids. So we are unable to see the donut part of Donut Falls. I would definitely recommend trying this hike early in the morning midweek but not during peak weekend hours. Also if you have little kids and want to go up to the donut you probably need an adult for each child. There are many other awesome hikes in the area that I would choose before this one.
30,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'rocky']","I had high hopes for this trail. I'm not a hiker, and quite out of shape... but this app rates trails like Silver Lake Loop easy... and this trail in the same 'easy' category. This trail is quite an inclined, rocks and roots cover much of the trail. This trail should be rated hard if for no other reason that to complete the hike, and get the picture pay off, you've got to climb straight up huge SLIPPERY boulders. "
31,2019-08-10,['hiking'],We drove up to the parking at the base of the hike so we didn’t have to hike the road. The trail was beautiful and we loved the falls. There is high traffic but not on the second side of the loop.
32,2019-08-10,['hiking'],So much fun! Didn’t realize there was parking near the trail head. Got a little muddy but worth it! 
33,2019-08-07,"['hiking', 'rocky']",8/7/19 Definitely an easy hike to get to the falls. But I would say to actually climb to the donut part you need to have an adult with a kid younger than 8. My boy who is 10 made it up super easy without help. Today however we went when it was a bit rainy. Water is freezing!  But the view was amazing. Definitely worth the numb feet! :) 
34,2019-08-07,['hiking'],"8/7/2019 You’re not going to believe this, but we had Donut Falls to ourselves!  We went this morning and got a great parking spot at the trailhead around 8:30am.  We saw hikers coming down, but during our actual time in the Donut cave  and climbing down the falls, we had the place entirely to ourselves—not a soul in sight until we were away from the falls.  Such a beautiful hike on an overcast morning.  My 11 year old son with autism made the climb to the donut hole and back down (which is really the tricky part) and is so proud of himself.  My 9 year old guy has done it 4 times now easy peasy.  Gotta know the trail and your kids’ abilities though.  Being inside the cave where the water comes through is a thrill, and the water is still super high this year.  Love this hike!"
35,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"Busy trail, but still a nice trail "
36,2019-08-04,['hiking'],Quick hike that’s mainly kid friendly. Need water shoes to get to the waterfall but a pretty hike even without the water shoes
37,2019-08-04,['hiking'],Very easy trail
38,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"Very beautiful hike. Trail is well maintained and signs to help with direction of the trail. We saw a deer while on the hike as well. At the waterfall we decided to hike up the rocks of the waterfall to get up to the actual donut fall. Would definitely not recommend that section for kids. Get there before 9am if you’d like to try and beat the crowd. We parked at the bottom near the main road, but there is a parking areas farther up that fills fast."
39,2019-08-03,['hiking'],"Really easy hike, good for kids, they loved climbing up the falls."
40,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
41,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'scramble']","Super short hike, but the kids loved treading through the water and scrabbling up the rocks to the falls. BE SURE TO BRING WATER SHOES! There is no way to get up to the falls without getting your feet wet. And honestly that’s the best part of the whole trail. "
42,2019-08-01,['hiking'],short and sweet! Took my 12 and 9 yr old no problems. Very pretty
43,2019-07-31,['hiking'],"Beautiful, completely kid- family friendly but maybe a little too much so.  Pretty large groups of families and camp groups making the hiking not as relaxing."
44,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"Very busy, but the short hike to the falls is quick and easy! "
45,2019-07-29,['hiking'],super trial...
46,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"Great trail, hikers with poor attitude and etiquete. I saw people littering and walking dogs when it explicitly says “no dogs allowed” definitely don’t recommend it if you like quiet, peaceful hikes. "
47,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"The hike was easy and not bad at all. I’m a little bummed because all the photos I saw online made it seem like it was this big waterfall and cave you could stand under but it’s pretty small. You do have to like rock climb a little and walk through the river to see the fall. I would do again, and it’s easy, just online was misleading a little bit. "
48,2019-07-29,['hiking'],great quick trail. Super busy but worth it. 
49,2019-07-29,['hiking'],Short easy hike with big rewards.
50,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"Definitely an easy, but rewarding hike! Your feet will get wet if you decide to hike to the top of the waterfall, but it was worth it!! Only gave it 4 stars because of the amount of other people on the trail, heavily trafficked."
51,2019-07-27,['hiking'],beautiful wildflowers and grasses. truly gorgeous hike. took 50 minutes from the first parking lot by the Hwy up past the waterfall. only thing I didn't live was the masses of somewhat unfriendly hikers....
52,2019-07-26,['hiking'],"Easy hike, well covered, with high payoff. Make sure you hike into the grotto where the falls enter the rock."
53,2019-07-25,['hiking'],A little bit harder than we anticipated for our grandparents hiking with us but a fun trail! Up at the top you have to hike across some slippery rocks and down a tricky part. Wear water shoes.
54,2019-07-23,['hiking'],More of a stroll than a hike I’d say but fun nonetheless! 
55,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail and easy for kids, I took ages 9,7,5 and carried the toddler in a pack. Highly recommended."
56,2019-07-22,['hiking'],Love this trail for snowshoeing. Take some micro spikes for a scramble to the falls- so cool to see when everything is frozen over! 
58,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"We definitely took the wrong way. Got a nice view of the falls from above, though. There isn’t a real end destination for the trail, the waterfall is just kind of there. We brought donuts but there was no room to sit and eat, though."
59,2019-07-20,['hiking'],It was pretty but waaay too crowded.
60,2019-07-18,['hiking'],Took my 4 year old and 2 year old. It was beautiful!
61,2019-07-18,[''],"A nice, easy hike meandering through a pine forest. The falls are picturesque but even on a Monday it’s quite crowded. "
62,2019-07-17,[''],Nice easy fun hike. Heavily trafficked. Good for kids. 
63,2019-07-15,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful
64,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"so very crowded,  too busy! beautiful and lots of shade.  "
65,2019-07-14,['hiking'],simple hike with kids but overloaded with people. Still a very beautiful hike.
66,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"The snow has melted and you can all the way to the donut. If you wear good shoes and be mindful of the water. It is moving fast and gets deep in some parts. Kids can go most of the way, but I would only take teenagers all the way to the donut. Love this hike! "
67,2019-07-08,['hiking'],Hiked this trail over the 4th of July weekend. It was super crowded. Surprised we found a parking at the trailhead.  Beautiful easy hike. To get to the actual donut falls you’ll have to scramble over & through big wet rocks at the end. Be prepared to get your feet wet. I kept my younger kids behind as the water flow was pretty heavy . It was nerve wrecking watching  the rest of our party climb up the rocks to the donut. 
69,2019-07-02,['hiking'],Nice easy hike for the kids.
70,2019-07-02,['hiking'],"did the trail June 29th 2019.
I have done the trail many times and on Saturday water was the highest I have ever seen.  good hike but be careful"
71,2019-07-01,['hiking'],Love this hike. But even though it's Monday afternoon it's still pretty busy and we ended up having to hike in from the highway cuz I've seen cars being ticketed in the past that have parked off the side of the road near the parking lot. The water is still pretty cold and I didn't feel like it was safe enough for my 11 and 9 year olds to hike to the top of the falls cuz the river is still moving pretty quick but it was still awesome and worth the hike 
72,2019-07-01,['hiking'],"The map says to start from the main highway for the 3 mile loop. We walked up a paved road for about .5 mile and realized you can just drive all the way up to the actual trail head by the bathroom and park for free. We didn’t mind the extra exercise as the trail to the falls is pretty easy but would have been nice to know. The falls were flowing high. The  main trail leads down to the river bed. You can hardly see the actual donut and to see it closer you’d have to scramble pretty much up the face of the waterfall. We found some side trails that led up the mountain a ways. The trail was small and strap but doable but even at the very top, we were still too far away to get a very good look at the donut. A fun hike with different difficulty levels depending on what your goal is for the day. We would come back probably later in the season when the water is lower to get a bit closer to the falls without being swept away. Overall a fun hike just up the canyons with beautiful scenery and quiet environment. "
73,2019-07-01,['hiking'],Hiked on 5-22. The main trail is pretty easy and scenic. Getting next to the Donut is a little tricky due to the heavy water flow. We climbed the side of the mountain to try to get to the donut (more difficult). There are several very steep descent paths we tried (be careful).  We found the right one and were able to get to the donut. The water was flowing too hard to go underneath the donut. 
74,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
75,2019-06-28,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes! The river levels were high so you couldn't easily get to right under the falls.
76,2019-06-27,['hiking'],"LOVE this trail!! I have done this hike twice in the last 2 weeks with my baby in my pack. It is easy enough for the whole family to enjoy. There is a tiny scramble over some rocks in order to get to the falls, but it's fairly easy."
77,2019-06-25,['hiking'],"Falls is raging! Read some reviews before going so I was prepared with my water shoes and it’s a good thing I did! Was able to climb up and get in the cave but water was above my knees and freezing, but very worth getting in. Love this hike!"
78,2019-06-25,['hiking'],"Just did this today, it’s one of my favorite spots to hike to. You’ve gotta get your feet in the river if you want to climb up to the donut cave, and the water is super cold but it’s totally worth it. The water is moving pretty quick, but it’s doable if you watch your step. Saw some patches of snow up past the cave, but not much at all, should be gone within the next week or two. "
79,2019-06-23,['hiking'],"Good hike! The trail gets rather treacherous high up - muddy, snow patches, steep and rocky. I took the shady route up but on the way down I stayed along the creek instead of crossing back over the little bridge, it was nice! The falls are flowing really strong still so there's no getting as close to the ""donut"" as you usually would be able to this time of year."
80,2019-06-21,"['hiking', 'muddy']",This trail is a great and easy! Perfect for a simple day hike. The water is running pretty high so you can’t quite make it to the sign but still a pretty view of the river and falls. We even saw a moose on our last time up! 
81,2019-06-19,[''],"some snow and muddy spots. wet feet and so much fun. cool temperatures and great views. water moving fast, so be smart.
took my 3 and 5 year old grandsons. they hiked it all the way and back. 
exceptional family hike. "
82,2019-06-18,[''],"Currently the trail has some muddy spots but passable.  

Easy 2 mile round trip hike to the falls (from bathrooms at the dirt trailhead).  4 miles round trip from the major road if you walk all the way in.  Great place for photos.  Not good for people who may have a hard time climbing or steep hills.  "
83,2019-06-15,['hiking'],"First hike with my 6 & 8 year old and we loved it! Pretty easy hike with a great payoff at the end. There's a pretty steep part right before the falls, but it's not too bad. It was early June and the water was running fast so we couldn't get all the way up. We'll be back later in the year when the water isn't running as fast."
84,2019-06-15,['hiking'],Fun little hike. It is still a little muddy and slick. Crazy busy!!!! 
85,2019-06-15,['hiking'],Easy hike lots of traffic 
86,2019-06-13,[''],"great, pretty, shady "
87,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'rocky']","This is a great hike and totally worth the waterfall!! I would rate this trail moderate, though, because there are some pretty technical spots."
88,2019-06-12,[''],"a bit slippery, but the perfect hike to start the season. "
89,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
90,2019-06-10,['hiking'],"Short trail, lots of people & the waterfall at the end that you can climb"
91,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']","6/7/19–3:32pm: I’ve attempted this hike twice and just can’t seem to  make it to the falls! Today, the weather was beautiful. Temperature was moderate and there was a small breeze, perfect for this hike. The trail was muddy almost from the start and there was quite a bit of snow up the entire trail. Saw a small garden snake at the trail head. The first bridge is covered by small fallen trees and water so we had to walk around on the snow. When we finally got to the fork that goes down to the river, we discovered that the water was WAY to high to take that path. It’s flowing really fast right now and the lower trail next to the River is completely covered. We tried the alternative route above and we decided that there was too much snow to trek through. We ended up turning around, and decided to try again a bit later in the season! Always a good hike though. Beautiful sights to see!"
92,2019-06-06,[''],one of my favorite hikes. its suoer pretty in the winter.
93,2019-06-04,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']","Great easy hike, very muddy. "
94,2019-06-03,[''],"Super easy hike that can be done in an hour with kids.  Getting to the falls requires climbing on some rocks toward the end, but it's an easy climb.  If you're an experienced hiker looking for a challenge you'll be disappointed.  if you're a very casual hiker looking for a quick morning or afternoon trip you'll have a great time.  "
95,2019-06-02,"['muddy', 'snow']",Hiked this so many times I could probs do it blindfolded. The river is roaring this time of year so be careful!!
96,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Great trail leading to a waterfall. It's muddy and there is quite a bit of snow still out. Wear shoes with good grip or you'll be sliding all over the place. You have to climb some rocks and get into the water to get to the donut hole.

I thought I’d be cold and wasn’t at all"
100,2019-06-01,"['muddy', 'snow']",Prepare to get your feet wet and muddy. Beautiful hike. 
101,2019-06-01,"['muddy', 'snow']","We did this trail yesterday. It's easy to find, and marked well. My four year old made it to the point where you can see the falls but getting right up to them is a bit too tricky for the young ones. Bring extra socks and shoes for when you get done if you plan on getting very close. It's beautiful though, and worth the wet feet!"
102,2019-05-31,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Friday 5/31/19 1.30-3pm 60's & sunny. First 0.75 miles is up road (paved then dirt) thru a few private residences. Then left branch of trail goes thru mud, packed snow, and stream. At the end you are walking in stream to base of falls with snow all around.  gorgeous. lots of people of all ages, footwear (flip-flops!), and clothing (swimsuits!).  Great bang for the buck. After doing Grandeur Peak in the AM this was a good ending for the day.  "
103,2019-05-31,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",A good bit of snow still on the path but it's pretty packed down so walking on it wasn't hard. Wear ok shoes and you should be fine. Beautiful hike with an awesome ending. 
104,2019-05-26,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Trail is in decent condition. Expect slick spots, slushy areas and depending on shoes the potential for wet feet. We made it all the way to the donut hole.  "
105,2019-05-26,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']",This is an absolutely beautiful trail. There is lots of snow still the farther in you get so be prepared. Poles aren’t necessary unless you want to climb up the waterfall. Climbing up the waterfall is a little dangerous at times and slippery. Poles would be useful but it can be done without. Beautiful at the top!

You can, but I tried with hiking boots and poles and kept falling. The snow is melting and hollow and slippery, so you don't know when you'll slip or fall through."

There were a few slippery parts but for the most part, it was easy to follow the tracks on the snow to the waterfall. You can see a tiny bit of the waterfall through the snow but if you're looking for a great waterfall experience, I'd wait till more snow has melted."
126,2019-04-25,"['hiking', 'snow']",Great trail! I hiked this trail end of April and there was still a lot of snow. I don’t recommend this trail to kids. It’s not exactly an easy trail as the whole trail (aside from the mile hike to the trail head) was on snow. When we got to the falls it was a slippery hike up and we pretty much slid down on our bottoms to go back down. All and all it was a very fun hike in the snow.
127,2019-04-24,['hiking'],Easy hike. Even in the snow. Since it’s so popular it’s pretty packed down and easy to follow. Still suggest boots over sneakers when there’s snow.

(Learn from my mistakes) Great shorter ish hike!

The snow right now is packed pretty well, but slick in some places so if you don't want to bring snowshoes wear shoes with good tread. There are little to no directions once you are on the trail, it's easy to get lost and I met 3 groups who gave up. Once you reach the trail head, head right towards and past the bathrooms. If you are hiking in the snow, the trail forks after going uphill for a while, STAY LEFT! After a short jaunt later it looks like it forks again, STAY LEFT. You're almost there at this point! You'll go down a small steep hill into the ravine. Stay to the right. The falls are in front of you after a few feet, you just can't see them, they are covered in snow. You have to climb up a super steep hill covered in snow. In the summer time, this hill is the rocky stream leading up to the falls, but in winter, just a snowy climb. The cave entrance is at the top.

Some people were wearing tennis shoes.  We wore our snow pants, hoodies and snow boots.  I am glad I wore waterproof boots because when you get to the top and go in the falls you can walk through the shallow water under the falls.  The hike is easy and beautiful.  In the summer you will have to climb up some rocks to go into the falls.  I recommend going in both the summer and the winter."

144,2019-03-10,['hiking'],Fairly easy trail. Beautiful scenery. The only thing that sucks is you can not bring dogs on trail. You can be fined. The actual falls are pretty as well. I would suggest hiking to the very top to see the donut hole.

151,2019-01-31,[''],1-30-19. I made it up to the falls. It was a bit slippery at the top if you dont have the correct shoes. You need to park by the road making it a 3 mile round trip.

We had on spikes/ Crampons and made it to the cave fine.  Headed up a little before 9, and there was not too many crowds, but as we headed down there was a huge group heading up.  Most people heading up had sleds.  I wish I would have asked them where they were heading to sled.  I am thinking they were going to take the V shaped trail marked on my blog to the North Fork road and then sled down it.  Definitely would have been fun sled ride down."

157,2019-01-06,['hiking'],I hiked this yesterday with a friend. It wasn’t too crowded and the snow was packed down so hiking boots were fine. We didn’t do the very last part to the actual falls because it was too steep and slippery. Other people were doing it though.
158,2019-01-02,[''],Amazing short little hike. It has hard snow pack so no snow shoes necessary. The view at the falls is amazing. Truly a great one for the whole family. And the reward is well worth the work.
159,2018-12-28,['hiking'],"Lovely winter hike. The road and trail were sufficiently packed that snowshoes were not necessary, although they may help some folks. No waterfall visible during the winter, but it was still worth it for a beautiful woodland walk."
160,2018-12-22,[''],"If you’re looking for an easy paved and cut out trail this is for you. You’ll be directed to the waterfall with ease. Now, if you want to go to see the donut shaped rock where the waterfall has cut through, you’ll need to do some climbing. My group scaled the waterfall. Shoes and pants were wet, but to us, it was worth it to feel the icy water and take pictures at the top. We typically do difficult hikes, so adding this climbing factor make it more interesting and worthwhile."

I had hike spikes and poles and that worked great. The falls at the end was amazing and so worth traversing up the rocks at the top to get inside the little cave. The road to the trailhead is closed due to snow but it doesn’t make it that much longer.

166,2018-11-09,['walking'],"A nice gentle slope and walk through the woods until the last 150m.

You have to walk across the stream, skipping over stones and logs. The last 35m is a scrambling rock climb, pretty treacherous, so unless you have good climbing skills and suitable footwear, don’t even try it. If it’s been freezing it’s a no-go as the rocks are quite smooth and impossible to scale. Nice cave with waterfall at the top following the climb."

This hike is super easy even in the snow. Had a blast and the little falls that’s at the end was worth the little hike there."
183,2018-09-17,[''],"Easy trail, somewhat protected with a gentle ascent, barely noticeable once you are on the trail. Only tricky part is getting down to the creek just before you get to the falls. Rocks are a little slick and you just need to be careful. Crossing the creek is easiest if you just get your shoes a bit wet.  Gala are gorgeous and be really careful if you decide to head up to the falls."
184,2018-09-15,[''],very fun the donut was a hike to get to though.
185,2018-09-11,[''],"Hiking on a weekday when it’s less busy? Want to shave 1.6 miles off the stated 3.0 mileage? Save yourself the aggravation and drive the 0.8 miles down the road to the ACTUAL trailhead. I really wish people used these reviews to provide useful information as was intended for this forum. The app incorrectly states that the trailhead is off the side of the highway but if you drive down the paved road for 0.8 miles you will see the actual trailhead. I was really irritated to add mileage walking down a private road which doubled the actual mileage of the hike — especially on a Monday when it wasn’t busy and there were spots at the trailhead. The trailhead isnt large so I imagine on weekends it would fill up quickly. I’d say maybe 20 cars can fit, maybe less. Wish I knew this before hand. Also once you make it to the waterfall if you want to see the actual donut hole that people photograph you have to hike up the waterfall over slick rocks. While this did not pose a problem for me, a lot of the reviews claim the elderly can do this hike and I’d like to clarify that it is true to a point given the climb up the waterfall itself. If you’re reading this please pass it forward and write useful information on these reviews so it helps everyone seeking information. Should be common sense. Don’t be a sheeple."
186,2018-09-11,['hiking'],"From Missouri reviewer: this trail was very easy. There’s a bit of an incline at the beginning but otherwise it was a great trail for all ages. The waterfall was beautiful but very rocky so be careful! We climbed up and over the waterfall to have lunch and it was lovely. Highly recommend for a quick hike for people not from Utah, and who aren’t use to the altitude but still wanna get outside. 
Views: 5 stars
Trail difficulty: easy
Access to trailhead: easy drive up road."
187,2018-09-11,['hiking'],always love hiking this trail. sometimes you'll see animals sometimes not. but a great trail none the less.
188,2018-09-10,['hiking'],Very nice trail. Hiked it yesterday morning. Saw a mule deer and young moose. To see the donut part of the falls you need to scale to the top of the falls.
189,2018-09-08,['hiking'],"Moderate hike, nice trails that are marked. Trail head was behind the bathroom building, we walked back from the falls on the dirt road next to the stream that connects back to the main road out. Waterfall is not running very fast but was still worth seeing. Able to get across the stream on rocks so didn’t get shoes wet, if water was higher you would want water shoes. Don’t forget a jacket if you go in the morning it can be 30 degrees colder in the mountains."
190,2018-09-08,['nature trips'],Great hike! Easy enough for the young and old. The trail is well worn and plenty wide. Very high foot traffic so you won't get lost. The waterfall is fantastic. One of my favorites to visit.

196,2018-09-02,['hiking'],"We had our family campout at Spruces campground. there is a trail head right at the end of Spruces Campground that takes you all the way to the beginning of the trailhead to Donut Falls. With that being said, if you're going from Spruces up to Donut Falls it's 2.4 miles each way. We did take a nine year old and eight year old and 4 year old. After a little while the four-year-old was extremely tired and we had to carry her some of the way. The trail is pretty easy and not strenuous at all until you get to the falls.  Each person has to help each other get down huge rocks and then climb huge rocks to get to the falls. if your going to go, take hiking sticks. They worked amazing and helped brace me going down the rocks and coming down the rocks. I would recommend wearing water shoes or at least bring water shoes. When you get to the very top there is a cave with water that goes maybe to your ankles. People were playing in it and having a blast. We did eat some snacks when we got to the too. Plenty of rocks to sit and enjoy!"
197,2018-08-31,[''],"The hike itself was actually ok. Most of the trail felt like a dirt road for cars. However, the end result was incredible. The falls and the cave were spectacular."
198,2018-08-29,['hiking'],Nice short hike but I am thinking no way is it 3 miles round trip.  Maybe more like 1.5 or 2 max.  Great for very small children.
199,2018-08-28,['hiking'],"Beautiful water fall if you can scramble all the way up the creek over the boulders and get into the actual cave where the waterfall is at. Standing next to the falls coming through the ceiling of the cave is a great family memory. Younger family was able to accomplish it with some tugging and lifting here and there as you have to scramble uphill over a rocky/boulder filled creek bed. Definitely got feet/legs wet. I would rate this 5-stars for the falls alone, BUT we went on a summer holiday weekend and it was extremely crowded with very poor parking for how busy it was, and bathrooms were horribly dirty and out of paper. Great waterfall to hike to, but definitely avoid peak times (weekends, holidays)."
200,2018-08-27,[''],I'm really out of shape and overweight with that being said I was still able to complete this hike. It was a beautiful senic hike. For me semi steep in the very beginning and lightens up from there. Took me and hour in total to get there and back down. Definitely will do it again.
201,2018-08-26,[''],"way to crowded.  they need to update the parking, bathrooms and hiking area.  it's  inadequate for the amount of traffic in the area."

We got there at 6 AM, so we got on the trail before anyone else, but on the way down it was like a conga line going up to the falls. The trail was beautiful and the falls were pretty. We didn’t let the kids do the scramble up to the top off the falls although I did and enjoyed that little challenge at the end of the trail. The rest of the trail was great for both of my kids."
206,2018-08-17,[''],"Really crowded which makes sense because it's not too strenuous or long so kids can come.

very very muddy right now. We didn't want to slip so we didn't climb down the rock to see the falls. Really pretty hike and worth it for sure."

210,2018-08-14,[''],"Short and easy hike. The only tough part was climbing the rocks to get a better view of the falls at the top. Saw a moose (!!!!) and tons of chipmunks along the way. I went on a Sunday around 11am and it was pretty crowded, but there were still plenty of parking spots on big cottonwood canyon road. From there I walked the .75ish miles on the paved road (FR019) to the trailhead."
211,2018-08-13,[''],We started our hike at 8:15 this morning and didn't see many people. Tip: you can park at the trailhead though this app directs you to park along the Big Cottonwood Canyon road. If you go early there will be spaces  otherwise walk a mile to the trailhead. Bold ground squirrels were entertaining.
212,2018-08-12,[''],great all around hike not to difficult unless you want to climb up to get a closer look at the falls.
213,2018-08-12,['hiking'],"Fun & easy hike. We parked near the main road & had to walk in on the paved road, but it was still fairly easy. You can try driving all the way to the trailhead to see if you can get a parking spot - be careful not to park in a marked spot that says no parking at any time or you’ll be ticketed (even on Sundays) 
My two year old hiked all the way in with the exception of a couple rocky spots. Come willing to get a little wet & you’ll have a good time. 
We hiked up to the top where you can see the actual “donut fall”. Brings lots of water & maybe even some snacks."
214,2018-08-10,[''],Great trail for kids. The last little way up to the actual falls is a bit of a scramble but a fun challenge for the kids. We even ran into a few moose on the trails.
215,2018-08-09,['hiking'],I love this hike. Be prepared to wait in certain areas because it’s always busy and with lots of little children. It’s great to see their happy faces but it can be dangerous. Always keep an eye on your children.
216,2018-08-06,['hiking'],"Thanks our first nature hike in Utah. It was great for the kids. Some river crossings and pretty forest to walk through. The last part after the bridge was a little tough for our 3 year old (some boulders to climb up and down), so we skipped the actual falls and just played in the water by the bridge."

It was gorgeous and the kids all did it easy-peasy!  Scrambling up the rocks to the waterfall and stepping into the cave where the water falls through the “donut” hole has to be one of my favorite hiking moments.  That’s why we have to do this one at least once a year.  As we were hiking down, HOARDS of people were hiking up.  Families, school groups, foreigners...everybody’s up for this flavor of donut."
222,2018-08-02,[''],First hike and really enjoyed it!  Some inclines and declines!  Good for beginners and small children.
223,2018-08-01,['hiking'],"We took my 2 year old, she was able to complete the whole trail herself. Very pretty, with lots of shade. We started the trail around 9:00am. It was very crowded on the way back, about 10:30am."
224,2018-08-01,['hiking'],"Great family friendly hike. If your willing to get your feet wet and climb some rocks to see the waterfall then it is totally worth it.  My wife, myself, and my son (1) had a blast visiting this hike."

227,2018-07-29,[''],Pretty but too many people for me. Awesome falls but more of a family hike. Plenty of water at the end but still bring some.
228,2018-07-29,['hiking'],"If the road is closed you need to plan on an additional mile hike to get to the trailhead (2 additional miles total). Making it a much longer hike for littles. It is fairly easy with a small incline that flattens out regularly. Shade and sun throughout the trail making plenty of spots to rest. We went on a holiday and it was crazy busy. 
The falls themselves are small and leave much to be desired. The hike is beautiful so if you’re going for the journey it will be fine but if you’re wanting to see some waterfalls you might be disappointed. 
Glad we went but don’t know if we’d repeat it."
229,2018-07-29,[''],"Good kid friendly hike, except there is a climb to the bottom of the falls."
230,2018-07-28,[''],"nice hike and nice wayerfall.  alot of people on the falls.  after looking at the falls and walking through the river I hiked up a trail that I previously passed that took me up above the falls.  I think I was way past them, but was able to get down to the river.   started to walk downstream, but the water was pretty cold.  I instead went and found a geocache back up the hill.  It was a pretty good time, but like I said....it was popular."
231,2018-07-27,['hiking'],"-Very crowded on a Friday afternoon
-Limited parking
-Very short hike (40min) 
-Water fall was not that great
-Probably good for younger kids"
232,2018-07-27,[''],
233,2018-07-26,[''],This was not an easy hike! My kids 12 and 9 did great. My parents 70’s could not do this hike. Up hill with dusty rocky trail. We were worried about older people knees and ankles! Beware: to see the falls you have to go down a bolder maybe 7-8 feet down. Definitely not something for the older inexperienced.
234,2018-07-26,[''],So fun to explore this during the winter. You certainly need good shoes because there is still snow there. We made it to the top and it was really cool to go in the cave!
235,2018-07-25,['hiking'],"After reading reviews here, we got there at 8 am.  Found a parking spot and off we went.  Was not busy at that time.  We saw more people on the way back down.  At falls it was us and 2 other small groups.  Cool nice weather."
236,2018-07-25,['hiking'],"This isn’t too much of a hike.. it’s always busy and so many people get injured trying to climb the rocks and up to the falls. Every time I have hiked this to give it another chance, I find myself irritated, so it’s not really worth my time to go again."
237,2018-07-25,[''],great family friendly trail. last bit to the falls is very difficult.
238,2018-07-24,['hiking'],We went on a Monday in July and it was a madhouse. Too many people for my taste and had to park about a mile away because there was nowhere to park. Expect a ton of kids. The hike itself was nice and easy and I love hiking near water but the crowds and lack of trail etiquette ruined it for me.
239,2018-07-22,[''],"it won't work up a sweat, but it's a nice leisurely trail with a nice waterfall at the end."
240,2018-07-22,[''],"A fun, quick hike that leaves you feeling refreshed. The ending is steep and dangerous for little ones and those who are weary of climbs, but I loved it. The trail at the end goes into the river so plan on getting your shoes wet. The waterfall in the hole itself is super cool as well. Highly travelled so if you don't like a lot of people, then this trail may not be your fav."
241,2018-07-19,[''],Loved this family friendly hike!!!
242,2018-07-19,[''],Great well marked well travelled path!
243,2018-07-16,[''],fun easy hike with and it's fun to play in the water
244,2018-07-13,['hiking'],Fun hike for the family. The walk in has shade and the area near the falls is a great place to sit or walk in the water.
245,2018-07-09,[''],"We truly loved this Trail. It was beautiful.  once we made our way to the falls, it was easy to walk through the shallow or parts of the Little River to be able to see all sides. Highly recommended."
246,2018-07-08,[''],"Vey easy hike, until you get to the falls. If you want to hike to the top, plan to get your feet wet.  Totally worth the effort, it's even great for kids! "
247,2018-07-08,[''],I love this trail. It was easy. It is a little bit hard to get to the donut fall. I went there in the evening around 5pm so there was not many people as people mentioned.
248,2018-07-06,['hiking'],Fun rock/log hopping at the end but oh so crowded.
249,2018-07-06,[''],"This hike is really beautiful. We arrived around 8 in the morning and it wasn't busy at all. We only passed one group coming up. However, coming down we passed multiple groups on their way up."
250,2018-07-06,['scenic driving'],This was a five star trail. Good for all ages. Highly recommend!!
251,2018-07-04,['hiking'],This is a really fun little hike in a wonderful canyon. We went during the fall when the leaves were yellow. This hike is only worth it if you ignore the signs and get up into the donut. Also prepare for lots of people. This trail if you were alone would be a 4 star.
252,2018-07-04,[''],"This was so much fun! Be prepared to hike through a shallow stream. The water is freezing, but it’s worth walking to the back of the waterfall for a picture. The trail is easy, but gets very crowded; honestly, if you don’t get there before 9am, I wouldn’t bother."
253,2018-07-04,['hiking'],A great hike. One of my favorites. It can be a big rough if you’re not much for steep parts when hiking but I enjoy it very much. There is a part you must go down and up rocks to see the doughnut area but just the few of the waterfall is enough
254,2018-07-02,[''],"It's a pretty easy hike, just be careful when you get to the waterfall. It's pretty slippery so wear good shoes. You *can* climb up the waterfall but it's not the safest, I overheard someone telling his buddy how his friend back in high school climbed up and fell straight through the cave and all the way down, breaking both legs, an arm, and a few ribs. So climb at your own risk, the view at the top is neat and there's a small swimming area. It's packed full of people and families"
255,2018-07-01,[''],my problem with this trail is just how crowded it always is. it's so hard to find parking and everyone crowds around the area with the falls. there are better trails to see a waterfall than this one.
256,2018-06-30,[''],The hike is amazing! It’s pretty easy until you get to the waterfall and then it gets a little tough but very doable. I offer 2 criticisms. There are a lot of visitors. A lot. There are too few trails. There is a main “highway” and that’s it.
257,2018-06-30,['hiking'],this hike is even prettier in summer than winter. it is not very hard but very crowded. I would recommend either bringing waterproof boots or water shoes like tevas or you won't be able to see the waterfall donut at all.
258,2018-06-29,[''],Way too many people for a Friday during the day.
259,2018-06-29,['hiking'],"Love this hike. We have done it on Christmas Eve and again June 16, 2018. It can be busy, but the falls are a great pay off. Be prepared to walk through the stream and enjoy the cool water."
260,2018-06-28,['hiking'],"Since this was our first time doing this hike, I was very disappointed that the REAL trailhead wasn’t clearly marked. We 59, 31, 5, 3 year olds parked just off the road and walked to the REAL trailhead, so a 1.5 mile hike turned into FOUR. Some guy, I’m sure thinking he was being funny, said it was another 2 miles. A kind young lady told us, honestly, it was just around the next bend. I was ready to quit and go back to the car. Please don’t send me emails touting the Pro/Pay version when the free side is so wildly inaccurate. This hike should be considered moderate because of the inaccuracies. Many parts of the trail were like a dry, rocky riverbed and very steep."
261,2018-06-27,[''],"This would be a beautiful trail. However we advise that you pack water shoes. In order to actually get to the waterfall you have to carefully goes across the creek/river. Your shoes will get wet, so plan accordingly. GPS bring you to a completely different trailhead. Donut falls is actually down the road from the restrooms on the southeast side of the road. It’s about a mile to to the trailhead. There is limited parking. Other than that, it’s easy and pretty."
262,2018-06-26,['hiking'],My son and I went on this hike. We started at the main road and walked all the way in and hiked to the falls and back. It was fun and easy enough for him. Highly recommend it.
263,2018-06-24,[''],"This is a beautiful, easy, family friendly hike. We had a great experience here and will be back for sure. We started around 7:00 p.m. in the summer and were in the cool shade the entire time. It was a great way beat Utah's summer heat. Next time we will probably bring shoes that can get wet since you cross the river a little bit at the end."
264,2018-06-24,['hiking'],Solid fun trail. The falls are beautiful and unique as the falls fall into a cave hence why its donut falls. Definitely a fun hike even with kids.
265,2018-06-24,['hiking'],"If you want to get to the place where the waterfall cuts through a rock, you have to climb a semi-steep rock face. Difficulty can vary with water-level."
266,2018-06-24,[''],People everywhere ☹️.
267,2018-06-21,['hiking'],Great hike for something quick. Awesome views. Water is really cold so would recommend not falling in. it was pretty crowded. Toward the end is a one person at a time part which takes alot of time to get people across.
268,2018-06-20,['hiking'],"Very pretty and easy hike! The only thing I would recommend is waterproof shoes or boots, I wore Chacos and it was a bad idea. The water is freezing! We went around 8:15pm so i'm sure in the middle of the day heat, it's a bit better."
269,2018-06-18,['hiking'],"Went on a Saturday afternoon & loved it! We didn't know that you could park right at the start of the trail so we ended up hiking from the very bottom of the parking lot. I just started working on getting fit so it was easy for the people I went with, but harder for me. We didn't take the main trail. There's an easier trail that is down the road more. It's longer but not as steep. There was hardly anyone that took this way so it was nice. The falls were beautiful & it definitely had the right amount of shade along the trail."
270,2018-06-18,['hiking'],too many people... but beautiful
271,2018-06-17,['nature trips'],"Donut Falls is a short hike, great for a quick easy outing. It is very heavily trafficked, mostly by families. Go early if you want to park close to the trail, or you have to park on the main road.
To get to the actual donut fall you have to climb the face of a minor waterfall, and it is in a cave at the top. 
Usually this isn't a hard task but as of now it is still runoff season. You can't stand under the falls right now because the water is too fast. It is definitely dangerous now and I would save this hike for later in the summer if you really want to enjoy the cave and the water."
272,2018-06-17,[''],"Beautiful trail and features, and a short, easy hike. Can occasionally be crowded, typically on the weekend."
273,2018-06-16,[''],Super easy hike for the whole family. Can be really crowded on the weekends.
274,2018-06-16,[''],Super awesome!!! One of the most beautiful trails we’ve done since moving to the wasatch back.
275,2018-06-15,[''],Great Hike!
276,2018-06-15,[''],"extremely crowded. nice hike, but people were rude. dogs were up there even though it says no dogs. pretty sights, would recommend going when less people."
277,2018-06-14,['hiking'],"Great trail. We arrived just after 8 and there was only one other car in the lot and they were leaving. We left around 10 and the entire lot was full with another 15-20 cars lining the road. Short, pretty, and perfect for slow hikers and children. We did it with a 3 yr old and a 1 yr old in packs. Our 3 yr. old did the majority of the hike back by herself w/o difficulty."
278,2018-06-14,[''],Easy hike and very pretty but if you want to actually get up to the top or in front of the falls there’s a bit of rock climbing involved and you’re feet will definitely get wet. It’s cold water too so I recommend waterproof socks/shoes. Climbing all the way up isn’t necessary. There is still a beautiful view from the bottom but if you do climb up you can see the top of the donut which was gorgeous
279,2018-06-14,[''],Easy trail. Bit crowded.
280,2018-06-13,['hiking'],Easy trail. Quite crowded in the summer
281,2018-06-11,[''],Pretty but crowded
282,2018-06-11,[''],Great hike for family but very crowded.
283,2018-06-11,['hiking'],"Short and crowded, but beautiful and well worth a hike."
284,2018-06-10,[''],"This hike is extremely short and easy. The plus sides: beautiful, anyone can do it, cool waterfall at the end. The only real downside is the large of amount of people that hike this trail. Which, for many, is an upside because they can bring their kids, as it’s so quick and easy. The best part of this trail for any experienced hiker is the end. This is the only part of the trail that gives you a scrambling opportunity and any sort of challenge. While I was up past the point of everyone else, I noticed there is a small trail that continues up and along the water. I followed it for about 10 minutes before turning back, because I was with family that didn’t follow me to that point. When I made it back down the waterfall, I realized the family must’ve begun the trek down already, so I ran down the mountain. 4-5 minutes later I reached the trailhead, where they had been waiting for just a few minutes. That’s how short the trail is. The only time I would want to do this trail again, is to explore well beyond the waterfall. Otherwise, it’s too short, too easy, and too many people for my liking."
285,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"This hike has always been one of my favorites. I enjoy it each time we go, from when I was little to now with my own kids."
286,2018-06-06,['hiking'],"We went with our 9 month old in her Lille baby carrier. The road to the trailhead is now open. It was pretty crowded even for a weekday evening. The trail is beautiful with lots of trees and great views. However, once we got closer to the falls there was a steep rock where one must get down to actually view the falls. We didn’t do this because it seemed risky with a baby. The trail is otherwise very kid-friendly and there are decent spots where one can get a view of the creek."
287,2018-06-05,['hiking'],Beautiful!
288,2018-06-03,['hiking'],Awesome hike!!! Did this a week ago and would highly recommend it. We had a large group ranging in age from 39 down to 4 years old. The 4 year old was able to do it. Be careful of the mud after any rain.
289,2018-06-02,[''],Easy hike with beautiful scenery
290,2018-06-01,[''],"Very busy when we did this two weeks ago, but a picturesque trail. Plenty of scrambling opportunities at the end to get closer to the waterfall."
291,2018-05-27,['hiking'],Water is pretty high with run off and gate is still closed so that adds a mile to hike. Chipmunks are out and adorable.
292,2018-05-26,['hiking'],Pretty trail but way to crowded. Probably better during the week.
293,2018-05-24,[''],"Nice hike. It's very busy during the summer season, but still fun."
294,2018-05-24,['hiking'],"We hiked it with our little one (9 months) she was in a carrier the first time for her. The beginning part you have to hike the road because the gates aren't open to drive it yet. We started about 7 and two moose crossed our path. We saw deer as well, the nature part was amazing. The trail was easy to follow and the scenery was green. The trail was muddy and slick, wear trash shoes with plenty of traction. Enjoy the beautiful colors, the weather was overcast it had just rained and was cold. Hiking in the evening wear layers."
295,2018-05-23,[''],My friend and I hit the trail afternoon in a rainy day. we couldn't make it to the donut falls as it started raining at the part where the climbing became complicated so you have to walk on rocks by the side of the river. it would be risky in dry days though. views of the snowy top mountain are amazing. Enjoy!
296,2018-05-21,[''],"Awesome easy trail through the jungle. Great for kids and adults equally.

the climb till the fall is little risky and difficult because of cold flowing water.l which may not be the case in summers.

just do this one to be in harmony with nature."
297,2018-05-19,['hiking'],"always. so. crowded.
so many inappropriate teenagers (I sound so old"
298,2018-05-18,['hiking'],"Fun, easy hike. The scenery is fantastic. I went up on May 15th, 2018 in the evening. The ground was damp and there was a decent amount of mud, as well as a couple of places with super packed snow (super dirty snow that blends in with the trail). The water level is kinda high, so I got kinda wet climbing on the rocks up to the waterfall. The rocks are slick and wet, so be careful."
299,2018-05-18,['hiking'],Easy very popular trail. Hiked this yesterday and there were several people. Climbing on top of the rocks is a little scary right now as the water is high. If you want to climb inside the falls I’d wait a few weeks.
300,2018-05-15,[''],"Super easy trail, and such a beautiful lay off at the end!"
301,2018-05-14,[''],Love the hike! Easy trail and great reward at the end!
302,2018-05-14,[''],Spur of the moment we decided to take our 6 & 9 year old on this hike. Great hike and a beautiful waterfall. We all really enjoyed it and want to take friends next time.
303,2018-05-06,[''],Still a decent amount of snow up there
304,2018-05-06,[''],Went up this afternoon. Was very very crowded. The road in is still closed. There is still quit a bit of snow which was slushy and pretty muddy today. We normally love this hike but not today. I hiked it with my 6 and 10 year old.
305,2018-05-01,['hiking'],Great hike once the snow melts. There are sheets of solid ice so add more time to your hike and don't rush it! Have some shoes with traction on them or you'll be slipping and sliding up and downhill lol other than that. The falls were beautiful and I'll be back when the trail is more drier :)
306,2018-04-28,[''],"Went on April 27 and the road that leads to trail was closed which adds a half mile. The trail still had a mixture of snow, ice and slush. I would definitely recommend waterproof shoes with good grip. if you come prepared it's still a beautiful hike."
307,2018-04-27,[''],"April 22, 2018 
There is a foot of packed snow in the entire trail. It is Very icy for a good part of the trail. Bring spikes.
The falls were almost completely covered in snow and you couldn't really see them."
308,2018-04-23,[''],"Great hike! Still snowy I recommend wearing water proof, great traction shoes. still super fun in the snow."
309,2018-04-22,[''],Best view and love the squirrels there!
310,2018-04-22,['hiking'],"We visited Donut Falls yesterday. Beautiful hike. Beautiful day! We are from California so I never anticipated snow on the trail considering the beautiful weather. It was compact & easy to navigate mostly, in tennis shoes. As the day wore on the snow became slushy. Few icy spots & a few muddy areas. Very well traveled in & out. We made it to the waterfall & my husband to the donut hole. The mountain was covered in snow & quite step so we stayed at the bottom and enjoy the view of the waterfall & the stream. Would definitely visit again."
311,2018-04-17,[''],"Scenic hike. Our trip was cut short by a moose in the middle of the path. There are still some patches of snow that you’ll have to go over, but nothing deep."
312,2018-04-15,[''],Great trail!
313,2018-04-02,[''],We just went (April 1) and it was still very snowy and we made it to the top but was very difficult at the top peak to see the fall. When we got up it was all frozen and there was only a little cave that you could see water falling thru if you got down low enough. I would highly recommend to wait til later in the year!
314,2018-03-19,['hiking'],"A beautiful and magical hike when there's several feet of snow and even more falling. Nothing too strenuous, but it's not noted that you have to park right of the highway and hike roughly an additional .5 mile to get to the trailhead. The snow was hard packed enough that hiking boots were sufficient, though many people had snowshoes. The little climb to get to the cave where the falls are was a bit slick without any kind of spikes, but still doable."
315,2018-03-02,['hiking'],The trail is hard packed all the way to the falls. Spikes come in handy for the final accent. Really cool icicles on the falls right now.
316,2018-02-06,['hiking'],Beautiful covered in snow. Easy hike with spikes on (lots of ice). A bit windy too.
317,2018-02-05,['hiking'],"Awesome short hike. Beautiful scenery most everywhere. I hiked from the Spruces Campground for an extra long walk through the quiet forest. The last stretch is treacherous during an icy winter; bring boot spikes. Big difference during the winter? Hardly ANY traffic, especially early in the mornings."
318,2018-02-04,['hiking'],A good short hike that ends with a beautiful view in multiple directions. Be prepared to walk a ways up a snowy road to the trailhead if you go during the winter time.
319,2018-02-03,[''],Great trail. Some icy spots. Beautiful waterfall in a cave at the end.
320,2018-01-30,[''],"Easy hike with just snow boots. If you want to go all the way up to the waterfall, spikes would be a good idea. Went on a Sunday afternoon and it was not crowded at all. Very pretty and scenic."
321,2018-01-22,[''],Did this twice. Extremely busy. Too many people.
322,2018-01-14,[''],I lots a silver eternity ring at the trailhead today taking pictures. If anyone happens to find it I would love to have it back. I’ve weary it everyday for over 10 years. Thanks. orangemusicnote@gmail.com.
323,2017-12-17,['hiking'],Gorgeous hike during gentle falling snow.
324,2017-12-10,['hiking'],"Easy hike, even in the snow."
325,2017-12-10,['hiking'],Great hike in December. Lots of snow and ice so crampons were very helpful. Falls are really cool. This trail only lost one star because of the high traffic. I recommend going at an off-peak time.
326,2017-12-10,['hiking'],"This is a short trail/ about .8 miles to the trailhead from the parking lot during winter- and another 1.5 to the falls. Very easy. There is a part that with snow and ice can be tricky, but even with that I would say anyone 3+ should be able to complete the trail with ease. A lot of beautiful trees, cool river, and I nice waterfall ending. A little shirt for
My personal liking but a nice trail nonetheless"
327,2017-12-03,['hiking'],Good for amazing photography.
328,2017-11-26,[''],Good for families with small children..also there's another cool trail called lake blancha trail right at the end of it
329,2017-11-26,[''],"Looked nice but didn't actually hike it.  Walked from highway to trailhead on closed road, saw some moose, turned around.  Trail completely covered with slippery snow too slick for our boots."
330,2017-11-20,['hiking'],"Easy hike. A quick trot to some nice falls. Expect to park out from the trailhead, which added time to our hike."
331,2017-11-16,['hiking'],Hiked this on 11/15. No snow on the trail.
332,2017-11-11,[''],No snow on the trail in early November and a well worth it hike. Definitely go all the way up to the falls.
333,2017-11-09,['hiking'],"Well worth it, very nice with the family but heavy traffic."
334,2017-11-06,[''],Highly trafficked
335,2017-11-02,[''],Great hike for a family or if you want to take it easy. Awesome little waterfall at the end. Would suggest wearing or bringing water sandals if you’re doing this in good weather.. you’ll cross some streams and it’s more fun not to worry about getting your shoes wet!
336,2017-10-25,[''],"Was more impressed by the 7 Mule Deer, Pot Bellies(chipmunk type rodents), unique birds, and the pretty snowy trail than I was the not so waterfall. More like flowing stream is all."
337,2017-10-22,['hiking'],"This was a lovely, easy trail. When my husband and I went yesterday, the road to the parking lot was closed. We parked at the parking lot right off the main road and walked up to the trailhead and kept going. It's a nice hike to add onto another hike (like we did earlier in the morning) or even for a short by-itself hike. We finished it right before the snow hit so it wasn't as slippery. Be mighty careful, though, hiking down or up the actual waterfall itself. While we didn't do either, we watched people slip coming down. I would caution against doing so, without the proper trail shoe that has some grip. Also, be hesitant with your kids. Unfortunately, right when we arrived at the falls, we saw a family hiking down the actual falls and the daughter fell off a rock and hurt herself. Be careful!"
338,2017-10-22,['hiking'],Super slick and icy during this time of year. I fell like 4 times and was not wearing the proper shoes. Bring a hiking pole! Super pretty though!
339,2017-10-17,[''],"It is an extremely crowded trail. A few jackasses even brought their dogs, which is illegal in this canyon. Really easy hike with a beautiful waterfall at the top. Good for kids and elderly people, bad if you don't like heavily trafficked trails."
340,2017-10-17,['hiking'],"Easy trail, good for kids. Plan on getting your feet wet. Very popular trail, the day we did it there were so many people there."

343,2017-10-12,['hiking'],Nice hike cool waterfall...crazy busy when went in July but I would do it again.
344,2017-10-10,[''],"Enjoyable hike! Not too hard,  not to easy!"
345,2017-10-08,['hiking'],Nice easy trail but it was very crowded.
346,2017-10-06,[''],"Easy hike, great in fall!"
347,2017-10-06,['hiking'],The lack of signs got me turned around but I eventually found a small parking lot past some private property. It’s shorter than I mentally was prepared for so that was good. You will have to scale the waterfall in order to get to the little cave - just be careful because currently it’s getting iced over. Easy to the base of the falls but after that is some bouldering.
348,2017-10-03,['hiking'],"Super easy hike. Great to walk and talk with friends. It was extremely crowded. Also, make sure to wear appropriate shoes if wanting to climb up to the waterfall. It's super slippery and rocky."
349,2017-10-03,['hiking'],This is our homeschool field trip today!!! We used to go to Donut Falls with my parents and grandparents.
350,2017-09-30,[''],Very easy. Rocks are slippery when climbing up the waterfall. Worth the climb. Don’t go on a weekend! Way too many people.
351,2017-09-26,[''],"Easy hike, went a little beyond to the inside and top of the cave. Be careful if you decide to climb on the rocks - very slippery! Beautifully unique waterfall"
352,2017-09-26,[''],"The best part of this trail was turning a corner, and staring face to face with two male moose. Very beautiful hike!"
353,2017-09-20,['walking'],"This is a very simple hike. It's pretty, but short and easy. The end you come upon the falls and it says to not climb the rocks, but we did it anyways and most everyone does. It's worth it too."
354,2017-09-18,['hiking'],Easy and beautiful. Crowded as to be expected. Be careful climbing up the rocks to the falls. They become very slick.
355,2017-09-17,['hiking'],This hike is for everyone! Bring water shoes or be willing to get yours wet... it'll be worth it.
356,2017-09-17,['hiking'],"It was a pretty great little hike, but it was crowded."
357,2017-09-14,['hiking'],5 stars if you go early but this trail and falls can get packed with people quick.
358,2017-09-14,[''],"nice hike, but very crowded and its popularity attracts people who don't necessarily respect nature. great time with kids, otherwise would take a pass."
359,2017-09-11,['hiking'],"Go up the waterfall at the end of the trail. Well worth it and way more fun, also where the waterfall is. You can exit at various sections of the canyon if you run into trouble.  Bring shoes to get wet."
360,2017-09-11,[''],Short hike that's family friendly. lots of trees and greenery. the end of the trail is up a rocky hillside through a stream. so if you want to see the cave and the waterfall it's best to bring shoes and clothes to get wet.
361,2017-09-11,['hiking'],"Fun, easy, pretty hike. We saw 3 moose when we were almost back to our car (near the trail head)."
362,2017-09-09,['hiking'],great short hike to a beautiful waterfall. Deffinatley worth climbing up the waterfall a bit so you can see the donut at the top. The water falls through a donut shaped hole in the rock and into a cave. You can wade into the cave and stand right next to the water.
363,2017-09-09,[''],"Go early, less people on the trail during the week. Climb up into the waterfall could be challenging for some, but we someone carrying a baby in a backpack up to the actual hole/falls with little issue. Be prepared to get wet, wear hiking sandals or shoes you don't care about."
364,2017-09-08,['hiking'],"Not a fan. After years and years of hearing everyone rave about this hike, I finally did it myself and I was not impressed. First complaint is it was SWARMING with people! If you are looking for alone time in nature, this is not the hike for you. Also, It's not much of a ""hike"". Took me 20 minutes to get to the base of the waterfall. You get a perfect view of it, not sure why the need to scale slippery rock to get to the top and see the entrance of the waterfall. No thank you. My hiking boots kept slipping, and I wasn't about to plummet to my death. I turned around and went home with nature blue balls."
365,2017-09-06,[''],I love this trail with my wife...
366,2017-09-06,['hiking'],Lovely short hike. Does require maneuvering up/down slippery rocks at times. Saw two bull Moose a turn into the trail! Waterfall is quaint but peaceful.
367,2017-09-06,['hiking'],Beautiful
368,2017-09-05,[''],"For those who aren't in great physical condition, the trail is doable but NOT ""Easy""!  It's not paved and has several hills along the way."
369,2017-09-03,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. I loved climbing up the river to reach the waterfall. I liked that it was more than just a dirt trail.
370,2017-09-02,['hiking'],"Donut Falls is short, albeit rewarding, hike in Big Cottonwood Canyon. All you have to do is follow the signs that say ""trail"" as there are offshoots you can follow but won't get you to the falls. We went twice during Pioneer Day weekend and by the time we were done, the trail was starting to get busy so if you go on a weekend, go early."
371,2017-08-28,['hiking'],"This is one of my all time favorite hikes. The scenery along the way is absolutely beautiful. We came across a huge moose and it was the highlight of the hike for me and my kids. The directions will take you right to the trailhead. This is a super popular hike though, so during the Fall go in the morning of during the day during the week. If you want to see the waterfall from the top I would suggest water shoes otherwise you'll almost certainly get your feet wet."
372,2017-08-19,['hiking'],Short hike for amazing scenery. Cool doughnut formation waterfall.
373,2017-08-19,[''],"A short, well traveled nice hike with waterfall area (would be difficult for some people to get down to - those with very young children or possibly older folks). Parking is difficult if you get there past mid morning."
374,2017-08-18,[''],Gorgeous hike and super easy
375,2017-08-18,[''],"Easy trail up until the waterfall. If you're with children you may need two adults to get them down a steep rocky area down to the base of the falls. Then, you need to walk over rocks to get to the waterfall area. I had on water hiking shoes so it wasn't a problem but some of the kids I saw that didn't want to get their feet wet struggled. Overall it was beautiful, well worth it. We did it with a baby and toddler. You can't really picnic or anything by the falls. Kids/toddlers can walk it."
376,2017-08-18,['hiking'],Great trail! Nice falls. You can't get a good view of the falls unless you climb. If you want photos without people in them GO EARLY. Otherwise there's people Everywhere!
377,2017-08-17,[''],Beautiful and quick and easy!  Only a few minutes and gorgeous scenery!
378,2017-08-17,[''],"Lots of people on the trail which made it less enjoyable. I would not categorize this as easy! I had a blast as did my 12 and 14 year olds, but many families had smaller kiddos shrieking with fear, falling into the water, or being browbeaten and shamed into climbing up big slippery rocks."
379,2017-08-16,['hiking'],"Kind of boring.  When we went, Cotopaxi was doing some scavenger hunt thing where you ""eat a donut at Donut Falls.""  Meaning there were tons of annoying people who were throwing donuts in the bushes and pushing past you.

My husband was wearing our baby so we couldn't hike up to the actual ""falls"" part, just to the bottom of it.  You can't see anything from the bottom so unless you are willing to hike to the actual ""falls"" it is kind of boring.

In & out in less than an hour; again, that is without hiking all the way to the waterfall.  I'm sure young kids love this hike, we saw a lot of them.  Great for families."
380,2017-08-16,['hiking'],"Awesome waterfall with an easy hike. You can climb up the falls into the ""cave"", but be careful. We saw a lot a kids not being supervised even though it is inherently dangerous. We went up the falls. Very cold inside, but worth getting soaked."
381,2017-08-16,[''],"Easy trail, extremely used.  I've done this 3 times in the last 5 months and winter with snow is hands down the best time to do it,  less people and a rope to climb up to the falls."
382,2017-08-14,['hiking'],"We did this hike the first week of June, and the water was too high to feel safe hiking to the Falls.  So we hiked up to see the water fall through the donut from above.  The kids felt that was totally pointless!
Today we hiked it again, and this time we made it not just to the Falls, but up to the Donut.  My two kids with special needs that affect their gross motor skills stayed at the base of the Falls.  They probably could have made it up to the Donut, but there is no way they could have climbed back down.  My 7 year old and I loved climbing in where the water falls through.  I'm so glad we went back!  Everyone LOVED the hike this time."
383,2017-08-12,[''],It's a short hike with a few rough spots. Definitely get there early. We got there around 7:30 am on a Saturday. There were people already coming back down and some about to go up. When we came back there were people driving around looking for a parking spot. Watch out for bikers. They are everywhere and some will not let you pass them.
384,2017-08-11,[''],we took our cat and he turned into an adventurer! love the scenery on this route. It's super simple!
385,2017-08-08,[''],Always a fun trail. Great for kids as well.
386,2017-08-08,['hiking'],Great short 3.2 mile round.
387,2017-08-08,['hiking'],A wonderful easy hike. A little bit crowded - but still nice & relaxing
388,2017-08-07,['hiking'],This was a fun with the kids.
389,2017-08-07,['hiking'],What a good hike! Getting to the bottom of he waterfall is very easy but it's an adventure to get to the top. Not easy but worth it
390,2017-08-05,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. The wildflowers were a nice bonus. A little scramble down some rocks and then some walking through\across the river to get to the base of the falls. Get there early to get close parking.
391,2017-08-04,['hiking'],"Very easy hike to get to the falls. You can also hike up to an overlook that's above the falls, very steep but quick and it's an amazing view. To get to the actual donut you have to traverse some rocks up a steep incline but it's much easier than it looks."
392,2017-08-03,[''],I love this trail it's not difficult at all which is good for my bad back.
393,2017-08-02,[''],easy trail. anyone who marks this less than a 4 star is an idiot
394,2017-07-31,[''],"Ya this is not a kids friendly hike. The 15 feet down the rocks was do able but then you had to hike through the creek which was maybe 4"" deep. The part we stopped at was climbing round 75 feet up rocks to get to the doughnut.

The first 95% of the hike was easy, but the last 5% which is the whole reason why we did the hike was not easy."
395,2017-07-31,['hiking'],"This was a good simple hike up to the bottom of the falls. The rock climbing up the falls to get to the donut was easy enough for my seven year old. My older two kids really enjoyed climbing it too. We were lucky enough to be able to play around in the cave and run through the falls. The water is ice cold and there are lots of friendly hikers along the way. Parking is few on the trail, like only 12 spots, so we parked in the lot and walked up to the trail."
396,2017-07-30,['hiking'],This hike was more of a walk not a hike which was not our cup of tea. Also highly trafficked!
397,2017-07-29,['hiking'],Good for families. Small children okay until you reach the bottom of the falls. Very steep to reach falls. Requires more of a bouldering skill than hiking. Recommend good waterproof hiking boots/shoes for this section.
398,2017-07-28,[''],"Great views, easy ascent, good with kids or as solo hiker. Ends at a cool/unique waterfall.  Path well marked and a good variety of sceneries (mountain views, along a creek, through a forest)."
399,2017-07-28,['hiking'],"Had a blast with my kids on this one. Short, yet beautiful. Popular trail, so start early in the morning to avoid crowds. Gate to trailhead opens at 7:00 am, but we parked and walked in. We'll do it again for sure!"
400,2017-07-28,[''],Classic hike for visitors!  But easy???  I wouldn't call it that. There is some rock manipulation to tackle....
401,2017-07-27,['hiking'],Great hike for a hot day!
402,2017-07-24,['hiking'],Good hike expect to get your feet wet.
403,2017-07-23,[''],"This was an awesome trail. This app made it so easy to find for me.  There are so many interesting trails around Utah but don't know where to find them


This hike was fun, and matched the description"
404,2017-07-23,[''],Very crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Hike up to the waterfall was not so child friendly.
405,2017-07-22,['hiking'],"Such a quick and easy hike to a beautiful waterfall. Its a great hike if you only have an hour before dark like my bf and I did. Love it . Lots of people, so if you are looking for seclusion DO NOT go here! Happy hiking people :)"
406,2017-07-22,[''],Was a great hike but can be hard for smaller children to get up to the donut because you have to climb up some steep rocks. Other than that it was awesome.
407,2017-07-19,[''],"A lot of fun!  Easy hike to beautiful water fall.  Plan to get your feet wet if you want to hike to the falls.  Slippery , but well worth it."
408,2017-07-18,[''],Busy but beautiful- plan to get your feet wet.
409,2017-07-17,[''],"The trail is heavily trafficked but well maintained. I have an issue with the easy rating though. The hike itself is easy but then you get to a 20 foot rocky drop off you have to climb down to finish the hike to the falls.

We also started from the Spruces campground that adds an additional 3/4 to 1 mile each direction. We did see a few really pretty birds and tons of pot guts and chipmunks. We will do this hike again but will be better prepared next time."
410,2017-07-16,[''],"Crowded, but the weather was fantastic"
411,2017-07-13,['hiking'],"Great trail for an easy out and back for all ages. Stay to the left at the fork and it leads you right to the waterfall. Once you're at the waterfall you can either enjoy the sites or try to cross and get closer. Seems like a lot of people do the latter so something cool to check out. Only downside is that it can get pretty crowded on the weekends so just keep that in mind. 

Also, watch out for moose on your way in and out in the meadow next to the main road. The last two times I was up in the area there were two separate moose. Very cool!"
412,2017-07-13,['hiking'],"Easy hike with a truly beautiful waterfall at the end! Usage is high so if you can go during the week or in the off-season you may be able to avoid some of the hiking traffic. If you want to get close to the waterfall bring shoes that can get wet, as you have to cross the stream to reach the base of Donut Falls."
413,2017-07-13,[''],It was great
414,2017-07-11,['hiking'],"This is a great family hike. If you have more than one car, be sure to park as many as possible at the UTA park and ride at the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Parking by the trail is limited."
415,2017-07-10,[''],"Great hike! It was pretty easy, but our feet definitely got wet. We climbed up to the falls and on top - the water was really strong so didn't actually go inside.

Giving 4 stars because of the people. The amount there didn't bother us even though it was fairly crowded, but the trash did. Please pick up after yourself if you go!"
416,2017-07-10,[''],This hike was great! We took our two young kids with us and they loved it
417,2017-07-08,['hiking'],"There is a reason this is the most popular hike in the Salt Lake valley. Gorgeous views, great for all ages and skill levels. If you plan on doing this hike on the weekend, go early (we hit the trail at 8 am and just missed a line of people trying to get to the falls)."
418,2017-07-07,['hiking'],Beautiful hike.. lovely falls.. plan on wet feet!
419,2017-07-07,['hiking'],"A nice short, easy hike to do if you're not looking for a challenge while hiking."
420,2017-07-07,[''],"Great hike offer little challenges for children, lots of shade areas to rest on the way."
421,2017-07-05,[''],Terrible.  no signs and directions put you on the opposite side of road rather than parking lot and narrow trails
422,2017-07-05,[''],"Heavily populated, a bit of a scramble up the falls. Excellent views at any level!"
423,2017-07-04,[''],Compared to others falls in Utah that we have hiked to this one is a huge disappointment. It's an over populated easy hike. I was so excited to finally go see it and was hugely disappointed once we got to it. It's nothing compared to some of the falls in Utah that we have hiked to. Easy for kids or anyone to do. It's more of a tourist attraction than anything. I can at least now say that I have seen it but won't be going back to it.
424,2017-07-03,['hiking'],"Very easy hike until you get to the base of the falls. Getting up to the ""Donut"" is steep, but definitely do-able, just be cautious. There was too much water for us to get into the cave, but it was a gorgeous view at the top! The water is freezing. We brought water shoes to hike through the stream and up to the donut, which ended up being super convenient."
425,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"This was such a beautiful hike! We took tons of pictures, and it wasn't super long either. Wear shoes you're okay with getting wet, if you think you'll wanna get into the water. Super fun and pretty hike."
426,2017-07-02,['hiking'],Nice easy trail. Technically you're not suppose to enter the water since it's a watershed.
427,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"the trail is not too difficult until right near the falls. kids handled it with no problem. definitely lots of hikers though, not a place to go if your looking for seclusion."
428,2017-07-02,[''],Nice trail. Good and easy. But it is very crowded.
429,2017-07-01,[''],"This is a very easy hike to the falls and then it is a bit of a climb to get to the cave and ""donut hole"".  It is a great pay off at the top! The pool in the cave was quite cold, but a great way to cool off.  There are lots of wildflower and chipmunks along the trail."
430,2017-06-29,[''],Definitely not a strenuous hike at all but the last part of getting to the waterfall it's pretty steep. Lots of people in the summer!
431,2017-06-28,['hiking'],Fun hike. Water is COLD but feels kinda nice on a hot day. The trail is easy enough until you get to the water. Gets a little trickier but still fairly easy. Had a great time and will go back!
432,2017-06-27,[''],"As mentioned, this is a heavily trafficked trail. When we did this trail on 26 June 2017 there was probably over a 100 people we saw on the trail including a large group of kids from a nearby camp. Not a trail for solitude. 

The ""trail"" gets pretty hairy if you actually want to see the falls at the top. The water is very cold but the view is worth it."
433,2017-06-25,['hiking'],"Very beautiful and fun to do with the whole family. The water was freezing but after the hike to the falls, it felt great!"
434,2017-06-25,[''],Crowded and overrated.  Plenty of other hikes with waterfalls with less people.
435,2017-06-24,['hiking'],"Easy hike from the trailhead, but park near the highway for more of a walk.  We took a toddler and it was a good activity for him.  He loved the water when we got there.  There is no way to actually get to the waterfall without walking through some water, at least that I found."
436,2017-06-24,[''],If your hiking from the main road its 3 miles round trip.
437,2017-06-23,['hiking'],Fun hike especially if you go above the falls. Lots and lots of people though.
438,2017-06-23,['hiking'],"Lots of people but not a problem. Trail splits off to go above the waterfall, too. Easy and short enough to go back and do both parts of the trail. Lots of water rushing now, so you can't climb close to the falls or under the donut as pictured in several photos people have posted. So don't expect that? Definitely interesting to go to the upper trail and see the ""donut"" hole that the waterfall goes through since you can't tell from lower part. Upper trail is mostly shaded."
439,2017-06-21,[''],"a blast. definitely go on a weekday, not a weekend"
440,2017-06-20,[''],I love it
441,2017-06-20,[''],Great for kids! You must walk up the river and picnic at the base of the falls. But it's ice cold!!!
442,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"We love this hike to kick off the summer. Fair amount of shade and easy for the youngest hikers. We did not climb to the donut as the water is very high/fast yet (June 15) for two young children. We went earlier in the day so it wasn't as busy. Parents, please don't let your children feed the wildlife though."
443,2017-06-18,[''],Amazing views and great for beginners
444,2017-06-18,[''],"Great trail for all ages. Impossible to get to the donut without getting wet, so either wait a few weeks or be ready to hike down with wet shoes."
445,2017-06-16,[''],"nice hike for the kids, so much water now that you can't get too close to the falls."
446,2017-06-14,['hiking'],
447,2017-06-12,['hiking'],"Crowded, easy, fun."
448,2017-06-11,['hiking'],
449,2017-06-09,['hiking'],"Hiked with my 7 year old. It was fun but short. The river is raging right now, so you can't get very close to the falls, as it has overflowed some of the path. We hiked up to check out the view from above the falls and it was pretty, but not a very clear path. Still had a fun time and would recommend this short hike."
450,2017-06-08,[''],Beautiful but it is usually packed in the summer
451,2017-06-08,['hiking'],"Good, easy hike with some nice scenery. The falls were cool, but it was tough to get a good view of them with how much water is flowing."
452,2017-06-07,['hiking'],"Beautiful area, easy trail. Water is still high so we didn't go up to the donut as we had some small children in our party. Still pretty from the base though."
453,2017-06-07,['hiking'],"First Hike ever ...plus first hike in Utah.  Very easy, but the water is Cold"
454,2017-06-06,[''],"Easy, good for me and my kids.  It was beautiful and nice & cool on a hot day."
455,2017-06-05,['hiking'],Excellent family hike. Well shaded trails options. Stay creek side right to get to upper view of waterfall. High creek flow will prevent walking to the base of waterfall.
456,2017-06-04,['hiking'],Great hike. Fairly easy. Water is running high and fast.
457,2017-06-04,['hiking'],Easy going with an amazing view when the water is full.
458,2017-06-03,[''],"Don't stop at the first falls. There's a trail that goes up and behind the lower falls, and follows the river until you get to the top. The donut is a large stone hole the river falls through. Very dramatic and well worth the extra hour of hiking."
459,2017-06-02,[''],"Very unique falls, quick hike from the trailhead."
460,2017-06-01,[''],Lovers it super easy kid friendly
461,2017-05-31,[''],"Fun, easy, short trail. Lots of great sights and other hikers. Seems not many (I didn't see anyone else) knows the other trail to scramble right down to the falls."
462,2017-05-31,['hiking'],"Much easier hike than I thought it'd be.  There are many different ways to go when your get to the falls, we went up the back to look down on it.  Would have loved to go through the river up to the falls but the water was a little fast so I opted not to.  Hoping to return later this summer when it's not so high and explore more!"
463,2017-05-31,['hiking'],Nice family hike.  A few areas of snow on the trail but mostly dry.  Make sure that you bring an extra set of shoes if you plan to go up the falls.
464,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"Still a bit frozen near the top, including part of the donut. The last 5 yards are in the river itself with minimal opportunity to avoid getting your feet wet. This is one of the more crowded trails I've seen in the area, so be warned (though that could have just been holiday weekend traffic)."
465,2017-05-30,['backpacking'],"Nice walk in the woods for families. To get all the way to the falls, plan on getting a little wet. (Keep a close eye on little kids while crossing the river until the snow pack thaws and the river isn't running as quickly)."
466,2017-05-30,[''],"Great hike for families with kids slightly on the older side. 6 and up maybe, unless of course you plan on carrying your little ones. Water shoes highly recommend because the last 50 yards is literally in the creek. You'll also want to boulder up the cascades and enter the actual donut shaped cave where the water fall has carved a hole in the rock. Really cool. Obviously use caution during high water season."
467,2017-05-30,[''],Awesome trail for the family
468,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"Easy 30 minute walk to the river, then some snow and mud.   Need to walk through the ice cold water to get to see the falls up close."
469,2017-05-28,['hiking'],crowded trail with some snow at the top (May)
470,2017-05-28,['hiking'],"Although there were lots of people and the trail was slippery muddy from some of the snowpack melt off, this trail was super fun! We were able to take my 7 year old brother along with us."
471,2017-05-27,[''],Get to the trailhead by 8 and you can beat the crowds! A little muddy but the falls are pretty with some snow still on the them.
472,2017-05-24,['hiking'],"Absolutely wonderful!! Easy hike, some mud and slush but nothing too bad. Once you reach the water, it's a slippery climb to the top. Be prepared to get your feet wet! So worth it!"
473,2017-05-20,['hiking'],"Super fun and exciting hike if you plan on hiking up the waterfall. It was well worth it as long as you be careful hike climbing up. Bring an extra set of clothes if you don't want to freeze. Make sure you are looking  at the map though, I accidentally hiked the wrong route and hiked an extra 2 miles up from the waterfall."
474,2017-05-19,['hiking'],"From the recent snow melt, the river and falls were flowing rapidly (according to locals). Still some snow patches along trail, but not impassable.  Sat at the base of Falls and soaked in the sounds and sights.  Be careful if attempting to climb up to Falls, snow is getting undermined from water.  You'll get wet, but enjoy the experience!! Also, as of 5-15-2017 the paved road up to trailhead was still closed."
475,2017-05-18,['hiking'],Avoid going on a Saturday on a beautiful summer day. There was soooo many people that we had to stop and wait 5 minutes at a time here and there because there was a bottle neck of people. Yeesh.
476,2017-05-14,['hiking'],may 12. road closed .can't get to it due to snow
477,2017-05-14,['hiking'],"There was still a decent amount of snow on the trail today, but definitely worth it. Got some gorgeous pics with the snow in the background."
478,2017-05-14,[''],Didn't quite make it to the falls because there was still quite a bit of snow but always a beautiful hike!
479,2017-05-13,[''],"Super easy hike with a good payoff at the end. I went 5/12/17 and there was a decent amount of snow, but it was paved down. The flow of water right near the falls was fairly high, so don't expect to make it without walking in the steam a portion of the way. Also, within the falls the water was hitting around knee height. A easy, must-do hike here in the valley"
480,2017-05-10,['hiking'],lots of snow but over all was a great hike :)
481,2017-05-08,[''],"This is a very easy trail, and nice if you're looking for a short one! The donut is beautiful, and has a little bit of climbing you can do once you get to the end. They're very serious about having no dogs on this trail, basically in the entire canyon. So be cautious!"
482,2017-05-07,[''],"This was a fun hike,  lots of snow and so fun using the rope to make it to the falls."
483,2017-05-05,[''],"nice little hike for exercise, hiked it in May and there was snow from the second parking lot to the falls. looking forward to going back in summer"
484,2017-05-03,['hiking'],"Trail was still completely snow packed, but path was easy to see and follow, just be prepared to slip and slide a bit and get wet because of it. Made the trail harder than I expected, but boy that payoff was amazing! Be sure to head up and into the cave of the falls, otherwise you miss that payoff"
485,2017-05-03,['hiking'],"Still lots of snow, poles are a great idea, hike over the top of the falls back to service road slippery and treacherous, through snow up to the knees! Not recommended until snow is gone! Gorgeous hike, moderate difficulty in the snow."
486,2017-04-28,['hiking'],"This trail is gorgeous and super easy! You can't bring dogs anywhere up big cottonwood though so be forewarned before you make the mistake of trying!

It's nice for summer because it is pretty cool with the water and most of the shade. A nice hike you could do anytime of the day."
487,2017-04-22,[''],Tip: keep left.
488,2017-04-21,[''],"Short and easy hike but very pretty! Some fresh snow today so bring your hiking boots or snowshoes. You have to cross a small stream but nothing major. You do have the option to hike to the top at the end although advised against my crew
Couldn't resist. It was worth the view and you can climb inside a cave surrounding the waterfall."
489,2017-04-21,[''],even with a few feet of snow this trail was enjoyable
490,2017-04-18,[''],"before you go... don't follow the gps. based on the footprints most people do and we ended up passing it by a couple miles. fun hike still But when you see the bathrooms half way up, stay left.  it's a flatter more direct path to the falls.  super slick right now as the snow is melting wish I would have worn picks. beautiful hike though!"
491,2017-04-17,[''],"Followed the trail according to the apps GPS and never found the Falls. Two other groups of hikers ran into the same issue. Snow made it difficult to follow trail signs exactly, but ended up being fun regardless."
492,2017-04-15,['hiking'],"Went a little too early in the season, lots of snow and wasn't able to make it to the actual falls due to the snow but it was a fun and adventurous hike none the less. People were climbing the canyon wall to the falls and using the snow packed canyon wall to slide the entire way back down. We decided to head back in the summer when it wasn't so snow packed!"
493,2017-04-15,['hiking'],"A destination hike, so you should surely get in and behind the cave of the falls. Snow is melting everywhere and it can be slippery at places. Wear good boots to enjoy this trail before April."
494,2017-04-09,[''],"I took off before the crowds and at a great time to see moose in the area of the houses on the right as you start up. The last part up to and in my case into the cave where the falls enter is a rock or boulder scramble and it's easy to allow the excitement to propel you up the rocks at a faster pace than is safe so take your time and enjoy picking your route up. Once at the entrance you'll see it's a must to get inside and enjoy the falls up close. I brought along sandals for the water section and anyone wanting to fully enjoy it should also wear a pair of pants with either zip off Legs or plan on rollin the legs up, you won't want to miss going inside."
495,2017-04-02,[''],"Great trail to go on anytime of the day. My brother and I went mid afternoon and even with the snow on the ground, it wasn't difficult to get to the top of the falls."
496,2017-03-26,['hiking'],"Very icy and slippery this time of year and chilly in the canyon, prepare for a snowy hike!"
497,2017-03-26,[''],love it during winter.
498,2017-03-24,['snowshoeing'],Perfect winter night hike. 
499,2017-03-19,[''],Still really snowy up there! Very slippery!
500,2017-03-19,[''],Me and my 12 year old daughter had fun on this hike yesterday. With the snow it made it the perfect workout- not too easy and not too hard. We hiked to the very top of the falls and used the rope they had there to slide down with our jackets!
501,2017-03-08,['hiking'],Beautiful snowy morning. Nice view all along
502,2017-03-06,['hiking'],Great for winter hiking. A bit intense near the top but it's worth it! Overall it's a pretty easy trail with some great views.
503,2017-03-05,[''],"We used snowshoes and it was more intense than an ""easy"" rating!! If there is snow, prepare to walk on a slick trail and a very difficult ascent to the Donut cave!"
504,2017-02-18,[''],Great winter hike but in the summer its over crowded with little kids running around screaming everywhere.
505,2017-02-01,['hiking'],Donut Falls Trail was packed but well worth the crowd!  I happened to go up on a Sunday that also happened to be father's day. I was lucky to have found parking.  The trail was an easy one shared with a lot of families and you have the option once you reach the falls to stay at its base and enjoy the view or you can climb the rocks all the way up to the donut and even past the ledge where you will find a beautiful stream running over more rock and fallen trees.
506,2017-01-30,['snowshoeing'],"Loved this hike. We used snowshoes, but most hikers were just in boots or had crampons. The falls are awesome in the winter. There is so much snow up there right now...had a great time tromping off in the deep snow."
507,2017-01-29,['hiking'],"I hiked this today in regular snow boots! The trail is so packed down now that I was okay not wearing snowshoes! Of course, the majority of people do use snowshoes though. It was beautiful and fairly well-marked for being so snowy. You do have to walk about a mile up the road from the parking lot to get to the actual trial because the gate to drive up is closed for winter. It was a great hike- not too hard, not too easy (because of the added difficulty added by snow). I will definitely come back to this hike during the spring."
508,2017-01-28,['hiking'],Great Hike!  Trail is so packed you don't even really need snowshoes.
509,2017-01-07,[''],"Really nice hike. The last bit climbing up next to the waterfall to the ""donut"" is a bit dangerous, but it's beautiful, once you get there."
510,2017-01-04,['hiking'],Beautiful. One of my favorite hikes. Very easy. I like to go up in the summer because you can drive to the bottom of the trail vs. before or after when you have to walk there. Very fun. I enjoyed climbing to the falls.
511,2016-11-14,[''],"Water level near the falls is pretty low, which makes crossing the creek and, for the ambitious thrill seekers, climbing to the top waterfall much easier. The trail is pretty muddy past the official trailhead, so be careful of slipping.

Upper trail head parking is closed for the season, so you'll be adding an extra bit of time and distance to your hike. Keep left at the forks, and be weary of slippery rocks."
512,2016-11-13,[''],"Is the trail closed? November 13 today, but I see people tracked their hike this month. App says it's closed October"
513,2016-10-27,[''],Great hike for my family including 3 year old. The app does not take you to the trailhead. It says to park on the left. You actually have to drive up a road to the right a bit to get to the parking lot/bathroom. We hiked about 1000 feet up the trail to the left. It actually goes to a lake but we turned around and drove across the street.
514,2016-10-26,[''],Easy trail and GREAT for kids. Bring extra socks 
515,2016-10-23,[''],"This trail is super easy until you get to the falls at the end. You have to climb up a rock wall to get to the cave at the top where the ""donut"" is. It's very slippery and cold, but if you manage to get all the way to the top it is really awesome. I wouldn't recommend this for small children. It would be to dangerous for them to climb the rocks."
516,2016-10-22,[''],Turn right onto Cardiff fork road to get to the trail head!
517,2016-10-09,['hiking'],Took a two year old and four year old on this hike. Was a little long for the two year old. Very muddy and slick from snow patches. Beautiful colors though. Read a review that said the trail was on the opposite side of where the app takes you but that wasn't the case. We just got to cross the street twice. Trail head was on the south side by a large parking lot and restrooms.
518,2016-10-07,[''],Super fun
519,2016-10-03,[''],Nice easy hike with beautiful colors!
520,2016-09-30,[''],"Great little trail, i ran it but would recommend it for anyone (including families with kids). One note, the trailhead is on the opposite side of the road than what the app says (it's on the south side)."
521,2016-09-28,['hiking'],"Nice falls, but the trail was not very well marked.  With the assistance of fellow hikers I managed to find the falls.  Saw 5 deer and two moose during the hike.  Would like to go back and find the cave when I have more time."
522,2016-09-27,['hiking'],"We opted not to finish when we ran into a moose and his girlfriend. Beautiful creatures, beautiful hike. Will go back to reach the end!"
523,2016-09-26,['hiking'],Did this hike today.  It was a beautiful hike.  There is (limited) parking at the trail head up the road.
524,2016-09-26,['hiking'],"This was a great trail to hike. Be aware though, if you have small children with you, or if you don't climb too well, there is one spot where you have to climb down about a 10 foot rock wall. There is also a small stream to cross, though it's not deep at all. Once you reach the falls you can stay at the bottom and enjoy the scenery from there, or you can  climb up some moderately difficult rocks to get to the cave. Keep on climbing to get to the top. What a view!"
525,2016-09-26,['hiking'],Most overrated hike in the Wasatch.
526,2016-09-26,['hiking'],"My kids and I did this one on Sunday night just to stretch the weekend out a little longer. It's an easy walk, good for having silly conversations with the family. And of course we couldn't resist climbing the rocks at the end. It's great!"
527,2016-09-25,[''],Nice hike. Not difficult at all. The falls was more of a trickle but still pretty nice. My 10 year old was able to do this hike no problem. Not overly crowded but a fair amount of people hiking. Recommend this hike for sure.
528,2016-09-21,['hiking'],"Donut Falls is more like a walk to me, great for kids but wish I could bring my dog. Hiked up over the falls and back into the mountain a ways, it was beautiful."
529,2016-09-20,['hiking'],This trail hike was wonderfully exciting with views into the valley below. Lots of traffic on a Saturday and Sunday.
530,2016-09-18,['hiking'],"We really enjoyed this trail. It would be a 5 star worthy if there would have been less people. There was literally people everywhere. I have been on less busy city sidewalks. 

That being said it was a beautiful trail and the leaves were changing. It was really fun!"
531,2016-09-17,[''],"love! great, short, gorgeous hike. the water is very cold. awesome after work trail, easy to run"
532,2016-09-15,[''],I completed this hike with my 2 yr old and 3 yr old. The entire hike was doable with young ones with the exception of climbing to the top of Donut falls. The scramble was a little too much for the babies. Still a fantastic hike
533,2016-09-12,[''],Nice for kids pretty view at the end
534,2016-09-11,[''],"The hike was easy, but beware of slippery boulders near the end of the hike. Donut falls isn't much to look at from below where the trail takes you. I had my young children, so we didn't dare scale the rocks to the top, although I bet it's beautiful from up there. Overall it was just okay. Nice little hike, but not all that great unless you're willing to risk your life at the end!"
535,2016-09-09,[''],"The waterfall at the end is the coolest part. We climbed up, regardless of the signage telling us not to. Rebels."
536,2016-09-06,[''],Have snowshoed this trail and love it for that. Too crowded of a hike. All the ppl ruin the experience.
537,2016-09-06,['hiking'],Simply amazing day.
538,2016-09-06,[''],The hike was great. Only issue I had with this is all the trash left along the trail and near the falls.. People need to pick up after themselves.
539,2016-09-05,['hiking'],We came with several friends. It was a lot of fun. The only drawback was there were so many people! Way too many. Great hike anyways.
540,2016-09-05,[''],"easy hike, lots of people"
541,2016-09-02,[''],We saw moose and walking inside the donut hole and walking over a log to get closer was fun. Gf wouldn't let me get too close to see on top but would of been fun to look directly over. Short hike but was good prep for lake Blanche
542,2016-08-29,['hiking'],The best time to go is around 9 am. It's nice and cool and it's not crowded. The trail was clean and it was beautiful. You do have to climb up some rock at the very end to see it well. But the trail to get up there is really easy. Your feet will most likely get wet so expect that.
543,2016-08-28,[''],The water is so clear and beautiful. I went in the falls and it was freezing cold. I loved the trail and playing in the water❤️
544,2016-08-28,[''],The waterfall is so fun to climb!
545,2016-08-27,['hiking'],Short hike with a great payoff. The falls are gorgeous. The hike has a challenging incline for novice hikers but I saw plenty of grandmas and children completing the whole trail. Be careful of trail forks because the correct path is not always marked but there are usually enough people hiking that you can just follow the flow. You will have to cross the stream at the end and your shoes might get wet.
546,2016-08-25,['hiking'],Great afternoon hike. Saw a young bull moose on the way back down. Not from an area with mountains so I thought it was a little more difficult than an easy but not too overpowering.
547,2016-08-23,['hiking'],"I loved this hike years ago, but the trail has washed out sometime since the last time I've done it. Now you have to cross the river and scramble up the rocks to get to the falls. It's still nice, but not as nice as it once was."
548,2016-08-22,['hiking'],"Easy hike up to the falls. Your feet will get wet. Be prepared! Moderate/hard rock scramble up the top of the falls is optional, but to get in the ""donut"" you'll have to do it! Lots of slick rock. Packed with families. Beautiful views at the top. Overall, I'd do it again."
549,2016-08-21,['hiking'],"if you're going to come here early don't come before 7am unless you don't mind walking in from the main road to the trailhead. the gates to the road up to the trailhead does not open til 7am. we came early and parked in the lot just off the main road and walked approximately half mile up the road, past the private homes to the trail head. Super easy hike and judging from the trash along the trail it's popular. majority of the trail is covered and great for kids."
550,2016-08-20,[''],Easy for kids I really loved it
551,2016-08-20,['hiking'],Beautiful and worth the trail and the end with a refreshing splash!
552,2016-08-18,['backpacking'],Easy for young children. Lots of fun
553,2016-08-17,['hiking'],Loved it!
554,2016-08-15,[''],First part of the hike was the paved road to the trailhead. Beware of cars if you hike from the bottom.
555,2016-08-10,['hiking'],
556,2016-08-05,['hiking'],"This was a great hike with mostly easy terrain.  We took the left fork and did encounter some boulders that we had to climb down in order to get to the creek.  Poles could come in handy crossing the creek at the end.  I didn't track the distance but it seemed shorter than 2 miles in.  Then again, the trail was so easy that it didn't require rest stops.
""Heavily Trafficked"" is an understatement.  If you wait too long in the day, you will find yourself waiting in line to climb up/down boulders and obstacles.  Parking at the trail head is very limited."
557,2016-08-04,['hiking'],Great short hike fit for the whole family. Climbing the rocks up to the cave are a bit tricky but well worth it.
558,2016-08-03,['walking'],"Great hike for my 6 year old and me! He loved rock climbing at the end to see the donut! Not nearly as busy as I was expecting, but we went on a Tuesday afternoon."
559,2016-08-02,['hiking'],"We arrived around 9am in a Tuesday, easily found parking in the lot and headed up. Never being here before I wasn't sure what to expect! The trail to the falls was easy for my seven year old, but once we got to the falls we were unable to see the donut feature. In order to get to the cave we were told we had to climb up the wet rocks. We made it half way but my little got scared and we went back down. Very cool none the less and I want to return without kids!

Be prepared for wet feet! As we were leaving some girls were trying to walk on rocks worried about their shoes... Parking lot was full when we left as was the rode leading to the trailhead (around 11am). 

Best part: we saw a deer!"
560,2016-07-31,[''],We went at 8:00 am and there was just a handful of people up and back. We even enjoyed the falls by ourselves. As we were leaving the parking lot people were starting to flood in. We know from experience that this hike is something you do early in the morning because of the amount of people (especially kids).
561,2016-07-29,[''],It was very pretty and easy...but far too crowded for us
562,2016-07-29,[''],One of my all time favorites!
563,2016-07-29,[''],"Beautiful hike. Lots of squirrels, Aspen and people. Went on a Wednesday night and probably saw 100 other people."
564,2016-07-28,['hiking'],"Easy, quite crowded.  Worth the effort.  We hiked from Spruces campground."
565,2016-07-28,[''],"Easy trail, just plan on wet feet. lots of people."
566,2016-07-27,[''],Easy trail but we took the wrong one and had to walk back down to the creek and walk about 5 minutes into it and climbed up donut falls it was so worth it
567,2016-07-26,['hiking'],easy easy but wear wet shoes at the end
568,2016-07-25,['hiking'],Love this hike a bit crowded but love to climb up into the cave. That makes it all worth it.
569,2016-07-24,['hiking'],"This was a really easy and quick hike - maybe a 30 minute hike to the falls. Once you get there you have to walk through a freezing cold creek for about 10 minutes to actually get to the ""donut falls"" section, but once you get to the falls/cave area it's absolutely fantastic. There's a hole at the top of a cave with water gushing through it, hence donut falls. You can actually go inside the cave, if you're man enough, and view everything up close. I highly recommend this hike to anyone! Great time. Oh and I know I mentioned this, but your feet will get wet."
570,2016-07-22,['hiking'],We love this hike and try to go every year.  Avoid the weekend crowds - it gets nuts up there.  We like to bring a box of donuts to enjoy.  Water shoes would be a good idea to more easily cross the water at the top.
571,2016-07-21,[''],"Great family hike with lots of shade. The falls are really pretty,  but the wet rocks can be slick. Our adventurous  teenage son climbed to the top and actually fell through the donut. Fortunately, he wasn't hurt, but he certainly could have been!"
572,2016-07-20,['hiking'],Nice early morning hike.
573,2016-07-20,['hiking'],Very busy.  Parking lot off main road is 1/2 mile from the trail head.  If you have little kids it's worth driving to the trail head to see if you can find a closer spot.  Easy hike for all ages.
574,2016-07-18,['hiking'],Great family hike
575,2016-07-17,[''],"One of my favorite ""beginner"" trails, it started my love affair with hiking."
576,2016-07-16,[''],"The perfect hike for a family with kids. Even on a hot summer day, the temperature is comfortable. Water, a snack and bug spray are recommended. There are plenty of places for some great photos. I'd recommend parking just off the road and walking in as opposed to trying to get a parking spot right at the trailhead."
577,2016-07-14,[''],"Family loved it.  Easy hike until you get to the end.  A little bit challenging with toddler.  Be ready to get your feet wet, and bring extra shoes to change into after.  It's worth it going all the way to the top to see the water falls and the hole.  Watch out for slippery rocks.  Have fun :)"
578,2016-07-13,[''],"pretty easy hike. it can be crazy crowded on weekends and i have never been on it without seeing other people. the falls are beautiful, but there can be quite a bit of garbage in places."
579,2016-07-11,['hiking'],Great short hike to a really interesting watetfall. I would recommend arriving early. This trail can get rather busy. We started at 0800 and it was perfect. Not real busy. On the way up to the waterfall we ended up seeing a moose. On the way back down the trail it started to get real busy and once we got back to the trailhead the parking lot was full and people were parking along the road.
580,2016-07-11,[''],"It's a fun little hike, but insanely crowded, we didn't spend too much time at the falls since there were so many people. But way easy hike."
581,2016-07-11,[''],nice
582,2016-07-08,['hiking'],Pretty easy trail that is great for kids/non-hikers. My only complaint about Donut Falls is that it is often really busy.
583,2016-07-04,[''],Great quick hike in the area when water fall is flowing
584,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Pretty easy, some places it's difficult to figure out which trail you use, and it would've been nice if the park ranger would've told us about the easier side! All in all, really cool trail, lots of little wildlife running around and the falls are really cool!!"
585,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Perfect evening hike but expect to see lots of people due to its popularity. I suggest wearing sandals so that you can walk on rocks in the cold water. When you get to the falls, it's best you just admire the scenery at the bottom if you're inexperienced. If not, it's a fun scramble to a cool view of the falls! Perfect way to cool off, too."
586,2016-07-03,[''],"nice hike. 4 kids did great. didn't make it all the way to the top as the rock climbing for my 8 and 9 year old so
was too steep. I recommend driving the mile farther to the trail head... especially for someone with small children. Having to park in the lot just makes it that much more walking for kids in the heat. water was cold and rocks were slippery, but it was beautiful.  Busy trail for sure."
587,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Doughnut Falls is an easy hike with beautiful views throughout and several cascading waterfalls. This is a fun summer hike and is pretty in the fall too. During late June and July you can see lots of wildflowers along the trail. 

This is a very popular trail because it's easy enough for even young kids. I recommend arriving by 9am so you can get a parking spot in the small lot by the falls trailhead and avoid the crowds. If you hike it mid-morning or afternoon it will be a zoo. It is regularly so busy that people park along the main Big Cottonwood Canyon road and walk down the road to get to the trailhead. Better to just arrive early. 

To get closest to the falls, for the best views, you're probably going to get your feet wet. And prepare yourself, the water is cold! When we hike it in mid June, the water was at least a foot deep crossing the stream. Water shoes would have been very helpful. But we forgot to bring them so we just got our hiking boots wet."
588,2016-07-02,['hiking'],Short but pretty. A little crowded.
589,2016-07-02,['hiking'],The hike was great and pretty easy! It is only crowded where the river crossings are or the more challenging parts. Just because people are being cautious so they don't get hurt but other than that I would recommend this hike to all ages!
590,2016-07-02,['hiking'],"Nice short family hike, if you have little kids. Not a trail I would visit regularly. Gets a little crowded."
591,2016-07-01,[''],nice little stream to pick through at the end toward the falls.
592,2016-07-01,[''],Easy good for kids until the end were you have to climb the water fall to get to donut
593,2016-07-01,[''],"Don't believe the title. There's no donuts on this trail. Beautiful hike. We climbed the water fall all the way up. Looked hard when you see it at first, but it's easier to climb than it looks."
594,2016-06-30,[''],great trail! great hike for the family esp young kids!
595,2016-06-30,['hiking'],
596,2016-06-29,['hiking'],The overall trail was nice. I parked up in the parking at the end of the private property road. It took me awhile to find it. I'm a bit hefty so the steep incline about killed me. But I pushed through and it was a beautiful hike. But the trail ends before the falls so I didn't actually get to see the falls. My friend who is more athletic then me went but she slipped and fell once because of how slippery the rocks were. The first part of the hike is family friendly. The second part not so much. It was a shortish hike but I'm not going to be doing it again it didn't peak my interest that much to come back.
597,2016-06-27,['walking'],"Easy nice hike. Cool down by the water. Lots of shade, birds, chipmunks."
598,2016-06-27,[''],Little strenuous for the first 10 mins uphill but everything after was perfect!
599,2016-06-26,[''],Great hike. Way too many forks win the trail without signs though. Took the wrong way twice and had back track.
600,2016-06-26,['hiking'],Nice short hike.  It felt great to walk in the ice cold water!

602,2016-06-26,['hiking'],"This hike is very crowded. Couldn't get to the falls, because there were too many people huddled at the top."
603,2016-06-25,[''],"Super easy, kid friendly hike. Gets really crowded, so go early."
604,2016-06-23,[''],Nice hike
605,2016-06-23,[''],"Very highly trafficked trail. Was hoping for a little more from how much I have heard about the hike. Rather short--very kid friendly hike. When we went, there was so much water!! Too much to get in or anything. Overall, this hike took about an hour and a half, but we started from the high parking lot, which the walk to the actual hike was longer and harder than the actual hike itself."
606,2016-06-22,[''],It was a great hike for my two little boys. They did it no problem. It was a beautiful hike! Enjoy
607,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"Very popular hike but that's understandable given how easy and accessible it is. You're technically not supposed to climb the waterfall but everyone does it anyway. If you choose do to this, just be careful because it's easy to slip and fall on the jagged rocks (learned that the hard way). Good hike for beginners, lovely waterfall!"
608,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"Great hike, easy enough for kids and short and sweet.  Off the main canyon road you can drive to the trail head depending on how busy it is to get a parking spot.  The hike is shaded in many spots.  Once to the falls your feet will get wet because you need to cross the creek to get to the main attraction."
609,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"Love this hike it's a cute simple hike that I took my family on. My 7 year old and 11 month old, toddler friendly and loved the donut water fall."
610,2016-06-22,['hiking'],Very beautiful hike. I really enjoyed this hike with my friends.
611,2016-06-22,['hiking'],Donut falls is a fun little hike. Very family and kid friendly! There's a pretty waterfall at the end! bring water shoes if you plan on climbing up the waterfall!
612,2016-06-19,[''],easy kids friendly.
613,2016-06-19,[''],"the trail is easy for kids. the waterfall is nice but you have to walk a bit in the water, the water is pretty cold and maybe not that easy for small kids.
the trees and flowers along the way are great , but it is way tooooo crowded that it is no longer fun."
614,2016-06-18,[''],"Fairly easy hike. It is longer when you have to park along the highway. The actual falls can be seen from below, but to see why it is called Donut Falls requires scrambling up a more difficult rock area than most younger children can do safely."
615,2016-06-16,[''],"We loved this! Unfortunately we couldn't find the trailhead so I think we added about 2 miles onto our trajectory. We finally found it after we were nice and sweaty already. You'll have to turn right off of the main road and head up a little ways until you can't drive any further, there will be a little parking lot there. The trees are huge and amazing. The falls were really gushing so it was too dangerous for my kids to go up too far, but it was gorgeous. Lots of people there for a Sunday night but really a great experience anyway."
616,2016-06-16,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful. Went in the morning and it wasn't too crowded.
617,2016-06-13,[''],Gorgeous. Waaaaay crowded. to the point where we had to wait in line twice to pass a narrow part of the trail.
618,2016-06-13,['hiking'],Good trail to take kids on. The runoff was too swift so we had to stop at the part where you get down next to the water.
619,2016-06-13,['backpacking'],Killer!!
620,2016-06-12,['hiking'],I wish there was a bigger payoff at the end.  brought our 4 year old son and he did great.  family friendly
621,2016-06-09,['hiking'],Easy trail except towards the falls the trail drops off and you have to climb down rocks. Many people seem to miss it and end up on another trail. The water was high and I had little ones with me so we did not hike to the cave.
622,2016-06-06,[''],Great
623,2016-06-06,[''],we did this one Saturday.  easy hike. pay attention  to trail signs near the f or or you'll miss the left turn to the falls. water temp was around 42 and high so plan ahead. great hike for family
624,2016-06-05,['hiking'],"This is an easy trail and very doable with small kids (had 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 yrs). Right now the water is still a little too high and fast for the kids to cross the river so we didn't get all the way to the falls. We'll go back later in the summer. It's beautiful though!"
625,2016-06-04,[''],Love this hike! If you don't want the trail to be crowded it's best to go first thing in the morning.
626,2016-06-03,['hiking'],one of my favorite hiking trail. not that difficult and good for the first timers. and the climbing up to see the donut falls is the craziest part of it and i just love it. make sure to wear waterproof shoes guys!
627,2016-06-02,[''],Short hike but fun.
628,2016-06-01,['hiking'],"Great hike, took the fork on the right instead of left where the falls are. Took the trail as from as I could. First hike in years, great hike for getting back into the outdoor game."
629,2016-05-31,['hiking'],"This is an interesting trail. Definitely easy, the first half is paved on a road. Unfortunately it was extremely crowded on memorial day and hard to enjoy because of that."
630,2016-05-31,[''],"Very family friendly. was really crowded the Saturday we went. Rocks slick and still snow on the ground, but is awesome hike."
631,2016-05-31,['hiking'],Great for beginners! Family Friendly
632,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"Great trail. The directions said that it was on the left but it's actually on the right. The gate was closed when we went on Memorial Day weekend, so it was a longer hike. We ended up climbing up above the falls which was fun but a little scary. Bring shoes to get wet in because your feet will get wet crossing the falls!"
633,2016-05-28,['hiking'],Really beautiful foresty hike with a great waterfall at the end.
634,2016-05-27,['hiking'],"If you live in salt lake, you can do the whole trip and trail in under 2 hours, so this is a great get outta the city hike, or worth doing if you are in the area. 

Still was snow on the ground in late may, but the water falling through the snow made it even more majestic. 

Five stars because it's everything  you need in a short hike."
635,2016-05-26,['hiking'],"It was a fun hike - there was still snow on the ground and lots of mud (5/25/16), so be prepared for that. Only one or two points where we had to actually climb up and over rocks up to the bottom of the falls. If you want to go on to the top you have to cross the river and then it's quite a steep climb for a little way."
636,2016-05-23,['hiking'],"Easy hike, lots of fun, waterfall is pretty neat."
637,2016-05-15,[''],"It was amazing, bring shoes that will get wet and destroyed, it will be a small price to pay those shoes! Great for family fun and awesome views!"
638,2016-05-15,['hiking'],Great hike! All uphill to the falls but that just makes the hike back easier. Lots of friendly people.
639,2016-05-14,[''],"love the hike. This place is ALWAYS crowded.  Go during the week and in the morning for the best parking and less people . Even then,  it gets crowed fast."
640,2016-05-12,[''],Fun and very easy hike but pretty icey right now by the actual falls so it's a bit of a bummer trying to climb up
641,2016-05-05,['hiking'],"Great short hike.  If you want to get up to the main cave you'll have to do some climbing.  When there is still snow on the ground it's nearly impossible to get up without ice traction for your shoes, so make sure to bring a pair!"
642,2016-05-02,['hiking'],"It's slippery. People are sliding along the trail causing it to lose traction. Still a nice hike. Not hard. The beginning is steep, even tho it's paved, it elevates quickly. Great pictures.

The rope broke at the end to climb up to the donut, but you can still get up. Be careful coming down, you might as well just slide down."
643,2016-05-01,['hiking'],"A bit slippery on the packed snow, but the falls are incredible!"
644,2016-04-23,['hiking'],it's still snow covered which means it's not crowded yet. stay on the packed parts of the trail or you'll risk sinking. the falls are gorgeous. hope to visit again.
645,2016-04-19,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes, have done two times in the summer and once in March. The time I did it in March the gate blocked us off so it added a few miles but the hike was not awful. Great hike, especially fun because you can hike over and around the falls."
646,2016-04-18,['hiking'],It was great. Went on a cold day so it was not too crowded .
647,2016-04-11,['hiking'],What a gorgeous trail!! It's was paved for the first half mile and no snow.  The rest of the trail was snow packed. We were fine in hiking boots and tennis shoes but very slippery in places. Our hiking poles were great to have with the snow and staying balanced.  The trail and water fall was pretty!! Going back in the fall to hike again☀️
648,2016-04-09,[''],"Went up today (early April).  It was a little slippery on the well packed snow,  but other than that,  well worth it."
649,2016-04-03,['hiking'],"Did this in December without snowshoes and was just fine. Very quick. Nice falls at the end in the winter, with parts still frozen!"
650,2016-03-25,['hiking'],"I hiked this the second weekend of March, so there was still a lot of snow on the ground. Because of this, to get to the waterfall, we had to slide down some snow and into a cave. It was absolutely breath taking! There was snow covering the donut, so where the water was coming through was leaving ice crystals around it. The hike itself was difficult due to the snow, we were slipping all over the place. But if we had on better shoes it wouldn't have been so bad! The land around it is beautiful and I'll definitely be going again!"
651,2016-03-21,['hiking'],My go-to hike! I love it!
652,2016-03-20,['hiking'],Great hike all year round!
653,2016-03-19,[''],there was a lot of snow but great with the kids. we went in hiking clothes and a light sweater we started getting hot going up.
654,2016-03-18,['hiking'],Early March it is still snow-covered and beautiful! Definitely plan to go back when the snow melts.
655,2016-03-12,[''],easy fun hike really enjoyed the falls and cave
656,2016-03-10,[''],"This was an amazing hike. Did it in the winter, so we were the only ones there. Perfect day hike for the whole family."
657,2016-02-13,[''],It's super easy walk the snow makes even better
658,2016-01-20,['hiking'],"Short fun hike, easy to miss trailhead in winter"
659,2016-01-10,['snowshoeing'],"Went with a group of 10, nice wider trail perfect for us all. We all had snowshoes but only about half wore them. They provide some extra traction, but sometimes just got in the way. Trail was quite easy, some scrambling was required if you hiked up to the falls. Nice sunny day, would be fun to take sleds, too."
660,2015-12-30,['snowshoeing'],"Such a fun and easy hike. I went snowshoeing with a friend, we were able to make it all the way. The tail is pretty patted down so it was easy to find. You probably don't even need snowshoes, except they were helpful to get to the top to when the little cave is."
661,2015-11-24,[''],Easy beautiful trail
662,2015-11-04,['bird watching'],"Easy, beautiful trail.  Nice waterfall at the turnaround point.  Were blessed with snow that day, which made the hike even more gorgeous."
663,2015-11-02,['hiking'],"Short easy hike with fun waterfall at end
Great hike for kids and beginners."
664,2015-11-01,['bird watching'],Nice and relaxing trail. There is an atv trail nearby that can add some unwanted noise to your hike.
665,2015-10-25,['hiking'],Nice even short trail. Very nice falls. Climb up to the grotto!!
666,2015-10-25,[''],Nice short hike. Beautiful views. Usually busy. Easy hike for snowshoeing in the winter!
667,2015-10-24,[''],Several friends recommended Donut Falls to us. We have a 3- and 1-yr-old and they both walked most of this trail. We thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful and changing views all along the trail. It was fun to cross the water over the stepping stones.
668,2015-10-24,['hiking'],"Just did this today in about 1.5 hours (with kids). The trail was active but never too crowded. We didn't go up to see the ""donut"" because I fell in the waterfall. But the trail was lovely!"
669,2015-10-24,['hiking'],"It was beautiful. Traffic wasn't high at noon on a Friday. Safe enough for older kids with helmets, lots of razor sharp rocks toward the top. Wear comfortable boots with excellent grip if you intend to see the pot of gold (cave) at the end of the trail!"
670,2015-10-21,[''],Loved coming here in the summer. Easy but really fun and the water makes it a refreshing summer hike.
671,2015-10-18,['hiking'],"A nice quick nature getaway. It is a heavily trafficked trail, but great for families. The water flow is pretty low and you do have to climb up the rocks to see the ""donut""."
672,2015-10-18,[''],Well marked trail. Super short and easy. Very mild elevation. Waterfall disappointing but nice walk through the trees.
673,2015-10-10,['hiking'],"You should get there early if you want to have some quiet while hiking (and get a parking spot at the trailhead), because the heavy usage specified is VERY heavy. It's more of a walk than a hike, but be prepared to climb a waterfall at the end, despite the sign that says not to!"
674,2015-10-07,[''],Super easy and so awesome! ✌
675,2015-10-03,[''],Great family hike. We absolutely loved this trail and the falls.
676,2015-09-28,['cross country skiing'],Not much of a hike and no view...fun climbing the rocks though!
677,2015-09-28,['hiking'],Really easy hike.  Pretty falls.
678,2015-09-27,['walking'],Pretty place but very easy and short. Too many people.
679,2015-09-26,['hiking'],The falls are a bit overrated/ underwhelming but it's a nice trail quick and easy.
680,2015-09-26,[''],Short. Great for kids. Hard to find parking.
681,2015-09-20,['hiking'],Really  to get to fall you have to climb a water fall so you will get wet so bring water shoes with you.
682,2015-09-19,['hiking'],I loved this trail! We've been wanting to do it for a while now but it's ALWAYS busy on weekends. We had to go really early so there was a place to park and little foot traffic up the trail. It was beautiful! Not too long and we saw a moose! Very cool.
683,2015-09-14,['hiking'],Excellent little trail. Quite popular though so it can be packed at times.
684,2015-09-13,[''],Good hike-not too challenging but there is a spot that requires going down a small rock wall. Falls are neat!
685,2015-09-11,[''],"Nice hike, some rock scaling at the end to reach the falls and cave.  Wear good shoes!"
686,2015-09-10,['hiking'],"Very short hike perfect if you have kids and want to get outside.  The falls and scenery are beautiful. 

The trail does experience high traffic so I recommend getting an early start."
687,2015-09-09,['hiking'],Very short and crowded. Still worth a look. fun to snow shoe at night. If you go please carry out your trash. It was a little cluttery the last time we were there.
688,2015-09-09,[''],"Awesome, love hiking to waterfalls, this ones one of my favorites!"
689,2015-09-09,[''],"It was easy, it wasn't challenging, but it was fun to explore."
690,2015-09-08,['hiking'],"Really quick, and easy trail. Nice little waterfall in the spring. You can climb up to the cave at the end of the trail, and it's pretty cool."
691,2015-09-06,['hiking'],This is a nice little trail and fairly busy. I parked in the parking lot next to the highway/main road so it took me a little while longer than what the suggested time was but it was a great way to spend part of an afternoon.
692,2015-09-06,[''],Short and easy
693,2015-09-03,[''],"Fun short hike that's good to do in the winter time. It's fun climbing the frozen waterfall, but be careful. Can get extremely slippery"
694,2015-09-03,[''],Fun and easy snowshoeing trail in winter. Good for the kids
695,2015-09-02,[''],"""Easy"" is definitely an accurate rating (which is what I was looking for), but the trail that leads to the falls was poorly marked, which led to a lot of wrong-turns for myself and several others. The falls themselves were pretty, but by 11am there were literally dozens of groups funneling into the area. A very crowded hike."
696,2015-08-30,['hiking'],With how popular this hike was portrayed I expected a much different ending.  The kid-friendly trail ends at a a river and more advanced hiking begins if you want to actually see the falls.  Not wowed by this hike at all.  
697,2015-08-26,['hiking'],"Super popular trail. It's kid friendly & I would honestly consider it a stroll in the park. We made it up to the base of the falls in 15. Depending how the water is, know that you'll (most likely) get your feet wet. Climbing up to the falls was a little tricky because I had no traction on my shoes whatsoever, but I made it just fine. The waterfall is pretty neat, I expected it to be bigger, but nonetheless it was cool."
698,2015-08-25,['hiking'],"I've done this hike about 3 times. Once last year with about 15 people ages 1 all the way to 60. We didn't go right up to the falls because we did have quite a few kids with us, and getting right into it is a bit tasking. The second was in April and there was still snow on the ground. We got about half way and had to turn back. The third was with my 15 year old nephew in June and WOW. What a cool waterfall. It's a must if you live here or are even just visiting."
699,2015-08-25,['snowshoeing'],Make sure and climb up to the actual donut hole where you hunch down and enter a cave where the water comes through the top. Inside the cave you can stand to the side and not get wet. It's beautiful and unique.
700,2015-08-25,['hiking'],"Great view at the end!  Perfect weather, quite a few people on the trail but everyone was friendly"
701,2015-08-23,['hiking'],"Pretty easy trail! Don't be frightened by the sign that says ""do not climb the waterfall"" because it's totally doable and safe as long as you take your time and are wearing shoes that won't slide on rocks.  It's also totally worth the climb once you get to the top :)"
702,2015-08-23,['bird watching'],Amazing and good for all ages!
703,2015-08-22,['hiking'],Short & sweet. Awesome view from inside the donut.
704,2015-08-21,['hiking'],Easy and great for a quick hike to show off the Rockies to any visitors!
705,2015-08-19,['hiking'],"A short and easy hike with a pretty waterfall at the end.  If you're looking for the greatest reward for the least amount of work, Donut Falls is a great option."
706,2015-08-16,[''],"Easy hike, pretty falls, all in all very pleasant."
707,2015-08-16,['hiking'],Great there needs to be s sign for it though on the main road as well as signs on the trail. Hard to figure it out when its you first time toy can get lost
708,2015-08-13,['hiking'],Good hike if you're not really a hiker.
709,2015-08-09,[''],"Nice and easy hike, great escape from he summer heat. Easy enough for kids had our 8 and 4 year old. Hiked up the fall to the cave, was worth it just be careful and smart."
710,2015-08-09,[''],"Beautiful canyon.  Very crowded hike on a Saturday.  Don't expect solitude.  Good trail for kids, but not infants. Destination is NOT the actual falls, unless you are willing to do some dangerous rock climbing.  There is one dangerous moment scaling down rocks...especially with small children.  I would not recommend anyone younger than 12 climbing to the actual falls unless accompanied by an adult."
711,2015-08-08,['hiking'],Nice hike with young kids. Very busy trail.
712,2015-08-08,[''],"Great family friendly hike! I've always seen photos of the donut but I never realized I had to hike up a water fall to get to it. 

To get to the actual donut, it looks intimidating but children were climbing with parental guidance."
713,2015-08-07,[''],"Great hike, make sure you go inside and then up and over."
714,2015-08-06,[''],"Great hike. Just have to make sure you know what path to take to get to falls. Steep, steep climb up waterfall to get to the donut at the end."
715,2015-08-06,['hiking'],"Very crowded, lots of congestion and confusion about how to get close to the falls. Beautiful hike, tho, and fun to do with the kids."
716,2015-08-04,['hiking'],"One of the most popular waterfall hikes in the Salt Lake area. It is common to share the this short trail with over one hundred other hikers, especially on weekends. We always go on a weekday around 8am and we usually only see a handful of people. The trail to the bottom of the falls is very easy. It is recommended to stay at the bottom of the waterfall runoff. Signs are posted to not proceed past the runoff due to the fact that serious injury could occur when hiking to Donut Falls. If you choose to hike up the rocks and water to get to the cave where Donut Falls drops into, do not take children. Also, do not attempt to take a trail to the left of the falls. In the last couple of years a couple of people have fallen and died while scrambling the steep rocky face. 

For directions, trip information, and photos from Donut Falls, visit http://www.yourhikeguide.com/donut-falls/"
717,2015-07-30,['hiking'],"Beautiful forest on the hike up, but making it to the base of the falls was too difficult with a little kid strapped to my back."
718,2015-07-29,['hiking'],"Most part of this hike in unshaded. Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen please. 

Parking lot is small. Could probably just accommodate 10-12 cars (not sure. maybe more). There are signs that says no parking on the side of the dirt road but people still park there anyway.  But you don't just copy whatever knowing its not right, be patient to wait for somebody leaving to get a spot at the designated parking. it's a short hike so people come and go.

This is very good for a family hike so you can bring our little ones along -- that is if you do not have any plans on going to the top to witness the beautiful donut falls. the first part of the hike is very easy. you will see a lot of little kids hiking and enjoying it. its not steep nor rock. you'll have to cross the stream to get to a good resting place at the bottom of the falls. so again, prepared to get your feet wet. My friends and I make sure that we have our flip flops in our hiking bags so we can soak our tired feet on the ice cold water. 

When you get to the bottom of the falls you'd be wondering where the donut falls is like what you see on pictures! Well, this is where the hard part of the hike comes. you will have to hike through the rocks to get to the top of the falls then you will see the majestic donut falls. this is not just a rocky hike okay...rocks could be sharp and slippery since water from the top is streaming down. if you do not want your shoes/feet to get wet, you can opt to go up through the rocks on the side of the falls but i figured its more difficult if you are not an experienced hiker. after a few slips and bumps, i got to the very top and i was in awe. it was all worth the slips and bumps. 

Most people would not take the risk of going at the top. but you have to. what's the sense of going to donut falls if you won't see the donut right?  But again, going to the top is not a hike for little kids. it could be dangerous.

Travel. Hike. Enjoy."
719,2015-07-27,['hiking'],"There is a fork in the trail early on that isn't marked, so we ended up taking the wrong way and hiked double what we should have, which was kind of unpleasant. Also, this is a popular hike so there are often lines to get through the trail and to the falls. But the waterfall is really beautiful."
720,2015-07-25,[''],"Easy hike. We hiked it with a 3 month old in a front carrier. It's worth getting wet to make it into the cave to see the falls. 
Parking on the weekends is a challenge. It'll be tempting to park on the road where it says ""no parking"" but don't do it. I saw many cars get ticketed."
721,2015-07-21,[''],Fast and easy.  Good trail for young ones
722,2015-07-21,[''],"So fun!! Took my four little kids, and it was the perfect length and level for us all to enjoy!"
723,2015-07-19,['hiking'],"Not challenging, but the falls are awesome!"
724,2015-07-18,['hiking'],Go during a weekday morning or else it's packed. Super short hike
725,2015-07-18,['hiking'],"First time there last week and tried climbing above the water fall and the wall came apart. Fell 8ft into the river and nearly went into the donut hole. 
Tore my hand open so I ruined our family trip there by 
leaving early to get 16 stitches. Plan to return tomorrow tho. 
Ruined my phone in the river so I lost my pics while at the fall. 
Needless to say, don't try to climb above that water fall lol. 

Regardless it was awesome and loved it there. Pics of my cool injury uploaded :)"
726,2015-07-16,[''],We have done this hike twice and love it. Easy enough to take the kids along with us!

728,2015-07-15,[''],
729,2015-07-14,[''],"Nice trail path until you get to the stream that leads to the falls. Unless youre ok with getting wet feet, you'll be hugging the wall for a bit.  Tough climb to get up to the actual Donut Falls site if your inexperienced. Worth it though. Cool looking falls."
730,2015-07-13,[''],Donut Falls is worth the scramble up the boulder field to stand in the cave as the water pours in around you. To share the moment with my seven year old daughter was one I won't soon forget!  Her effort and courage were commendable!
731,2015-07-13,[''],Good
732,2015-07-13,[''],"Super easy, super crowded, it's a good quick hike"
733,2015-07-12,[''],Very easy. Excellent for kids. A lot of people tho..
734,2015-07-12,['hiking'],"Very easy hike.  The kids took every single side trail they could come up with, just to break a sweat.  A bit crowded on weekends, but at least more and more people are outdoors!  If you are going all the way up, there is a very good chance your feet will get wet."
735,2015-07-12,[''],Nice little hike with lots of people on the trail.
736,2015-07-09,[''],"Gorgeous, family fun for all ages and levels."
737,2015-07-09,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes in the Salt Lake area. Super easy and not too long. And the waterfall at the end is rad!
738,2015-07-07,[''],Pretty easy trail for the most part. If you go right at the fork it will take to some upper trails (not always marked) but if you stick close to the sound of the creek you'll soon find yourself up above the falls looking down.
739,2015-07-03,[''],"Very fun! Great hike for all ages!!!
The fall was beautiful. Short technical hike to get to the donut but worth every step!"
740,2015-07-01,[''],"Great! Went with my 5 kids ages 8-9 months and I only carried the 9 month old. Not too busy when we got there at 9:40am, but REALLY busy when we left at 11:45 (we went much slower than normal people because of the three year old and all of the breaks for watching prairie dogs). Great family hike!"
741,2015-06-30,['hiking'],"Fun, but pretty crowded. It is a totally family-friendly hike. One little part of climbing down to rock before you get to the falls it's just challenging enough for little kids to have fun. Those who are saying it's not family-friendly when you climb the falls, well you're not supposed to climb the falls. It's a dangerous thing to do as climbing waterfalls always is a dangerous thing to do. There are signs warning against it. So enjoy the view of the falls and the fun wading at the bottom."
742,2015-06-28,[''],"They really need to put up signs directing you to the falls. The trail splits off two different ways, twice. It's kid friendly only to the bottom of the falls. It was way over crowded, and going any further seemed too risky."
743,2015-06-28,[''],Good kid friendly hike. Plenty to see.
744,2015-06-28,[''],"Very nice, easy hike (until the waterfall). Great climb if you're up for it. Nice picture spots. We would do it again."
745,2015-06-26,[''],Great
746,2015-06-23,['hiking'],"We did this trail last Saturday. It was absolutely beautiful and I loved it, although really crowded. It was a very easy hike until we got to the falls part. I wouldn't call this part of the hike family friendly. Maybe it was the time of year, but there was still lots of water coming down, and the hike up the waterfall is steep and rocky. You have to wade through water to get there. I saw at least 3 children crying over scuffed up knees, and that evening on the news we saw that someone had fallen and gotten stuck on the rocks, and had to wait there overnight to be life flighted out the next morning. Last year a woman died by falling 100 feet down the falls. So pretty, yes; family friendly, maybe not."
747,2015-06-22,['hiking'],"Like others have said, short and easy 30-40 minute round trip! Towards the beginning, there is a split on the trail. The trail going left leads to donut falls and the trail to the right is more uphill and takes about an hour n a half to get up there to some pretty cool mines and stuff"
748,2015-06-20,[''],"This was a fun, easy hike. I was sad when it was over so we hiked a few more miles beyond the falls. Beautiful!"
749,2015-06-19,[''],Fun simple trail. If you want to climb the falls you have to wait until later in the year. At this point the water is running pretty hard and seems pretty dangerous. Still pretty to look at and only about 35 minutes round trip.
750,2015-06-19,[''],"The donut part is broken. It collapsed a few years ago.
Other then that it was a great hike for kids and families. I have a 5 & 4 year old who did really well. 
We went on Saturday at about 11:30 ish. It was busy but not like standing in line. We were always moving and had lots of fun. 
We also parked down off the main road. It was a little bit of a walk to get to the trailhead. 
The top go the hike you are very likely to get your feet wet."
751,2015-06-18,[''],Pretty trail but over crowded with people. Good for beginners
752,2015-06-17,[''],It is busy but fun trail. If you are just getting use to altitude start with an easy trail like this one. The falls are wonderful.
753,2015-06-16,[''],"It's a really easy, fun trail in a beautiful setting. Great for kids, dates, or a quick morning run."
754,2015-06-16,['hiking'],Amazing!! I want to go back
755,2015-06-15,[''],Great hike.
756,2015-06-14,[''],Freezing water but the whole family made it.
757,2015-06-14,[''],Good first hike for kids.
758,2015-06-14,['bird watching'],"This hike was a nice afternoon hike. Easy and beautiful views. Very family friendly. Seemed like a busy and popular spot so we were happy that we parked on the highway instead of driving to the trailhead, where parking was limited."
759,2015-06-14,[''],Nice and easy good for beginners
760,2015-06-13,[''],quick easy and short. great for the little ones.
761,2015-06-12,['hiking'],"Hiked to Donut Falls Wednesday evening just after a rain storm.  The pine and aspen forests were wet and fresh and green.  Water over the falls was running heavy and made for a spectacular sight.  I think the trail descibed here starts from the main Millcreek Canyon road.  However, you can now drive to the trailhead parking lot, which makes the hike to the falls a 1.8 mile round trip.  The hike is very, very popular and the evening that I did it, parking was scarse and there were too many folks on the trail for my liking.  Otherwise it is a pleasant outing for all abilities."
762,2015-06-10,[''],"Loved this hike even though I didn't climb down the rocks just before the falls, i was wearing my son in a new frame backpack. Once I'm more comfortable with it, we'll try again!"
763,2015-06-09,['hiking'],"I would consider this a walk, not really a hike, unless you scramble up the falls.  The falls were nice and the upper parts were not very crowded, since people were afraid of getting their feet wet.  The water was definitely cold, but was a small price to pay for a better view.  The parking is very limited and they were handing out tickets like candy.  There are other falls that are almost as impressive without the huge crowds."
764,2015-06-09,['hiking'],"Even on a Monday evening, it was like Grand Central Station.  Totally packed at the trailhead and it seemed like every car had at least 4 people in it.  Large groups and some of them not all that courteous in terms of trail etiquette.

You can't get to the Donut yet, without getting your feet wet.  Maybe in a few weeks, but I'd skip this trail for now, unless you plan on getting there early in the morning or don't mind crowds."
765,2015-06-08,['hiking'],A short but really fun hike!
766,2015-06-08,['hiking'],Beautiful and easy hike. Good for little children.
767,2015-06-05,['hiking'],"Easy, short hike. I did it while 7 months pregnant, and had no problem. Wear shoes that can get wet, as crossing the water and climbing the waterfall is worth it."
768,2015-06-04,['hiking'],ME & my 8 month Pregnant wife went up and loved it super easy
769,2015-06-02,['hiking'],"An easy, short hike with a fun reward at the end.  Hikers can explore the river and climb up near the waterfall if you've got the right shoes on!  Would recommend for anyone!"
770,2015-06-02,['hiking'],"Made the mistake of Going on a
Saturday. It was like a super hwy!  Nice and easy Til the last but which requires crossing water cross covered rocks."
771,2015-05-30,[''],"Decent hike. A little busy. Rude hikers. Cool view of the ""donut"""
772,2015-05-27,['hiking'],LOVE this hike. Gorgeous hike & totally worth it. Gourgeous cave too! Definitely one of my favorites.
773,2015-05-25,['hiking'],"Quick easy trail, it can get pretty muddy and slippery when it's rained recently. I recommend wearing shoes or sandals that can get wet if you want to climb the up to the waterfall."
774,2015-05-25,[''],Fun hike. Bring some water resistant shoes to cross the streams.
775,2015-05-23,[''],"Fun & easy, it's a great hike if you're just looking for a short hike for the day."
776,2015-05-23,['hiking'],"Great hike, can get busy but still worth it, also a fun hike in the winter the trail gets packed down enough to the point you don't need snowshoes. And don't forget to actual check out the waterfall in the cave I missed it the first time because I didn't hike up the rocks."
777,2015-05-12,['hiking'],"Went up in March. There was tons of snow, but it was packed tight and our group with running shoes did just find with minimal slippage. It was a bit hazardous but a complete blast! The falls has way less water than when we went again in May. You have to walk a bit on a residential road through some cabins till you get to the actual trail but its not a problem. (Not sure when they actually open that gate).
This trail is very busy. Even at 10:00am on a random Tuesday we saw 20+ people. While everyone is generally courteous I prefer other trails where I can hear less talking from random highschoolers sluffing school."
778,2015-05-06,['hiking'],Lots of tight packed snow on the ground in March. Pleasant trail.
779,2015-05-04,['hiking'],"First time to hike this area.  It was my Birthday and I had heard a lot about it.  A very bust trail compared to what am use to, but a great one all the same."
780,2015-05-02,[''],Very fun short little hike. A decent rock scramble mixed w snow around the rocks this time  of year (early May)
781,2015-04-25,['hiking'],"Short, simple hike. Great for kids. The hike has a pretty view of Mt. Kessler, ends at the bottom of the rather small Donut Falls."
782,2015-04-19,['hiking'],"Ok. NO ONE told us that to see the actual ""Donut Falls"" of this hike, you have to scramble up a steep stream. Gah! Most of the families just had to sit at the bottom and enjoy the pretty view from there (you can't see the donut fall from there though). This is why we started a hiking site for families called Wanderookie. We test the trails ourselves then write posts with pics, trail details (parking, difficulty, crowds etc.) that will minimize surprises for families or rookie adventurers. The falls on this hike are truly unique and beautiful, but be prepared to scramble up the stream! We will be doing this hike with our alltrails hiking group (also on Facebook under Utah Hiking Group - Wanderookie) this summer! Find us and join! It will be a blast!"
783,2014-12-27,['hiking'],A short easy hike. Usually crowded. Much prefer the trail on the right that takes you further up the canyon.
784,2014-12-07,['hiking'],Nice easy hike and a beautiful waterfall at the end.  Too short and too easy to do again but enjoyed the scenery.
785,2014-10-06,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail to hike in October. The trail was not too busy as I started around 6:30pm, but there were a few people I crossed at different points. I went up and over where the falls are and was able to enjoy the sounds of the creek and falls alone. There is one split in the trail that is not well marked. Keep to the left to reach the falls."
786,2014-10-05,['hiking'],"This is a great simple Family hike. Although, as has been mentioned by many others it is extremely busy, we have completed a couple times (all on the weekend) and has always been very busy. We've found if you go up the backside coming out of the parking lot, it is prettier going along side the river and that section much less traveled."
787,2014-09-16,['hiking'],"This is a fun hike, but very crowded, especially on the weekends.  It kind of feels like you're in Disneyland instead of enjoying the quiet of nature."
788,2014-09-12,[''],Nice short easy hike for Adult but not for children.
789,2014-09-07,['hiking'],Not my favorite hike but it is an easy hike for adults. I wouldn't recommend taking any kids along esp right after winter because of the water run and how dangerous it can get with the rocks. Enjoyed climbing all the way up to the donut hole. It is a little crowded if you go during the noon hours but usually very quiet and serene when your the first ones there in the AM! I'd go again just for the fun of it.
790,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"definitely not recommended for children but as sisters going up to the top of the falls, was so beautiful! went inside and actually stood under the waterfall coming thru the hole, (donut falls) pretty freakin awesome! hiked this trail about 15 times this summer. EASY and WORTH IT!"
791,2014-09-01,[''],"Just went there on August 31st and with it being Labor Day, the trail up to donut falls was super busy. It was pretty though. At some point in the hike, there's different paths you can take, but they don't lead up to the falls. In my opinion though, taking the path(s) less traveled by(literally) was the best part. Definitely a lot longer of a hike as well as a steeper incline. There's pretty meadows along the way and if you walk further(if you take the right paths that is) you'll eventually end up in this really nice area to picnic as well as take pictures. Explore the different paths if you're looking for serenity and/or a longer, little bit more challenging hike because these other paths don't have a ton of people. Keep in mind though, again, these alternative paths won't lead up to the falls. At least, not that I know of."
792,2014-08-30,['hiking'],Excellent for taking small kids on a small adventure.  If you park up the road about a mile then the hike is less than 2 miles round-trip (this road is closed in the winter).  Parking at the upper trail head is very limited so some choose to park at the lower trail head.
793,2014-08-17,[''],Don't take your dog!  Got a nice ticket after the rangers chased us up.
794,2014-08-16,[''],"Extremely easy hike, but the falls are beautiful! Fun to do if you aren't looking for a serious workout."
795,2014-08-10,['hiking'],"We loved this hike(25 and 32 yr old women in shape with an awesome 9 yr old boy) There were tons of chipmunks on the trail and a moose was spotted off the trail not but 25 yards!! There were more people than I was hoping for on the trail but it's very popular and it was the weekend so I can't fault it for that... Just try to go on a weekday if possible. Hike was a breeze! Even if your not in shape, take your time and enjoy the scenery!"
796,2014-08-07,[''],"NO DOGS ALLOWED! We did not enjoy this hike. We drove all the way from Provo to do this hike not realizing that dogs are not allowed on this trail or anywhere in Big Cottonwood Canyon. The view of the falls was disappointing, hidden by an outcropping of rock that you had to climb to see around. Not possible with little kids. The walk was nice but also too crowded."
797,2014-08-03,['hiking'],"Short, fun hike to a pretty cool waterfall. The trail is pretty easy, but the last little bit is a challenge. In order to get to the doughnut portion of the falls you have to climb up some rocks. It is a little tricky and can get quite slick depending on the amount of water coming through the falls, but it was worth the climb. I wouldn't recommend that young kids try and make the climb."
798,2014-07-30,[''],"Fun trail.  I have done this many times, in winter and in summer.  Trail is fairly easy to follow, however, please use extreme caution when scrambling up the last bit to the cave itself.  This can be difficult for adults and ill advised for young children.  People get hurt here every year, some have been killed.  Use good judgement and have fun!

Pros:  Accessible, fun for kids (8 and up is OK, 7 and below, use caution) Interesting feature, north facing (not as hot) 
Cons: Incredibly popular, can be dangerous."
799,2014-07-28,['hiking'],"Great hike for the kids - relatively easy, not too long. Gets slippery at the falls but with care the kiddos made it across."
800,2014-07-26,[''],Love this hike. Generally see a moose. Not today but we will be back!
801,2014-07-26,[''],Completed Yesterday the 25th of July. Did not see a moose but the trail is beautiful. I hiked this trail a while back and saw a large bull. A great short easy trail.
802,2014-07-17,[''],"Super easy, short hike with a pretty waterfall at the end!"
803,2014-07-04,[''],"Fun and easy hike. Super kid friendly, wide and well marked trail, plenty of other hikers, and easy to finish in a couple hours. My son and I make it our inaugural hike every spring."
804,2014-06-28,['hiking'],"Love this easy hike. The falls are beautiful. Only downside is it can be a bit crowded. Have to get your feet wet to get near the falls. Can be slippery, be careful."
805,2014-06-23,['hiking'],"Enjoyable first hike of the season for me.  I have never been before, but have had it on my to do list for a while.  Finally went on 6/22 and found it a nice easy hike with very wide trails.  Very heavy traffic, and the miles zipped by quickly.  We did have to park down by the main road as parking can be limited at the trail head at times.  It adds a bit more to the hike but not bad.  I saw lots of toddlers and small children.  Seemed like a good family destination.  A word of caution when you are crossing the river near the top.  footing can be slipper in the water so watch the little ones, I was a little surprised to see babies and toddlers up past the river.  I managed to get across the river dry, my hiking partner not so well.  Fun, but expect to get wet especially if you go to the very top. Enjoy!"
806,2014-06-17,['hiking'],Super easy hike for any and all ages and activity levels. It's beautiful but there are always lots of people and the trail is not pet friendly.
807,2014-06-12,['hiking'],"Nice little hike.  Nothing terribly difficult.  The thing is, people feel compelled to climb the falls, which are very slippery.  Someone just died in a fall there a week ago.  It might seem harmless but beware.   Good for kids and adults alike, hardly any elevation gain.

There is a way to Cardiff Mines from this trail.  It's a few miles longer but well worth it.   Refer to your maps."
808,2014-06-12,[''],"Went yesterday. It wasn't packed but there was road construction driving up big cottonwood, so it took us about 40 extra minutes either direction. Also, my pedometer said it was about 1.7mi round trip. Easy and gorgeous, but not as long as I expected!"
809,2014-06-08,['hiking'],"Granted we did it on Memorial Day weekend, it was way too crowded for my taste-from the parking lot all the way to the falls, which we had to view from above because of the log-jam of people trying to get to the bottom of the falls. 

Also, the trail to the falls is not marked very well.  We ended up overshooting the falls and having to back-track to get back onto the trail.  While it was fun for my 6-year old daughter, having allTrails rate this as the best hike in Utah is not even close to accurate."
810,2014-06-04,['hiking'],Nice hike and beautiful scenery.  The water is a little too high right now.  I will go again in a couple weeks to hike up to the top.
811,2014-05-30,[''],My first hiking place nice went you get to the end and see water fall could not go up were the cave was but is okay I like the water fall
812,2014-05-27,[''],"Awesome waterfall, always packed with people and their kids."
813,2014-05-20,[''],I couldn't find it?
814,2014-05-04,['hiking'],There is still lots of snow in the first week of May though most of it was packed well enough to hike on. I went on a Friday around noon and the trail was fairly crowded.
815,2014-05-02,[''],"Just went today. I would describe it as more than a little bit of snow, but still a good hike. Definitely want to go back after the snow melts. Better in the summer."
816,2014-04-17,['hiking'],Still had a little snow on the ground but not to bad for hiking was fun little trail...
817,2014-04-17,['hiking'],My family and I have hiked here twice. It's a very pretty trail but it was crowded both times. People are usually polite on the trail but maybe hike it during the week if you want to take pics w/out strangers in them.
818,2014-03-30,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail today, still had snow on the ground, but it was not too slippery. Wonderful hike."
819,2013-12-02,['hiking'],"Fun hike. It's an easy hike, although me & my friend took a detour from the orginal trial (that's the adventurers in us I guess.) Lots of people travel this trail so if your looking to get away into the wood for peace and quite this wouldn't be the place. Fun overall the the trial has a waterfall &  cave both cool features to this easy hike."
820,2013-10-17,['hiking'],"Lots of fun, went with a church group to hike this trail. I would recommend it although it was a very crowded trail."
821,2013-10-06,['hiking'],Easy hike with little kids (all under 5).  Very crowded and not relaxing with all of the people on the trail- hence the 4/5.
822,2013-09-05,['hiking'],Did this again but climbed up rocks to Donut waterfall cave this time. Was really cool & worth the effort!!
823,2013-08-31,['hiking'],Super easy my kids all loved it. Ages 8-15 VERY pretty and peaceful we were on the trail by 8:00 In The morning so we had it pretty much to our selves. Coming back it was a different story tons of people ! Will do this one again for sure ! 
824,2013-08-23,['hiking'],"this is a great short hike with young kids.  My 5 and 3 year old walked it and I carried my 7 month old - just when the kids are about to melt down you come to the waterfall :)  we went on a week day, could see how it would be busy on a weekend, but worth it for a family looking for a short hike.  This hike offers a little climb and a good end so the kids feel accomplished."
825,2013-08-12,['hiking'],Nice hike when you don't have a lot of time
826,2013-08-08,['hiking'],"Easy hike after work. Not many folks on the trail in the evening. Beautiful, shady hike with lots of wildlife nearby. The falls are nice, but I would try to do this hike after the rain (a scarcity I know). "
827,2013-07-21,['hiking'],"The top of the trail is really beautiful, and it's about as easy as it gets for a hike but bring your patience. This place is REALLY CROWDED. I read the reviews and thought to myself, it couldn't be that bad.... It's that bad. If you have kids and you're looking for an easy hour or two outdoors, this place is for you. If you are looking for a quiet place to commune with nature, this is not it. Go somewhere else. "
828,2013-07-16,['hiking'],This was a great hike for my two boys ages 3 & 5. Too hard to climb up the falls part with them but I saw lots of adults doing it.
829,2013-07-09,['hiking'],"For fun times with the kids, we love this hike! We go every year and the kids love it. It's not steep at all, the walk in is fun, the kids love the bridge over the water.. and the fun little drop down right before getting to the water fall is ""so scary"" for the kids, yet they love it!    Don't park where it says, no parking, Everytime we go, we see the rangers giving tickets.  They patrol it like crazy.  Worth parking over by the main road and walking up the road to the trail head."
830,2013-07-06,['hiking'],Nice easy trail. Not very steep. To get to the waterfall / cave you have to climb up some rocks so some good sandals aren't a bad idea.
831,2013-07-06,['hiking'],"Drive south off of BCC road and save yourself a good half mile of hiking. 

Kids (11 & 9) LOVED the scrambling near the waterfall. "
832,2013-07-05,['hiking'],"There's a path you can take that'll lead you to an area where you can look at the top of the donut. Kinda cool, the view is nice too."
833,2013-07-03,['hiking'],Hiked to the falls with my two grandsons ages 6 and 10. The parking lot was full and the trail busy. Probably about a 100 people on the trail and at the falls on this day.  It has been decades since I have made this hike the the falls is not the same as there used to be more of a cave at the front of the falls. My grandsons had a ball and of course had to get wet which was the best part of the whole day. The trail is a gradual climb with a short climb down a 12 foot rock escarpment.
834,2013-07-01,['hiking'],"This trail is very easy but so amazing at the end! Why?! Cause its got a bomb cave with a waterfall that comes down into it, that's why! The climb up to the cave is sweet too. Great for kids to play in the creek and hang out. The cave is for older kids that can climb and not afraid of heights. Fun stuff!"
835,2013-06-28,['hiking'],"My 15 year old step-daughter and I took this hike and really enjoyed it. We took an accidental ""detour"" however by heading right at the fork instead of going left, so we ended up on a much longer and more difficult hike which we really enjoyed. We went back the other way to the falls on our way back and the falls were beautiful. Parking wasn't great, but I can see why this is such a heavily travelled hike. We look forward to going back!"
836,2013-06-21,['hiking'],Very cool hike up to this waterfall with the hole. Very congested with others and small children. Donut hole is worth seeing with a little extra effort and there is a small cave you can climb into to see the waterfall up close inside the cave.
837,2013-06-17,['hiking'],"This was our first time hiking up here, the water was really cold and there was still snow on the higher, shadier areas. It wasn't that bad of a hike, we were unprepared as well. We were in flip flops and still made it up this trail just fine. It is actually one of my favorite hikes now."
838,2013-06-13,['hiking'],"We did this hike today.  My 5 year old, who usually complains about hiking, hiked the entire way telling me what a fun hike it was.  Right now the river is low enough, the kids can play in it.  They loved it.  It was very crowded and that was on a wed. afternoon."
839,2013-06-12,['hiking'],Went during early March while there was still snow up there.  It was our first time hiking it and we were a little confused when the GPS ended on a giant hill with no waterfall in sight.  We could hear the fall though and hiked up the hill a little bit and realized we were actually on the waterfall.  There was an awesome cave like thing we were able to climb down into.  Beautiful hike and fairly easy.
840,2013-06-11,['hiking'],"Easy hike, great when time is limited or a group member needs a less strenuous climb. The views are spectacular no matter the time of year. If busy trails and crowded overlooks are not your thing, this is not the hike you're seeking."
841,2013-05-26,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail with my 6yo daughter and she loved it. It's short enough with not much elevation gain so she didn't need to stop and rest or be carried. The parking was pretty packed with a lot of people on the trail, but not too bad. We sat on a rock in the middle of the steam at the foot of the falls and ""caught"" Swedish fish. There was plenty of shade most of the trail so it was nice and cool and provided for some fun scenery. We didn't boulder up the falls. A little to dangerous for a tiny girl. All said and done, it was a fun little hike and will do it again and hopefully go to the top of the falls. "
842,2013-05-05,['hiking'],Fun quick hike but gets kinda crowded! There was snow on the trail today but since so many people come through the snow is packed down so it's still an easy trail. It's good for family and children because its not very steep. The waterfall and cave are awesome! :) 
843,2013-04-22,['hiking'],"Nice hike, but it gets very crowded."
844,2012-12-11,['hiking'],"great hike, pretty treacherous in winter right below the falls. a lot of ice covered boulders and such."
845,2012-11-10,['hiking'],jumping
846,2012-11-05,['hiking'],"Big cottonwood has a myriad of trails of all levels. Only downside of the canyon is no dogs are allowed ): 

Donut Falls is beautiful! Short and not challenging. We did climb up past the Falls and followed the stream a little bit, which was a fun adventure."
847,2012-10-02,['hiking'],"Nice short hike and well worth it.  Bring your camera. 
It's easy to miss the turn off back to the parking area but the main dirt road will take you back close enough to find it."
848,2012-09-15,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, fun climbing, and cool falls. Can get crowded by lunch time so go early. "
849,2012-09-14,['hiking'],"It's a great hike for small children I ended up going past the donut and there were several more little water falls very small it's a good little hike I would recommend it for dates and family's, if your looking for something advanced this one is definately not it. -kailor"
850,2012-08-24,['hiking'],"Great mini hike for kids and toddlers in carriages. I have biked the trail above Donut Hole Falls and it was a challenge for both me and my bike. Lots of carrying the bike around obstacles. 

But Donut Hole Falls is a wonderful place to relax."
851,2012-08-17,['hiking'],"Really neat waterfall at the end! There's a hole in the ceiling of a cave with the stream falling right through the hole making an awesome view! Make sure you go to the back portion of the cave and behind the falls, and take a picture. It's deep enough you'll get your pants wet up to your knees doing this, but the picture you'll get will be so worth it! (with the sun coming through the hole at the same time the water does!)

Not much of a hike, quite short and not very steep (until the very very end). However, right at the end you'll have to climb up a bunch of rock boulders, and in some places water running over them may make parts of it slippery, so it may not be a good idea to bring really young children."
852,2012-08-09,['hiking'],"Fun out and back trip with a great waterfall at the end, but very crowded."
853,2012-08-06,['hiking'],"The waterfall is beautiful! It's a quick easy hike, great for families. I recently moved out here and took my family there when they visited. I've been back there 2x on days off when I was bored. On weekends the falls are packed with people, I'd recommend hiking it during the week if possible. "
854,2012-08-03,['hiking'],This is a short and sweet waterfall. Everyone of all ages can do this hike. There are more waterfalls and picture taking views if you climb the boulders which is a bit more strenuous. You may also take a dirt trail uphill which is on the side of the bushes. The day I came was super busy (Saturday). It is best to park outside of the trail and walk about a half mile in. There's also tons of potholes and a big dip to be careful of if u decide to drive in and look for parking. 
855,2012-08-01,['hiking'],Love the falls on this short hike 
856,2012-07-18,['hiking'],"Very easy hike for all ages.  Even though the grotto/cavern partially collapsed a few years ago, it is still possible to hike up the face of the waterfall and see the water cascade into the donut hole.  If you stay below, you'll miss the view."
857,2012-07-02,['hiking'],nice
858,2012-06-23,['hiking'],Easy hike and good for the family. 
859,2012-06-20,['hiking'],"I agree with Angie, the falls are just ordinary now. 

It is a pleasant hike and well worth taking the kids. 

Parking lot was overflowing for a Tuesday morning! Quite a few folks on the trail, but spread out. Several were climbing up the boulders to see the Donut Hole."
860,2012-06-09,['snowshoeing'],"Nice trail year round. We went snowshoeing. There are better hiking trails up SLC's canyons, but if you have the time Donut Falls is definitely worth it. "
861,2012-04-11,['hiking'],Nice all ages trail year round. 
862,2012-03-08,['nature trips'],great trail good for young familes  nice views
863,2012-02-17,['hiking'],Great fun for kids. Nice hike. Lots of photo opportunities. Parking can be a pain at peak times.
864,2012-01-09,['hiking'],"Nice short hike.  North face of the canyon, so it stay pleasant most of the year.  Fun hike for small children, but watch them carefully near the falls."
865,2012-01-05,['hiking'],"Yeah, was actually able to hike in today due to the lack of snow right now up the canyon. I did have to hike in from the main road because the road to the trailhead is closed for the winter. Once I got to the falls area there was ice there so be careful. Also had to climb down a little ledge that was very slick so be ready for that if you go up soon. But it was a fun little January hike that probably normally wouldn't happen. "
866,2011-10-24,['hiking'],This was a great hike with lots of opportunities for pictures. I'm a little out of shape so this was a nice starting hike. The first little bit is pretty uphill and can be tough if altitude affects you or you have asthma but it gets a lot easier after the first hill. You should be fine if you don't have trouble breathing normally. The falls are also definitely worth the little hike!
867,2011-10-14,['hiking'],"Great for families, however the final climb up to the falls can be difficult.  If you can make it up the climb at the end it is well worth it."
868,2011-10-10,['hiking'],"Went with lots of family members.  Was a great trip for the age range we had with us (12 to 71).  Ate some snacks at the base of the falls.  There were lots of people there.  Didn't climb to the doughnut due to the group ages.

Came here a year ago June with my daughters and it was less crowded, but snow covered half the ground.  We were not prepared.  Also, the run-off was so strong we couldn't really see the doughnut area."
869,2011-09-07,['hiking'],"what a great, quick hike! Easy slopes leading up to the falls then some fun scrambling to get to the falls itself. I only wish we could bring our dog on this hike. "
870,2011-08-02,['hiking'],"Hard to believe this little gem is just 30 mins drive from SLC. Easy & fun, and gorgeous now with all the wildflowers blooming."
871,2011-07-14,['hiking'],We really love this hike to get away from the valley on the hot days of summer.  It is an excellent trail to bring kids on and we really like to bring friends from out of town to show them our beautiful mountains.  Make sure to pack a lunch and spend some time along the trail and enjoy just how pretty it is up here.  
872,2011-06-24,['hiking'],"Great trail for the kids. Still a little snow and mud in places but nothing horrible. The river was high and fast so we had to hold our kids on the bridge crossing but other than that the trail keeps a good distance from the river. The shade in the canyon was a nice break from the 90+ degree weather in the valley. We'll take our kids again. Kids are 5 and 3 and they did the while thing on their own which was nice, usually we end up carrying them. "
873,2011-05-18,['hiking'],"I love this hike it's so beautiful up there and it's great for all skill levels to hike, my four year old almost made it the whole way.  At the end there is a nice waterfall that falls through a hole in a rock hence the name donut falls. "
874,2011-04-21,['hiking'],Nice easy hike. Good for all members of the family
875,2011-04-14,['hiking'],Nice little walk to a medium/smaller size water fall. But with it being so close to everyday life its a good quick get away. 
876,2010-09-10,['hiking'],I took my 8-year-old daughter on this little stroll. It was a delightful walk completely within her ability range. The creek and the lush mountain vegetation made the walk very pleasant. A great way to expose little ones to the joys of hiking.
