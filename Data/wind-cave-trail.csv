0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],This hike is pretty easy. I would recommend it to those who are just getting in to hiking. It’s a nice mix of steep and flat. Not too bad at all with awesome views of Logan canyon and those caves! They’re so cool!
1,2019-09-05,"['hiking', 'no shade']","Hiked this trail most recently 9/2/19. The trail is very exposed, without much shade, so it’s probably best hiked in the morning or evening. Bring plenty of water. Great hike in the fall, when the maple leaves turn. The view from the caves is spectacular. "
2,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'no shade']",there are lots of areas without shade so this one is probably better for a morning or evening hike. the cave is really cool but it's not deep so no need for jackets.  I took this trail on with my 5 & 6 year olds and it was probably at the limit of their ability. overall a great hike with loads of fantastic views and a really cool cave/arch at the end.
3,2019-08-28,['hiking'],Great trail for a quick hike. Lots of sun exposure.  Caves are pretty cool.
4,2019-08-25,['hiking'],I found it harder than most folks told us but it was still do-able with breaks. we also haven't fully acclimated to the elevation. The wind caves really are beautiful and truly frame the canyon. very worth the effort!
5,2019-08-23,['hiking'],Worth it. So many different things to see. Absolutely breathtaking with moderate effort.
6,2019-08-17,['hiking'],This hike was definitely worth the view! My little dog was quite the trooper and seemed to enjoy it just as much as I did. I would recommend to go in the morning rather the afternoon. Less traffic and cooler weather! 
7,2019-08-15,['hiking'],"great hike.  beautiful views and caves.
"
8,2019-08-13,['hiking'],Awesome trail for most skill levels. Saw some kids who were able to do it in sandals. Did see a very large rattlesnake so be aware! 
9,2019-08-09,['hiking'],"the hike was awesome! beautiful views and the cave was amazing!
"
10,2019-08-03,['hiking'],"Loved this hike! We hit the trail about 7:30 a.m. as to beat the heat and the crowds. Took us about 50 minutes to reach the caves. There are some steep places, but not too bad. Loved the view of The China Wall once we reached the caves! B-E-A-UTIFUL!!"
11,2019-08-03,['hiking'],The cave formations are awesome! 
12,2019-07-22,['hiking'],Love the wind caves but it’s always busy! Go early!
13,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"Great trail, not too steep but still challenging in hot temperature.

Bring lots of water.  There is only ONE water source within the first mile of the trail.  Although, there are a few shady spots where you can rest on the way.

Very beautiful view on top of the cave!  Great picture spot !"
14,2019-07-18,['hiking'],the view from the caves is gorgeous! Do this early!  The snakes started coming out at 10 am. We saw 4 within five minutes coming back down. 
15,2019-07-13,"['hiking', 'no shade']",Excellent views worth the effort.. 
16,2019-07-12,['hiking'],The hike Took us about 2 hour there and back but we took lots of water breaks! Trail was easy to follow but quite a bit of people for a Friday morning! We started our hike at 7 am and thank god we did because it would have been hot any later. The wind caves were really cool and was worth the hike! 
17,2019-07-09,['hiking'],"If you are visiting with a friend in Logan, Utah you got to hike the Logan Trail Caves! It is a climb and has many switch-backs but when you get to the top the wind caves and views are amazing! I would recommend hiking in the morning or the evening because there isn’t a lot of shade and less people on the trail I would also recommend bringing at least 1.5liters of water and a couple snacks. Have fun and enjoy the view!

18,2019-07-08,['hiking'],Loved the view the entire way! and the clean air was a plus. Got it done in 2 hours total up and down. Great place to set personal goals. make sure to take plenty of water and some snacks
19,2019-07-04,['hiking'],"Loved the trail! it was beautiful all the way up and down. The only hard thing is I have a pup who LOVES to say ""hi"" to everyone and the trails are pretty thin. But we loved it overall."
20,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"Hiked this 4mil with kids (6,8,10) and thought it was a pretty moderate hike for them. Most of the trail was in the sun but there were quite a few spots in shade, which was a welcome treat. Arrived at 9 and there were about 8 cars parked, when we reached the caves there was only 2 other families there and they left shortly after.
The views were gorgeous and the caves were neat, especially for Northern Utah. All of the kids really enjoyed climbing and playing in them."
21,2019-07-02,"['hiking', 'bugs']","In town from Seattle and wanted to get in a great workout. We’re used to a big finish with mountains, lakes or rivers in the PNW and figured the caves would be right up there. The hike itself was really hard and I’m pretty fit. The caves were neat I suppose but nothing close to how much effort we put into getting there. "
22,2019-06-30,['hiking'],good trail. not the trail I would recommend if you are looking for your own private trail. lots of people hike here. Still has great scenery and is well maintained.
23,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
24,2019-06-28,['hiking'],"Very popular hike and it’s an easy one for kids, the view once you reach the wind caves are amazing, highly recommend for families "
25,2019-06-28,"['hiking', 'no shade']","My dad and I hiked this trail at the end of June. The side that’s hiked up is a fairly steep grade and is open to the sun. The caves at the top are kind of cool. The first one is right under the submit and the second is around the corner of the first. Super heavily trafficked. We got there at 9 am, but wish we would’ve gone earlier to beat the crowds. I’d say it’s fairly unique at the top, but other places in Utah have more to offer."
26,2019-06-28,['hiking'],great trail
27,2019-06-17,['hiking'],"It's a great, basic trail for all ages! It's a favorite of ours."
28,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Nice views but the trail is too busy. It’s the most popular destination for local families with children so avoid it if you’re looking for a quiet hike in wilderness!
29,2019-06-17,['hiking'],My kids (3-13) loved it! I did have to carry the 3 year old for about half of it. Two hours of hiking total and 45 minute break for dinner at the top! 
30,2019-06-12,['hiking'],hiked with family. 11 yr olds - this was the extent of their limit. great views. caves are amazing. crowded trail. well marked trail for early June. 
31,2019-06-10,['hiking'],"GORGEOUS hike. You will have incredible, breathtaking views all throughout this hike, especially at the end. The caves and the view is so rewarding. The hike was fairly easy. My husband and I took our two kids ( 10 months and 7) and our dog. I carried my 10 month old. Pretty good amount of shade and sun. Weather was perfect! A bit cool with a nice breeze. Take sunscreen, I'm burnt. One of many of my favorite hikes!"
32,2019-06-07,['hiking'],"Very great trail. Description is accurate. Lots of people for sure, but a beautiful overlook/caves at the top"
33,2019-05-30,['hiking'],Was a great hike with some amazing views both at the top and along the way!
34,2019-05-27,['hiking'],Awesome hike! Great views and cool caves at the end! 
35,2019-05-27,[''],"Beautiful hike. Make sure to stick to the trail, we decided to try an off the path detour (BIG mistake) ended up practically rock climbing down then back up to find the trail again. We were lucky to see some deer which was pretty awesome. Definitely an uphill hike, but well worth it."
36,2019-05-27,['hiking'],Took my two young boys on this hike. They loved it! 
37,2019-05-26,['hiking'],"We loved this trail. Bring water and a hat. The caves at the end are worth it! Plenty of signage, including signs saying to stay on the trail...three groups we ran into must not have understood what that meant. I had two boys who wanted to explore off path so I get it, but had to reign them in and follow the rules. When under the cave, follow the cave wall around to the left, there is another big cliffside cave."
38,2019-05-25,['hiking'],Love it!
39,2019-05-12,['hiking'],"My family went on this trail today for the very first time. We arrived just after ten and the parking area was already full, we lucked out and got a spot. The trail itself just goes up and up and up with switchbacks. There were some shaded areas in the beginning of the hike, but less so as we got higher up the mountain. This trail had tons of activity, mainly college students, and everyone was friendly and courteous. When we reached the Wind cave it was nice and cool inside with a great breeze blowing through. Some spots of the trail had some larger drop offs, so be cautious if hiking with smaller kids, as well as inside the cave with the smaller loose rocks. The entire hike round trip was 4.42 miles according to our Endomondo apps. Highly recommend, just come early, bring sufficient water, and enjoy the amazing views!"
40,2019-05-11,['hiking'],Great place to take puppy and kids. We has a family had a blast. Great view and other hikers were very kind to our slow group. Haha
41,2019-05-06,['hiking'],"Beautiful views. Definitely an early morning hike, starts to get busy after noon."
42,2019-05-05,['hiking'],This trail has been a favorite for over 20 years. I hike it with a weighted pack to train for longer backpacking trips.
43,2019-05-01,[''],great view from the top !
44,2019-04-17,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Pretty easy trail, there was a lot of snow and mud but it made it all the more fun! The view from the top was amazing"
45,2019-04-07,"['hiking', 'muddy']","My first Utah trail...I enjoyed it although I was probably expecting more from the Wind caves at the top.  Scenery was great.  The definition of moderate fades in a couple of spots but overall, a casual hike."
46,2019-04-04,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Still a bit muddy/snowy at the top as of April 1st. Totally doable though!
47,2019-04-01,[''],Really muddy still. alot of steep parts but cool caves at the end.
48,2019-03-18,['hiking'],This was a great hike with awesome views of the canyon!  Some of the hike is a little rough but if you take it slow you will be fine.
49,2019-02-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful views of Logan Canyon from step one with the money shot at the top. It was a pleasing hike some steep areas with mud, but they call that hiking! Strongly recommended for a great day hike!"
50,2019-01-28,[''],great trail. wonderful view. hiked it in January with snow and it was a little slick but it wasnt bad. totally doable.
51,2019-01-26,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",
52,2019-01-25,[''],Great trail with many amazing views of the canyon.  The Wind Caves themselves are pretty awesome and are deserving of a little exploring.
53,2018-12-02,[''],One of the most beautiful trails I have been on. Highly recommend. I wouldn't recommend taking small children.
54,2018-11-22,['hiking'],"Great for a quick mid morning hike. 
Up and back is about a 1.5 hrs.
Love the view from the cave."
55,2018-10-21,['hiking'],"5 stars, this trail was breathtaking.  Fall colors were glorious and getting to the caves at sunset with no other people there, to die for.  Amazing.  Will do again."
56,2018-10-09,['hiking'],"I've wanted to do this one for a while, and finally made it up today with a few friends. The trail is relatively steep, but well marked. I really enjoyed the hike; one of the best in northern Utah in my opinion. A brisk fall day might have contributed to how much I enjoyed it, because we had the cave all to ourselves."
57,2018-10-07,[''],"Fun, easy hike. Took me 45 minutes to reach the cave.  October 6,2018.  Not too difficult,  beautiful weather."
58,2018-10-03,[''],Great quick hike. Beautiful views.
59,2018-10-01,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! Nice breeze and sounds of birds the whole way. The colors of the leafs are so brilliant right now! The cave at the end is a treat! Highly recommend. Not too steep !
60,2018-09-24,[''],"I went with three other friends early in the morning 9am this fall (totally recommend going in the fall). We stopped a lot for pictures and to catch our breath. (One has asthma). But we still made it up to the Caves in an hour and 45 mins. When we got there, the Caves were underneath so we climbed down to them and it was fantastic! We ate lunch there and it was wonderful weather, once in a while a big gust blows at you but not like you’re going to be pushed around. As a group, we went around the cave to find another one next to it. Be careful, even with good shoes it’s very slippery (dry). We decided to go down what looked like a trial and it lead us back to the original trail. Warning, about 2/3 there’s a fork in the trail. Left side is a very steep cliff that’s about a 9ft drop. It’s manageable if you have people around you. The right also has a small drop and it’s manageable for one person. Over all, the whole adventure took about 4 hours. I’d totally do this again(even going through the steep trail). Makes great memories with friends! Also, I’m not an experienced hiker. I’m mediocre at best. Have fun!"
61,2018-09-23,[''],very cool and worth the effort
62,2018-09-17,['hiking'],great views and great experience
63,2018-09-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. Loved the caves, and view of the canyon.  Didn’t love hearing the vehicles on the road for the first half mile up.  Good climb up for sure but Kids did a great job, and so did we. Got started late on the hike so it was very hot with A lot of hikers. Would recommend starting early in the day and going in the fall for sure."
64,2018-08-26,['hiking'],"Fantastic hike to kill a few hours. Gorgeous views of Logan Canyon with a really fun cave at the end. If you are lucky enough to be there in early autumn when the leaves have changed it is truly breathtaking. It's a very popular hike, so if solitude is what you're after this is not the place to find it. Unfortunately, some idiots have graffitied numerous spots on the trail which detracts from the beauty. Please be respectful of nature and other hikers by leaving your ridiculous love declarations and hashtags where they belong. Hint: Not here."
65,2018-08-22,['hiking'],"Fun, quick hike for an afternoon or evening that will get the blood pumping and the sweat dripping! Great hike for the whole fam!"
66,2018-08-17,[''],Definitely a strenuous hike for unconditioned bodies! Well trafficked area with lots of people on the trail. Dogs allowed which is nice. Available parking close to entrance during the week. Lots of kids. Good warm up hike for the newly adventurous.
67,2018-07-29,['hiking'],"Our family has completed this hike three times now, most recently was September 2017. Our 9, 8 and 6 year-olds did well. Our 4-year-old had to be carried quite a bit. We took our time to enjoy the views etc. This hike is best enjoyed in fall, imho. The top does make me a little nervous with the children."
68,2018-07-28,[''],"Hiked this trail again on Wednesday for probably my 25th time.  I’ve lost count.  Had a great time.  It’s dry, bit we saw a few people we knew also out enjoying this trail.  Great for kids 10 and older because the caves at the end have drop offs that little ones might be a little scared of.

You get a great view of the China Wall portion of the Crimson Trail on the other side of Logan Canyon.

Worth it every time and would definitely recommend this trail if you are in the area and want a good hike that will take about 4 total hours from downtown to the top and back to downtown."
69,2018-07-23,[''],beautiful
70,2018-07-20,['hiking'],"A definite uphill battle to get there, but it had its gorgeous spots, especially the caves. My 4 year old had a tough time and had to be carried."
71,2018-07-16,[''],So . . . cave is a understatement more like wind blown hole in the side of a mountain. It is a steep trail. Also this is the only trail I have ever got a tick on. Lower ankle (lucky) stuck in hair.
72,2018-07-12,[''],This is a great hike for the family. Not too difficult and some cool caves at the end.
73,2018-07-10,[''],Great trail but it's pretty difficult! it's totally worth the challenge!
74,2018-07-09,['hiking'],Beautiful views at the top.
75,2018-07-08,[''],Great hike to bring the kids on.  Make sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen as much of the trail is not shaded.
76,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"This is a fine hike. Not hard, small incline and your at a few formed arches and caves. I can see some marking this as a 5 star, then coming back and making it a 2 or 3 as they experience better hikes. A lot of locals seem to do this as it is easy and popular."
77,2018-07-04,['hiking'],Beautiful views and worth doing in different seasons.
78,2018-06-26,[''],Great hike for the family. My four year old little girl was able to make it to the caves so that might give you an idea of the difficulty.
79,2018-06-16,[''],This hike is pretty steep in a lot of places so it's harder on the knees. There isn't a lot of shade. I feel like there are way better hikes up the Logan Canyon.
80,2018-06-16,['hiking'],Great view for a slightly under moderate hike.
81,2018-06-15,['hiking'],Beautiful trail...great views...enjoyed this nice break from our drive from Montana to Moab.
82,2018-06-13,[''],"It's a hot hike. take water, keep and eye on the kids. Beautiful though"
83,2018-06-10,[''],Great trail and the view is worth the hike. I took my 9year old boys & they had a great time. I was a little nervous at the top because it has a sharp cliff in the caves. Just watch your kids carefully at the top!
84,2018-06-10,['hiking'],It is easy hike if you are hiking every week. No sport shoes please take your hiking shoes or boots. It is hot between 12pm and 5pm during summer months.
85,2018-06-10,['hiking'],Loved this hike! We went in the late afternoon to evening and it was really nice.. not too hot and good shade areas. The cave at the end was awesome so bring cameras.
86,2018-06-06,['hiking'],"Went barefoot, it hurt. But well worth it...I think"
87,2018-06-02,[''],Absolutely beautiful end. Worth every step.
88,2018-05-31,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. Saw a baby rattlesnake on the trail, so keep watch. Didn't seem too far to the top and the views were excellent from the top and also along the switchbacks during the ascent. Would definitely do this one again."
89,2018-05-27,[''],The views were beautiful the whole way and the cave at the end was fantastic! Watch out for snakes though!
90,2018-05-20,[''],A good hike for most age groups. I frequently see young children on the trail as well as elderly couples. Take your time and enjoy the sights! Beautiful ending with the wind cave.
91,2018-05-16,['hiking'],"This is one of the best Logan hikes.  Although every time I hike it, it doesn't feel worth it until near the end.  Great views.  Should be called wind arch trail.  Can be busy.  Best times to hike are early summer and when the fall colors are prime."
92,2018-04-27,['hiking'],This hike kicked my butt (I’m not an active hiker) but it was well worth it. The view is absolutely beautiful!
93,2018-04-24,[''],"Is very scenic and awesome to climb with friends ...but climb with caution , very steep hill sides"
94,2018-04-21,['hiking'],"Did not have to walk in the water in the first 10 minutes. 
No snow on 4/20/18, a slight breeze, very pleasant weather! I suggest you start at least mid day, that way the wind cave wont be in the shadow of the hill its on. Better lighting for better pictures. This is a unique, natural formation; it is a nice reward for the hike. 
This is very doable, don't let the elevation gain per mile scare you off. We saw parents with kids and a dog, old people trail running, and some parents packing a baby up. This is great for anyone. If I lived in Logan, I would be here quite a bit."
95,2018-04-20,[''],Beautiful hike and the caves are amazing. So cool with great views.
96,2018-04-04,['hiking'],"Written from inside the cave.

Up here in the wind caves, if you sit inside, it's like you’re sitting in a big ear. You sit and listen with more power than normal human hearing because the rock interior gathers a large quantity of sound and funnels it down toward you.You hear the hum of the valley. Mostly the hum of humans. An airplane up overhead, a semi truck on the highway far below. But overall the sound that you hear is the wind... and the water; the forces that created these strange rock formations and this valley. You’re reminded that while humans are a force, nature is a much more powerful force. Out here you feel like just another living thing among the living things. You feel small.Your wants and worries feel insignificant. All you need is food, water, and shelter. You don’t hear people clamoring for an iPhone X or a new pair of Jordans. You don’t hear people moving to an affluent neighborhood or networking. You don't hear the ""ding!"" of a notification on your phone. You don’t hear people stunting on one another. A mountain lion could remove you from this life in the next twenty minutes. You’re listening for his silent footsteps through the brush. There isn’t time to dwell on much of anything. There’s only time to feel the rawness and realness of being just a human."
97,2018-04-02,[''],What a great hike! Beautiful scenery all around.
98,2018-04-02,[''],"Good hike, but not really too pretty. I’m sure in the fall it would be more beautiful."
99,2018-04-01,['hiking'],Good leg burner to start the Spring with.
100,2018-03-12,[''],"Hiked this on the morning of March 3 after a decent snow shower the night before. My husband and I had microspikes but you could probably make it up with just decent hiking shoes.  The sky threatened more snow, but the dry weather held out."
101,2018-02-11,[''],"Very pretty! This hike will get you breathing, but it’s not hard. Mostly dry, but there was a bit of mud towards the top. The cave itself kind of freaked me out with how slanted it was. 

My Strava recording said it was 4.0 miles, 1204 elevation and it took 1 hour 23 mins."
102,2018-02-11,['hiking'],"We hiked this trail the other day. It was beautiful, especially in this unusually warm weather we’ve been having. Very little mud. Definitely worth it. We took our roommates’ pup and he had a blast!"
103,2018-02-04,[''],Very pretty cave. Somewhat steep but not hard.
104,2018-01-21,['hiking'],"I liked the hike and the views... the ""lunch cave"" was warm and had a great view. The trail was busy and full of mud, slush, packed ice and snow. I'm way out of shape and it took me longer than most up and down but I enjoyed it. Thought it was only 3.5 miles round trip... I was fooled! I seemed to be the only one falling. I'd still do it again only in dryer conditions... or more frozen."
105,2018-01-15,['hiking'],"While the elevation is a lot, the grade I felt wasn't as steep as some of the trails we have done near Salt Lake City. It seemed to be more gradual... I enjoyed this hike and would do it again! We went on a Saturday afternoon, Jan 13.. temperatures were in the 40s... the trail was moderately crowded.. we saw about 6 other parties going up and down. The trail was muddy, slushy, icy and slippery in places, so our microspikes did come in handy! We heard there are often rattlesnakes spotted on this trail, though we did not see any. I don't know if they tend to come out more in the summer.... 

Note: our stats were 4.4 miles, 1,280 ft elevation. This is in comparison to the alltrails stats of 3.5 miles, 1,000 ft elevation."
106,2018-01-15,[''],Steep
107,2017-12-19,[''],Hiked it today little bit of snow/ice on trail. No problem with trackes. Nice hike moderately steep.
108,2017-10-12,[''],Did this hike on the drive from Salt Lake to Jackson. Well worth the stop! Pretty cool cave to check out at the top.
109,2017-10-08,[''],Fall colors are awesome right now!
110,2017-09-27,['hiking'],"Awesome spot! Gotta put in the work for that awesome view, by it's totally worth it."
111,2017-09-27,[''],Great view. Very popular lots of college students
112,2017-09-25,[''],
113,2017-09-18,['hiking'],"Definitely a work out in the first 2 miles. I unfortunately had to turn back because my dog got too tired. However, it was a well kept trail with a decent but not over-abundant amount of traffic."
114,2017-09-13,[''],"Did this hike in the winter, an amazing view"
115,2017-09-12,[''],Worth the climb
116,2017-09-05,[''],A lot steeper then our normal hikes.  My 7 yr old only made it with a lot of stops and a lot of encouragement.  Teenagers made the t with no problem.  Great view from the caves.
117,2017-09-05,[''],good trail.
118,2017-08-30,[''],Went for class. It was a blast. But it was steep. That's the hardest part. I took a lot of breaks along the way. It took me two hours to get up there and one hour to go down. But when you get to the caves it's worth it!
119,2017-08-26,[''],I would rate this trail at the low end of moderate. The caves were interesting. If you are looking for a pretty hike with shade this is not for you!
120,2017-08-23,[''],me and my little dog did the trail it took us a while but I am an extremely heavy woman. but we did it it was absolutely breathtaking
121,2017-08-21,[''],Amazing!!! Loved the whole thing! View at the top is spectacular! ❤️
122,2017-08-19,[''],This northeasterner was a bit winded at the high elevation but so worth it.
123,2017-08-16,[''],We did this hike in late spring when there was still some snow on the ground. There were long switchbacks and it was slippery and narrow in a few places. The wind caves were breathtaking.
124,2017-07-28,[''],"Fun summer hike, with some shade. Our active kids 5 and 7 did great."
125,2017-07-25,['hiking'],"If you're looking for a moderate hike with a great destination, this is it! It can be fairly busy, so the earlier you go the better. The spring time can be fairly muddy. Bring plenty of water for the switchbacks. The trail is always clear and trimmed."
126,2017-07-12,['hiking'],Great hike. It was just right for my wife and I. Going in the morning made for perfect temperatures. Love the views!
127,2017-07-09,[''],Love this trail. I was able to complete it while still moderately out of shape and the end was so worth it!!!
128,2017-07-09,[''],"Loved it! Great view, majestic surroundings!"
129,2017-07-07,['hiking'],"Started around 8am and saw very few people on the way up! Got there with the cave to ourselves. Not too steep on the way up, but most of it is in the sun so I'm glad we went earlier. Took some sick pics, explored a bit, then made our way back down."
130,2017-07-07,[''],"This is a moderate hike and doesn't take long to get to the caves. Has some pretty good views at the top, too!"
131,2017-07-04,[''],"We did this hike at about 6:30 PM, and it was perfect! During the middle of the day, it's almost completely exploded and SO hot! I'd suggest doing it in the evening. Beautiful views, though!"
132,2017-07-03,['hiking'],The views on the hike are very pretty.  It is a narrow trail so be prepared to have to scoot to the side to pass around others.  You definitely don't want to do this one on a hot day during the day.  It is mostly exposed and there was no breeze when we went yesterday.  We ended up turning around about 3/4 of the way up because we started to get heat exhaustion and ran out of water.  Will complete this one another (cooler) day.
133,2017-06-30,['hiking'],Great Hike!!! Amazing view! Bring a camera!!
134,2017-06-25,['hiking'],"It's a little closer to 4 miles. Great quick hike, very popular spot and the caves are fun."
135,2017-06-23,['hiking'],"Super easy, pretty uphill so that would explain the moderate rating. Fun to run back down, if you watch out for the few roots over the trail and go when there aren't many people. Definitely the most popular hike in Logan. But I've done it real quick after dinner and made it down before dark. Been several times, seen a harmless snake once."
136,2017-06-19,['hiking'],"Would do this again tomorrow.  Steep but sweet views most of the way & very green.  The ""caves"" at the top are picturesque"
137,2017-06-18,[''],"Wonderful hike! Beautiful views along the way. A lot of the trail is unshaded, so go in the morning to beat the heat."
138,2017-06-12,[''],This was a great trail to go on with little kids. There was 3 adults and 3 children (two four year olds and a seven year old) plus our little dog. They all did amazing. It had beautiful views and the cave was just gorgeous. The kids really enjoyed it. Highly trafficked but well worth it in our view.
139,2017-06-11,[''],"Great hike! However, we took our 7 and 9 year old boys and it was pretty difficult for them. There were a lot of narrow steep trails. There were many hikers that would not move to the side or thank you when you let them pass as we did!Manners are free!"
140,2017-06-05,[''],"Loved this hike. Beautiful scenery, views, not too many people for a Sunday."
141,2017-06-01,['hiking'],"This was a cool but short little hike. There were a couple other people at the caves when we got there but it wasn't too crowded. I could see it getting pretty packed though. Still, it's a nice hike and there are beautiful views in the canyon."
142,2017-05-29,[''],"Fun, fast, and beautiful"
143,2017-05-22,[''],Great hike! Great to do once or twice a year. Highly trafficked!!
144,2017-05-20,['hiking'],Such a fun trail. Moderate hike up with varying grades but always a view take in while you take a break. The caves at the top are so cool to see and a great place to snap a pic. I jogged the trail down back to the trailhead and was not disappointed!
145,2017-05-14,[''],"Great hike! There is a nice view the whole way up & the yellow wildflowers and butterflies are beautiful. There are rattlesnakes near the trail, so be careful. We had to wait while one crossed over the trail. It was scary! The caves at the end are totally worth it though. So beautiful!"
146,2017-05-14,[''],"Although it snows on us today and slightly rained, the views were worth it!"
147,2017-04-27,['hiking'],It was beautiful still a little muddy in some places but you should be fine it gets a little cold at the top so a light jacket will do
148,2017-04-20,[''],"Good hike, trail highly used go early."
149,2017-02-27,['hiking'],A good hike to do with kids and a good hike to do once.
150,2017-02-04,[''],better at night
151,2016-10-23,[''],"Nice hike--up in 40mins, down in 35. Great for beginners with many rewarding views. Caves are cool and the grade can feel rather steep at parts. Only giving this 4 stars because the brevity of the hike attracts a lot of people and the trail is rather narrow in places making bottlenecks and cramped passing."
152,2016-10-10,[''],"This is one of My Favorite hikes , it's a very easy hike up and back with a great end game . 
I enjoy watching the sunset on this hike .. Remember to hydrate .."
153,2016-10-08,[''],Dont do this at night unless youre a more experienced hiker or youre familiar with the trail!!
154,2016-09-25,[''],"It took my sister and I 45 minutes up, 35 down! Amazing view!!"
155,2016-09-25,[''],The trail is moderate and I agree. It has quite the ascent in the 1.8 miles it takes to get up to the cave but was easy enough for my younger daughter to hike without any difficulty. The views were beautiful especially with the leaves starting to change. It was a nice short hike. With children it took up about 1 hour to go up and 40 minutes to go down.
156,2016-09-18,['hiking'],A beautiful hike with the leaves turning. Not too difficult with wonderful views. A good trail for younger children.
157,2016-09-03,['hiking'],"This trail was marked as moderate. I would rate it at least moderate high. This is not a trail for the inexperienced hiker. It is quite an uphill climb for most of the hike. This definitely gets you up in altitude! The terrain is fairly rugged. Easy enough to navigate and kinda fun, but the higher you go and the narrower the trail,the scarier it can be. You are literally enveloped by mountains on every side. Definitely a beautiful climb but the climb is so strenuous that you may tend to miss the beauty around you."
158,2016-08-25,['hiking'],"Got up early and hiked this trail starting at 6am. I used a head lamp for the first 20 minutes or so. I got to the caves in about 45 minutes and was breathing heavy as I live at about sea level. I spent about a half hour at the caves and watched the sun rise, very beautiful! Would definitely do this trail again early in the morning as it got quite busy on my way down."
159,2016-08-23,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery
160,2016-08-14,[''],Great hike. But don't take young children on this hike. The 1.8 miles uphill is difficult and when you get to the caves there is a down slope with loose gravel. Very dangerous for children. But great views and the caves are worth the trek.
161,2016-08-06,[''],Just did this yesterday! Awesome hike. Not too long  and a nice steady incline. Also the canes at the end have some amazing views. Recommend it heavily as Logan canyon is gorgeous and seeing t from the caves is a great experience. Will do again!
162,2016-08-01,['hiking'],"The parking lot was full but I found that there is plenty of parking along side the road . 
The trail was easy to follow and in great condition . 
There were lots of other people on this trail 
So even hiking alone like I do it felt like you were hiking with a friend . Bring plenty of water and snacks .  
This is a great trail for small children to go on .  
Just stay on the trail  follow the signs and you too will arrive at the Wind Caves , truly amazing .
I enjoyed this trail rating it in my top 10 of favorite trails . It is 1.8 miles one way .. I hiked it in 1 hour 38 minutes up & back .. Happy Trails"
163,2016-07-30,[''],We like this trail a lot. We have done it in the spring and fall.  We are doing it again the first week of August.  The wind caves at the end are awesome!!
164,2016-07-25,[''],worth the views in the end!
165,2016-07-20,['hiking'],Wind caves were very pretty and worth the hike in the end. I didn't like how there was so many rocks on the trail but it is nature 
166,2016-07-19,['hiking'],Pretty nice quick and easy hike.
167,2016-07-02,[''],"Not my favorite hike, love the wind caves, but getting there is pretty hot so make sure you go early morning or in the evening."
168,2016-07-01,['hiking'],One of the best hikes here! Always busy so plan on going early in the day if you want some alone time with the mountain!
169,2016-06-27,['hiking'],"Pretty easy hike, with a beautiful view at the end."
170,2016-06-16,['hiking'],I hiked this trail a couple of years ago when my kids were young.  They enjoyed the hike and the cave.  On the way back they ran up ahead a few hundred yards and then came running back saying they saw a snake.  Sure enough a huge rattlesnake was working its way off the trail.  The trail is a great one for kids.  Just keep them close by.
171,2016-06-13,['hiking'],"I do this hike every year. One of my favorites. It's fairly short but a good climb with rewarding views. Bring water! I recommend starting early when it's not too hot, because the trail, being on the north side of canyon, is in the sun all day and gets really hot! Especially as summer goes on. Great view of the China Wall across the canyon (Crimson Trail)."
172,2016-06-10,[''],I love this trail!!!! It's a little bit of a workout but man is it worth the trip! The wind caves are beautiful!!!! I will do it time and time again!
173,2016-06-09,['hiking'],Fairly easy hike with a considerable amount of elevation gain. Can get quite warm / hot as the majority of the trail is exposed to direct sunlight. Lots of switchbacks and should be good even for a fair novice hiker if you take enough water and rest along the way.
174,2016-06-06,[''],"One of our favorites whenever we visit Cache Valley. Kids love it and it is a pretty easy hike with a lot of switch Backs. The views at the top are gorgeous. Better earlier in the day, there is not a lot of shade on the trail."
175,2016-06-03,['hiking'],This hike was fun! Gorgeous view! It was a medium Level hike but a good challenge at the same time. It's a narrow trail so go in the morning or evening.
176,2016-06-02,['hiking'],"Fun, easy to moderate hike with great scenery. We hiked this last night and it was really pretty. Trail is not very wide in most places. I would suggest going in the evening or early in the morning as this hike can get very crowded. I would avoid this hike on Saturday's because it will get crowded and you will have to wait a few times due to the narrow trail. Hike is well worth it."
177,2016-05-30,['hiking'],It's not too long but it's a good incline whole way. 1000ft elevation gain makes it a good challenge
178,2016-05-20,[''],Amazing views!
179,2016-05-18,[''],"Trail is amazing! It's not for beginners, it does have some height to it.. So don't listen to these ""SO CALLED HIKERS"" who says it's easy and ""ANYONE"" could do it..if you are in okay shape you should be fine. BUT! If you don't hike much this probably wouldn't be a hike for you.. 

The view is spectacular! Beware lots of douche bags live in that area so be cautious about them.."
180,2016-05-16,['hiking'],"It's a great workout.  I've lived in Logan most my life and have never done this trail.  I went to ""run"" it and that didn't pan out well.  1000 feet of elevation gain to the caves is intense.  Perhaps if you are in pinnacle shape, but even just hiking gives a killer calf workout.  Some parts of the trail are in bad repair and rutty/rocky, and some parts are very narrow so watch it.  As stated, there isn't much cover, I got cooked pretty good in my 2 hour in-and-out.  I ran back down and it was pretty fun.  Gorgeous view."
181,2016-05-14,['hiking'],Great hike! The cave was nice and cool on a hot day.
182,2016-05-12,[''],"I love this hike for something fairly short, but great views. It does not have much shade so try a cooler day."
183,2016-05-03,[''],"One of my favorites! I love having a destination on my hike! We went on a week day, not many people at all so that was nice. I recommend doing this in the spring or fall when it's cool... Not a lot of shade cover and i read you need lots of water on this trail, but we each had three small bottles this time of the year and it was perfect. Gorgeous views, and the caves AMAZING!!"
184,2016-04-30,[''],"Excellent hike. The first mile and a half is pretty much uphill, but the views from the caves are worth it."
185,2016-04-23,[''],One of my favorites
186,2016-04-14,['hiking'],"This is worth the drive up to Logan Canyon if one is from Salt Lake.
Around the 5740 elevation level there is a side trail that goes up to the ridge.  On the ridge one can continue on over or go up the ridge."
187,2016-04-10,[''],So fun! And so worth it!
188,2016-04-03,['hiking'],Awesome hike!  Broke a little sweat on this cool Sunday morning in early April.  Beautiful views of the valley!
189,2016-03-20,['hiking'],This was a very fun trail! My family and I went in March. There was still some snow on the ground and one part of the path was very narrow and slippery. We also can across a lot of mud and slipped a few times. We would definitely recommend hiking boots. Many part of the trail that get narrow which might make it difficult for smaller children. The view as you walk to trail is beautiful! The cave is very fun but slants down a bit. Overall we loved it! Has a amazing view from the top making the hike worth it. Make sure to bring extra water.
190,2016-03-08,['hiking'],So great.  I love the view from the caves!! Bring water!
191,2015-09-10,['hiking'],"Great hike, highly recommend. Everyone does it around here but the trails aren't usually bombarded with people. Great view- can't wait for the leaves to change!"
192,2015-09-06,[''],Great trail. I was on the trail by 7am and watched the sunrise up over the entire canyon. I wouldn't take small children on this hike as it's pretty steep in some places. The wind caves are awesome and are a perfect place to enjoy a snack before you head back down. Bring plenty of water.
193,2015-09-06,[''],Hike in the evening when there is a full moon! Start about 8:30 pm and watch the moon come up. It lights up the whole trail. Fantastic!
194,2015-08-23,[''],"As someone who seldom hikes, it was a great hike. The distance isn't too far as at its steepest it's not too bad. The smoke from the wild fires didn't allow the views that people rave about, but not much you can do about that!"
195,2015-08-14,[''],Great trail.
196,2015-08-12,['hiking'],Amazing view!  Moderately difficult but has shade along lots of the path.  Trail is clearly marked and the view in the caves are spectacular!
197,2015-07-26,[''],Amazing views!!! Well worth it!!!
198,2015-07-10,['hiking'],Awesome hike and beautiful at the top but should not be rated easy. We took kids and it was very challenging for them. Also I wore my Garmin watch and it was 5 miles round trip.
199,2015-07-05,[''],"It was a pretty joke, but holy cow, don't go during the hot part of the day! It's pretty steep and there are hardly any trees anywhere to stop for shade. The reward (the caves) was not worth the sweat."
200,2015-06-28,[''],Great hike.  A little scary at the top but I'm kind of queezy when it comes to cliffs.
201,2015-06-22,['hiking'],"Great hike with plenty of shade along the trail to take a drink or quick break. The view is spectacular from the cave. Traffic is moderate, but the trail is narrow at some points making passing more difficult. This is one of my favorite hikes around Cache Valley."
202,2015-06-21,['hiking'],"This is the iconic hike in Logan. Pictures at the top on every basic Logan white girl's Instagram.  I let that keep me from checking it out for a long time, thinking it would be full of people all the time. I was happily disappointed! The hike is steep for the first half, but once you get up above the rock cliffs it's a nice stroll with breathtaking views. Not one to try in flip flops. Trail is narrow and the vegetation will brush your legs on the way up."
203,2015-06-02,['hiking'],"Favorite hike in northern Utah!  It's steep and long enough to make you feel like you're getting a good workout, but not enough to make you feel miserable.  The end view is definitely worth the climb!  Would recommend to anyone!"
204,2015-06-01,['hiking'],"This hike has beautiful views of the canyon. It is fairly strenuous as it is uphill most of the way via switch backs but there are plenty of areas to rest in the shade. While I was unable to record the hike due to no cell service, I felt that it was longer than 1.7 miles to the caves. My personal pedometer said about 2.3 miles to the caves so a total of 4.6 miles but that is not the most accurate reading. Regardless, the hike was great and I would recommend it to anyone in the area."
205,2015-05-31,['hiking'],"Decent hike. Great reward at the end. It'll test your endurance if your not in good shape. Not recommended for younger than five year old kids as the first part you need to have semi sure footing. 

I don't understand the description where it says the first part you have to wade through water. I've never had to do that. Don't let that deter you."
206,2015-05-28,['walking'],"This is a fun hike to a popular geological feature. It is moderate, but accessible to many."
207,2015-05-26,['hiking'],Fun hike and kid friendly.
208,2015-04-13,['hiking'],"I have hiked this trail numerous times. It's a classic. There are quite a few switch backs, but they are long enough that it doesn't feel monotonous. I haven't ever had to walk in water like the overview (above) says, but at some times of the year there is still a little snow near the trail towards the top, it's not bad tho. Pretty view, make sure to go down underneath inside the wind caves as well as taking in the view from on top."
209,2015-03-25,[''],"I'm an impatient hiker, prefer off trail hiking so that's exactly what I did on This trail. Beat my friends who took the trail by 30 minutes. But oh man the view and solitude up there is amazing! Took the trial back down and it's pretty steep so make sure you're wearing better than average shoes."
210,2015-02-07,['hiking'],I've been walking this trail since I was a kid. Fun family/group/date activity. Amazing to do at midnight with a full moon!
211,2015-01-20,['hiking'],Moderately steep hike. Great views of the other side of the canyon. Caves are interesting and great place for lunch.
212,2014-10-05,['hiking'],"Completed this Hike in August, had to attempt two days in a row due to getting caught in Thunderstorm. It was a great hike, loved the rock formations up top, although I don't know you can really call them caves."
213,2014-08-12,['hiking'],Went on this hike with troop 108 from honeysuckle. it w as d awesome. great views. we started together but split into 2 groups I es d eith the firdt group took abot 55 mins to get to the caves. we did a bit of jogging up. second group about 20 mins later. The cool thing was mr and 3 scouts jogged all the way down and did it in 30 mins. That was a challenge for them but they made it.  Great hike for the family.
214,2014-08-03,['hiking'],"Steep hike, hot in the summer so bring lots of water."
215,2014-06-16,[''],I am out of shape. The steepness kicked my butt.  I had to stop tp caych my breath several times. It was all worth it!
216,2014-06-08,['hiking'],"Steep uphill, with some shade.  Lovely view at the top.  My 8 yr old climbed it no problem, but my 5 yr old struggled and had to be carried part of the way."
217,2014-05-24,[''],"I love this trail! It's challenging to run, but amazingly fun!!"
218,2014-05-05,['hiking'],"I did this trail in July.... but while I was on the trail, I was caught in a thunderstorm. By the time I was at the top, I was soaking wet, but had a blast. The trail is technically fairly short, but it's almost straight up the mountainside -- very steep -- but worth the view once you get up there. The clouds and rains made the view even more beautiful. While the most popular part of the trail stops at the wind cave. After the cave, if you've got time, about halfway back down, take 'Wind Cave Way"" and head up the ridge to Beirdneau Peak or even over to Green Valley."
219,2013-09-22,['hiking'],"We went as a larger group- 3 adults and 6 children (ranging from 5 - 9 years old). It was quite steep climb at times, but they didn't last long. Lots of sun, with a few small shady areas to rest. It's a quick climb for the relatively short hike. We went a little slower for the kids, but they were troopers. Even had a couple face-plants, but I guess they're tougher for it. The view at the top was amazing and worth it. Be sure when you get to the top that you keep a close eye on your kids, as there is a BIG drop off at the front of the cave (you enter from the back). What a view! Awesome! Bring lots of water and sunscreen! Will definitely like to do this hike again. "
220,2013-07-24,['hiking'],This was a fun hike.  Took my 82 year old father and we took our time.  the views were great and the arches were very cool.  I would rate this as moderate to hard due to the lose terrain.   This is a very good day hike.
221,2013-05-31,['hiking'],"Good trail, a decent hike; can't wait to see the colors in the fall. "
222,2013-04-09,['hiking'],"I had a great time on this trail.  The trail is very used and well maintained.  It was raining on the day I visited and the trail does get extremely slick.  Which isn't too much of a problem until you get closer to the cave area.  This a great trail for all it is a elevation gain of 900' but it is a gradual and plety of areas to stop and take a rest or even grab a bite to eat.  The views of course are amazing, after all this is Logan Canyon.  A favorite for me, this would be a great one for all those trail runners out there.
"
223,2012-08-26,['hiking'],great little hike that everyone in cache valley should do at least once.
224,2012-07-23,['hiking'],"Good trail as long as you start early during the summertime.  The wind caves were very pretty and we actually walked on top of them without realizing it, at first.  Worth the trip! "
225,2012-06-28,['hiking'],"Trail wasn't too hard.  I had blisters when I was done, but it was from poor fitting hiking boots.  Cave isn't really a cave, more a short tunnel or archway.  It was rather steep and had a severe drop off and I wouldn't let my kids play in it when we got there."
226,2012-05-06,['hiking'],"Great shorter hike. No water on trail this year. It's a nice short hike, with a fun cave at the end. "
227,2012-04-02,['hiking'],"Nice hike, not to difficult, great scenery. I would suggest going in the fall when the leaves are changing. Great autumn colors and the temperature is a little cooler. Water and trail mix is not a bad idea."
228,2012-03-19,['hiking'],its not really what i would call a cave but it is worth seeing. not to difficult.
