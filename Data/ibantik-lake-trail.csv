1,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"Quite moderate. Went in August, parking at trail head was sparing. The farther you go past Wall Lake the less hikers you will encounter, although each lake I passed had 2-3 backpackers camping.Still an awesome hike regardless."
2,2019-08-21,['hiking'],"Definitely a moderate hike. Amount of other hiker/people starts to clear out after Wall Lake. Noticed quite a few flies while hiking and some mosquitos, but not horrible. "
3,2019-08-18,['hiking'],Started on a mid-August Sunday at 10:15am. Parking lot was full by then. Trail difficulty is accurately rated at moderate. Well-maintained all the way to the lake. Saw a lot of backpackers leaving on the way there but very few on the way back until the saddle viewpoint. No bug issues.
4,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"Excellent and well marked trail. We hiked in toward Meadows lake, camped overnight and then back out. Plenty of amazing views and opportunities to enjoy nature. The trails were pretty crowded on Friday up until the notch, then they thinned out further on.  We didn't really have many bugs while hiking, but when we stopped to setup camp, they descended upon us.
I highly recommend it and look forward to doing it again sometime. "
5,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"Great trail, Lake Ibantik underwhelming. lakes just prior were arguably nicer. Good weather, clear night sky until very bright moon rise."
6,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"Fantastic trail! We just did this as a day hike. The trailhead was so crowded that we had to park at Trial Lake and hike to Wall Lake, but from there we followed the Notch Trail to Ibantik. Everything was beautiful, weather was great, almost no mosquitoes. In all we were close to 10 miles with the extra bit from Trial Lake. Highly recommend this trail!"
7,2019-08-15,['hiking'],Beautiful hike!!  Many ponds and lakes. Closer to 8.5 miles in total distance. 
8,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"The title of this hike should be Just Wow! We loved it. Not many mosquito’s, didn’t even use spray. Passed 24 lakes in total with the Clyde lake loop added in. Wildflowers were the best we had seen so far this year. We clocked 9.6 miles with adding the loop. "
9,2019-08-06,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
10,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Definitely longer than 7.7 miles round trip. Several in our group had devices recording distance and we all recorded about 11.5 miles. Otherwise, absolutely beautiful trail. The wildflowers were amazing."
11,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"Hiked on 7/20/19. Beautiful hike. As others have mentioned, this is probably closer to 9 miles round trip, but still isn’t super strenuous. Started the hike by Trail Lake instead, but both parking lots were pretty full. The initial part of the trail was pretty busy up until Wall Lake and then it thinned out. Once you get to the top of the notch it seemed to get less busy too. A lot of people with camping gear were on the trail, and the lake area on the other side of the notch had some nice camping spots scattered around. Only did this as a day hike though which was still pretty mild. Definitely buggy this time of the year. Good mix of shade and sun through the hike as well. One of my favorites so far in the Uintas."
12,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'rocky']",Trail is in good shape. Lots of mosquitos as expected. We clocked in at right around 9 miles today. AllTrails tracker doesn’t follow the actual trail.
13,2019-07-20,"['backpacking', 'bugs']","Overall decent trail that is pretty easy even with a heavy backpack.  We went to this lake and ended up camping at meadow lake 1.4 miles further from Ibantik.  Trailhead parking lot was insanely busy, and I’m not sure what time you would need to get there to ensure not having to park in the overflow parking area.  Trail is very crowded at first as well (with large Boy Scout groups), but it thins out the further you go.  The bugs (mosquitoes and gnats) are horrible right now...bug spray helped with the mosquitoes but did nothing for the gnats."
14,2019-07-19,['backpacking'],"Me and my brother did this as an overnight backpacking trip. It was amazing! The stars were beautiful. We didn't see any mountain goats or really any wildlife accept for salamanders is some of the ponds on the way up. The trail is pretty easy going. The only challenge for us was ""The Notch"" This is the highest point of the hike so it's going up on the way there and going up on the way back. There are camping spots and fire pits throughout the area. The best ones are across the dam on the the other side of the lake. There is a small waterfall and fun boulders to climb on as well. Highly Recommend you check it out! "
15,2019-07-15,['hiking'],We hiked this as a loop — Clyde Lake to Notch to Ibantik back to Notch down to Wall Lake.  Trail is in great condition although a little wet heading down from Notch to Ibantik.   Gorgeous views the entire route.   Don’t forget the bug spray—swarms of mosquitos in places.     We logged a total of 9+ miles.    
16,2018-08-28,['backpacking'],"Very beautiful trail the whole way. I'm no bird expert but the back half of the trail seems to have more than usual bird nests, so if you're into that, this might be a good place!
This is perfect for a quick overnighter with no planning, or a first time backpacking trip, or even one to take the younglings with. It is a little bit of a climb to get over the notch both ways, but definitely not bad. The great thing is, there are several bodies of water along the way that you could stop at if your legs got too tired and just set up camp there. The parking lot does get full, so get there early (or late) to get into that parking lot.
There are two trailheads that I saw from the parking lot, one that is big and welcoming, and the other that you want to go on is hidden behind cars. If it wasn't for the AllTrails app I would have kept going for a while longer haha. Get on the trail that says Wall Lake.
The trail is well maintained and easy to stay on, even when the trail disappears, people have lined rocks up to form a trail over the boulders. Very hard to get lost once you're on the trail.
The lake is fairly small, but very pretty being nestled next to a big cliff mountain. There will be a lot of other campers with you there. The best camping spots are on the east side of the lake in the trees. Much better for hammocks, and there is actually firewood over there. No fire for me on the rocky west side haha.
Very fun overnighter, will do again next year."
17,2018-08-12,['nature trips'],What a great hike for a beginner backpacker. It’s just enough to challenge you. Just got back today on August 12th.
18,2018-08-12,[''],"Hey everyone! First off, this was a beautiful hike! We backpacked in, and it was a great overnight trip. It wasn’t too steep, and the dogs loved it as well. 

The parking lot fills up quick! If you don’t get there at 5:00 A.M, you could be looking at an extra mile from where you have to park. (Unless you are a rebel and have no problem getting a ticket for parking where it clearly says you cannot. 

There were no signs leaving from Washington Lake. If it wasn’t for the All Trails app, I would have been really confused on where to go. So make sure to open up that little map All Trails has to offer. 

iPhone users beware, if you hit the directions option from your all trails app, it WILL lead you to a different parking lot! Open up the actual map all trails provides, click on the little arrow to the bottom left, and actually follow your phones directions to the correct parking to get to the trailhead. And as I said before, there were no signs, it actually says there are two different lakes that you’ll be hiking past."
19,2018-07-26,[''],"loved this hike. not too steep either way, great views of lakes, cliffs and rocks. We just hiked to Ibantic lake and back. the parking lot was overflowing and rude people parked by the no parking signs along the road, which blocked traffic. we parked in the overflow parking about a half mile away with no problem."
20,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful hike that has a lot of beautiful vistas, lakes, meadows and forests. Fairly busy but not bad. We hiked only as far as the pass and didn’t go down to Ibantik Lake."
21,2018-07-22,['backpacking'],Great trail!  Tons of lakes and lots of wild life. BE ADVISED the mileage on all trails is way off. My Garmin read 9.5 miles round trip instead of 6.4. Elevation is accurate.
22,2018-07-14,['backpacking'],"Hiked in on July 5th with my kids for one night. Hike wasn’t bad. The only challenging part was going over the pass and it wasn’t hard at all. Fishing wasn’t great. Caught one fish on a worm. 9 mountain goats walked through our camp. 6-7 awesome camping spots and a few more that are decent. By evening most were occupied. Two streams feed into the lake on both sides of the lake. Plenty of firewood within 80 yards of the bank. Breeze blows from the West most of the day and stops a little after sundown. Mosquitos weren’t bad, but we wore 100% Deet.. Perfect first back packing trip for my 4 kids (18, 16, 14, 11). Views are spectacular. Water is so clear.  Would definitely go again."
23,2018-07-09,['hiking'],Worth the trip. Not the best fishing but a great view!
24,2018-07-09,['hiking'],"Very pretty! Went and the parking lot was very crowded, the trail became less crowded the further in we hiked. Lots of dogs on and off leash. Bugs weren’t bad, but they were out."
25,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"Great hike! We did an overnighter and backpacked in, but this would be a great day hike. There were several lakes along the way, possible to go to further lakes, caught several fish, several water locations to filter, fair amount of shade on the first half, and even saw mountain goats on the west side. 

Difficulty: 5/10. 
Length was 6.5 miles. 
Traffic: Mild/moderate on this trail but the parking lot was a joke.
Tips: Fish at Meadow Lake, fly and bubble or golden Jake’s worked well."
26,2018-06-24,['backpacking'],Loved it. Amazing scenery. Great for beginner backpackers like me. Camped one night and didn’t get too cold-40’s. My doggo was in heaven.
27,2018-06-24,['backpacking'],"I’m new to this app can anyone help me out. When it says the distance is 6.4 miles and then it says in and out, does that mean 6.4 round trip? Or just their is no other access out? And it’s 12.8 total?   Thank you anyone that can help me out.  Also is their any good spots to fill up your water jug with the water tabs?"
28,2018-06-14,['hiking'],"Beautiful!  All the way!  So many lakes along the trail from the Crystal Lake TH, with mountain views.  As of 6/12/18 there was one snow patch just below the notch, then 80% snow or water down to Lavona Lake.  Otherwise simply beautiful!"
29,2018-06-14,['backpacking'],Hiked and set up camp the night of June 12. Amazing stars and not too cold. Trout made it their life goal to taunt me by revealing their colored scales but not bite. Amazing views and saw only 6 other people camping there but it was very isolated. No mountain goats :(
30,2018-05-27,['backpacking'],"Backpacked past Ibantik and in to Meadow Lake at the beginning of August last year. Views from The Notch were amazing! Moderate hike with a few steep places but totally manageable. Wind was a bit fierce on day 2 but other than that, a great trip. Bring your fly rod."
31,2018-05-16,['backpacking'],"Did this hike last August. Stayed 3 nights perfect weather. Hiked in on a Monday passed a few people leaving but only had neighbors one night. A few groups hiked by. Hiked to Meadows lake one day, beautiful had the lake to ourselves all day. Based on the reviews planned on a lot of mosquitoes didn’t get a single bite. Also didn’t get a lot of bites from the fish. Hiked the meadows lake for the day. A few mountain goats did pass right by our camp."
32,2018-05-06,[''],"Did this hike 2 years ago at the end of June. Still some snow in places on the trail. A few steep places going in and coming out. Fortunately, that keeps traffic at the lake to a minimum. Slept in hammocks at the lake a couple nights. Caught lots of fish and woke up to mountain goats in our campsite every morning. There’s a lot of dead trees which made it interesting sleeping in hammocks, especially with the nightly storms. Writing this review as I get ready for another trip here this summer."
33,2017-09-19,['fishing'],Caught 6 trout on a fly with bubble and 2 with powerbait. Great spot.
34,2017-08-20,['backpacking'],This lake is absolutely beautiful as well as the entire hike.  There are many great views. The weather was great. It does get cold at night so a jacket is recommended even in the summer.  We had a mountain goat come right through our camp and hang around for quite awhile.  On the hike back the next day there were eight mountain goats climbing across a ledge and we were able to watch the young ones jumping back and forth amount the rocks and gaps. I highly recommend this trail. My eight year old daughter was even able to hike the whole thing.
35,2017-08-17,['backpacking'],"Great hike! Many lakes and wildflowers. We saw 3 adult mountain goats and 3 babies(kids) right by our camp site. Got really cold at night. 
Hike was mainly hard towards the end getting to the notch then hiking down to Ibantik."
36,2017-08-06,[''],Did this hike 8/3-8/5 stayed one day at ibantik and fished great hike in east to find and follow trail.
37,2017-08-05,['backpacking'],"Awesome and very eventful 2 day backpacking trip. We started out Saturday morning at Crystal Lake Trailhead. 4.1 miles to Ibantik. So many pretty wildflowers and lakes on the way. The trail itself was easy to hike. The notch was the hardest part, steady incline for awhile, gorgeous at the top, then a beautiful decline on the other side. We passed some groups on the way there, some with horses. 

At Ibantik, only a few parties were camped out there. We had a really close encounter with a family of 6 goats.  We were sitting by the water looking for them up on the mountain, and we turned around and they had completely invaded our campsite!! I was a little nervous but they were peaceful.  We got to jump in the lake a couple times, and headed back out Sunday morning. Great trip. 10/10 would do it again."
38,2017-08-01,['hiking'],"Did this hike on 7/31/17. I started at the ibantik lake trail head where the crystal lake parking lot is. The trail itself wasn’t bad at all. The hardest part was getting up the notch, but even then I didn’t find it that difficult. The views from the notch are awesome! Ibantik lake was surprisingly crowded tho. On my way back I ended up taking the Clyde lake trail so it looped around and ended back at the crystal lake trailhead. This is a great hike if you wanted a quick day hike or a long one you can spread it it as fast or as long as you’d like. A bunch of different lakes to explore and check out."
39,2017-07-25,['backpacking'],This is a really beautiful and easy backpacking trip. It is about 4m one way in to Ibantik. It has become very crowded over the last couple of years. Get there early to pick a good spot.
40,2017-07-24,[''],"Scenic hike. The first mile is pretty mellow and then the climb is pretty constant. The lake was super crowded, 30ish people or so and everyone was within 50 feet of each other. Bugs were moderate and went dormant during the night."
41,2017-07-13,['backpacking'],The bugs near Meadow lake were HORRIBLE! Bring a Thermacell even if you have to sell your car to get one. Such a beautiful area and the hike is only challenging near the notch.
42,2017-07-12,['trail running'],Two words: BUG SPRAY.  Trail is extremely crowded until you get up past the Notch.  Then the number of people thins out drastically.  There is still some snow on the downward trail after the notch so watch for the switchbacks to stay on the trail.  SUPER runnable.  Went all the way up to Meadow Lake/Seymour Lake for a total 12 mile round trip.
43,2017-07-04,['backpacking'],Beautiful hike. Loved the cliffs. Not too crowded. There was still quite a bit of snow on the trail on the Ibantik side of Notch. Fishing was spotty. Great overnight backpack trip. We plan to do it again.
44,2017-06-18,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! So many ponds and lakes. The kids loved it. 70% of the trail was covered in snow but we were able to still find our way.
45,2017-05-29,[''],Beautiful! The best part is hiking around to the nearby lakes after you reach Ibantik. We staged a car higher up on the road so we could hike a different route out; I highly suggest it!
46,2016-09-20,['backpacking'],"Beautiful trail, passing several lakes along the way. Moderately busy, but definitely worth it."
47,2016-09-19,['backpacking'],"Camped down by Wall lake and fished one of the smaller lakes, and no bites.  Probably fished pretty hard there. Went up to Ibantik and on to Seymour Meadow Lake.  The fishing at Meadow lake was lights out.  Every cast was a bite.  At Ibantik there were mountain goat hanging out on the cliffs.  Was well worth the hike up"
48,2016-09-12,['hiking'],Started late on Sunday to avoid crowds. Beautiful scenery. Too many cows in the meadows. Easy hike with beautiful scenery. Worth it to take a light rod for some catch and release. Plenty of wildlife along the way. Nothing difficult on the trail. Trail is golden as it gets close to dusk.
49,2016-08-17,['backpacking'],"This was a fun trail that was a pretty good length and difficulty for most backpackers. My GPS recorded just over 4 miles one way to ibantik lake. It was pretty full so I set up camp just above the lake under the boulderous mountains, about .5 away. the next day I hiked to meadow lake, which was about 1.5 away from ibantik. I highly suggest setting that lake. its less busy and very beautiful, the main difference was the mountains were a little further from the lake, but still visible. It would have been nice to camp there, but there weren't many flat spots. Setting up a hammock was prime."
50,2016-08-06,['backpacking'],Fun trail for a quick overnight trip. Perfect for any age group and worth the view at the end. When we were there the fish really weren't biting but it was a fun trip either way.
51,2016-07-22,['camping'],"A hidden gem nestled atop the mountains.  I originally planned to hike up to Seymour Meadow Lake from the trailhead near Trial Lake but as soon as I came upon Ibantik I knew this is where I was going to be staying for the night.  This little lake is a must see for anyone wanting to go hike through the Uintahs and at 10,200 feet, it truly feels like you're on the top of the world. Fishing wasn't the best but I did catch a tasty little 10 inch Brook Trout."
52,2016-07-07,['hiking'],A great hike. This one really has a little of everything in it and there's beauty in literally every direction. A must!
53,2016-07-06,[''],Stunning. We took our 2 dogs and lost count of how many lakes we passed on our way to Ibantik lake (maybe 8 or more lakes).  The first 2.5 miles is uphill until you reach the saddle and then the last 1.5 miles is downhill all the way to lake. My garmin watch clocked 4.25 miles one way. Bring plenty of bug spray because that is the only negative thing about this hike. We camped at the lake and there are plenty of spots. We even woke up to a heard of 10+ mountain goats!!!!
54,2016-06-26,['hiking'],"Great trip, a Uintah classic."
55,2016-06-20,['camping'],"Fantastic hike.  The Notch still had some snow and parts of the trail were buried, sometimes for several hundred feet making it a bit difficult to get down the far side. The lake was beautiful and it was much warmer than we were expecting for so early in the season. The lower lakes seemed to have much more ice on them then the higher ones."
56,2015-08-06,['hiking'],"Our family loved this trail (our 4 kids, ages 12, 11, 9, and 6 did awesome). We made  a loop by starting at the Crystal Lake trailhead, hiking to Wall Lake, Lovenia Lake, Bench Lake, Notch Lake, then from the Bald Mountain TH my husband hitch hiked back to Crystal Lake to get our truck. We saw 7 adults and 4 baby mountain goats at the top of Notch Pass. So cool! We camped on the west side of Ibantik Lake and I can't stop raving about how beautiful it was. We had done a loop near Big Elk Lake in July and were eaten alive by mosquitoes. This time around we literally only saw one of those awful blood suckers. That could be due to the season/temperature or the fact that we soaked our clothes in diluted Permethrin before this trip. We did this trip in two days/one night bad highly recommend it."
57,2014-07-30,[''],"Ibantik is a great destination lake, or as a stop along a larger route.  Campsites are good on the west and east sides of the lake. Nestled in an alpine cirque providing a classic Uinta backdrop.  The fishing is decent though not phenomenal. The hike is not terrible at all.  The pass through the ""notch"" though uphill is easily gained and not a long affair. The hike back down into Ibantik is pleasant.  A bit large by Uinta standards (though smaller than several in the area) Ibantik is not as quaint, however, the cirque of looming peaks behind Notch Mountain do a lot to make the lake feel farther away than it really is."
58,2013-07-21,['hiking'],"Day hiked this trail with my Son-in-law on Saturday. Because we didn't have a lot of time we hiked fast and completed the round trip in less that 2.5 hours. We saw Mountain Goats at ""The Notch"" and was told by a ranger that there is a herd of 22 that hangs around the pass. The trail was mostly very good and was rocky only in a few places, There are parts of the trail that are still muddy and there was a trail crew moving a wet part of the trail to a new location on the North side of the pass. We saw 5 or 6 campsites on the lake so it appears to be heavily used."
59,2009-07-04,[''],"The trail itself is awesome, but this guide describes the trail incorrectly. It describes going past Lovenia Lake 1.6 miles to the notch in Notch Mountain. Lovenia Lake isn't reached until after you go through the notch. I felt the guide was also too brief in it's description. It would have helped to have had a landmark pointed out along the way to the notch, such as Hope Lake with it's easily recognizable rock wall, so you know roughly where you're at, as most of the lakes in this area are unmarked. The hike itself is fairly easy until you hit the switchbacks going up Notch Mountain and start gaining elevation. The scenery is beautiful and you get to see plenty of lakes along the way, so it's definitely worth doing. We went on the 4th of July and there was still snow along the trail and a large cap of snow on the notch that we had to hike through, so I would say that this hike is probably best to take in the peak of summer."
