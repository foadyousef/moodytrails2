1,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'scramble']","If you want any type of shade or view of waterfall/ the stream don’t do this trail.. at the fork where the paved road meets the dirt take a right and follow till you get to the parking lot. THAT is where you will find the waterfall, shade, the stream etc. this was also pretty strenuous, it had steep drop off also so if you have kids i would be cautious doing this route! The other access to the waterfall is much more family friendly and enjoyable! "
2,2019-06-22,['hiking'],"The trail meets with another trail that starts on the other side of the canyon.  The other trail is easier- has shade - is more beautiful- and has parking.  This trail is steep, no shade, and you get a view of the waterfall that you should be next to if you had taken the correct trail.  After 2.5 miles you are nowhere near the final waterfall- in fact you have 1 more like to go beyond where this trail says the final destination is.  There is a super cute and fun rope swing about 1/2 way up.  Lost of fun.  And from where this trail meets up with the other trail- it is amazing and beautiful.  I went all the way down the other trail and enjoyed every second of it.  Take the centerville doule trail instead. "

5,2019-05-19,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","We went around 7pm wasn’t crowded. Would recommend starting the hike early. The views were beautiful, one fourth of the hike was alongside the creek. It was an adventurous and a beautiful hike!"
6,2019-04-28,['hiking'],Fun hike with my pup but we were in the sun for the first good bit of the trail so be sure to have plenty of water! Close to the end we had to turn around because I couldn’t figure out how to safely cross the rushing water with my pup (she is still too small to make it in her own). If I would have actually worn my hiking shoes we would have made it.
7,2019-01-06,['hiking'],"Great hike! The trail is fully covered with snow once you get back into the canyon, crampons would be ideal, I was fine in my normal hiking boots, with some sliding in places. Waterfall is mostly frozen over, but still beautiful!"
8,2018-10-12,['hiking'],Nice hike

Great hike, Near town, moderate to difficult at times, NOT horse friendly or Mountain Bike friendly. Dogs on leashes allowed please pick up after your dog,  Many families enjoy this hike,  some scrambling at times over rocks with some steep side hills.  I see kids of all ages just go slow. Single narrow trail, most of the time, Views are best at the mouth of the canyon to over look the city.. You are  north of the Gun Range, And If you are on the freeway and you see the big V on the mountain This canyon is the first one north of the V.  It is the Deuel creek south hike. (No pictographs on this hike it is another hike). At the little Kiosk it shows the trail ending long before the rope swing or the first waterfall past the rope swing. You will see some beautiful places most people think the waterfall is a rock or steep spot where the water shoots down a steep rocky spot. It is beautiful and worth a look. However it is not the waterfall. The water cascades down the side of the rock and it disappears in the thick brush. Not technically free falling,  but it is nice all the same. Summer is my favorite  late May to Sep,  It is steep in places and requires some scrambling over rocks and steep drop offs. Those steep places with narrow trail start about 20 feet past the trail head. Dont let the  kids get out of sight at the start of the trail.  If  you have little kids just go slow and you will find places near the creek to let them play. You will see poison ivy so know what to look for and how to identify it over  4 season. Google it.  Both trails will meet up at the creek so if you parked at the North Trail head make sure that when you head down to take the North trail. Same as the South stay on the trail that is near the creek. You dont want to add a mile up and down at the end of a long hike. You will only make this mistake once :) I HIGHLY recommend a high clearance vehicle on both trail heads once you leave the pavement,  mufflers are expensive. Some times the grader has gone over the trail and it is ok other times I have seen people that where not so lucky.  When the road Ts in the bottom of the canyon take the road to the right and then at the second T turn back towards the canyon heading back north about a 1/2 mile from the first T. This trail is forest serve land and all the same rules apply. The only true water fall is past the rope swing. Kids do not  make it this far. This is where the nice trail begins. The trail and will start to look like a high alpine hike with tall pines and less Gamble oak. If you continue about another 30-40 minutes past the rope swing you will be rewarded with a view of the waterfall that you will see in the distance it is the one in the pic that says Centerville Canyon. If you continue to hike up the trail it will go right by the waterfall where you can walk out and look down over the falls. It is just a little stream at this time of the  year not much water at all. You will not see may people that will venture past the falls. It is quiet and if you are aware of your surroundings you will see all kinds of tracks and sign. If you continue up the trail it will eventually cross over two other streams and the canyon will end when the trail disappears in a Forrest. This trail has several other wooden bridges that are not forest service approved and are not sponsored by the city. It appears to be maintained by locals who do so at their own expense. We are always looking for volunteers who want to help contribute to the health and safety of the trail. And we recommend you do that thru the city who will coordinate the work thru the forest service and the sponsored third party groups. This is  Forest Service land and when venturing out please be aware that hunting season is open at this time of the year I would recommend bright colored clothes. And to stay on the trail. You can also camp just off the trail and you will find a variety of camps spots. 
 
Enjoy and let us know what you think and what you liked about our hike. 

Take a hike.

HELP ####   We have a lost hiker near this trail if you can get out tomorrow please do! Davis County Sheriff will be conducting a searchS tomorrow for a missing HUNTER r who was last seen just one canyon north at noon yesterday. He is a 19 year old male and was last seen about Noon near Parish flat Just one canyon north of Deuel creek 
Thank you

10,2018-08-24,[''],"I started this trail a little weary of it raining. I started on the north side of the creek and went back on the south side. I was a bit surprised of some ledges I didn't expect, but not a problem for me. Once you hit the 2 mile mark it's really not far to the waterfall. I stopped at the 2 mile point and almost turned back because I heard lightning but went on anyways and it was awesome."
11,2018-08-06,['hiking'],Stick to the south trail. Follows a stream the entire way. There are some trout if you fish the deeper pools. At 1.2 miles there is a fun swing attached to a tree about 20 feet high. Lots of fun for kids. The next 1.5 miles is gorgeous with a waterfall around the 3 mile mark. One of my favorite trails around
12,2018-07-21,[''],"Awesome trail. It’s gorgeous, plenty of water and waterfalls, there are fire pits all along the trail and a nice big waterfall near the end. If you go far enough as well there is a fun swing. Definitely a fun weekend hike."
13,2018-07-16,[''],"Good moderate hike, beautiful waterfall and fun swing! I didn’t see the waterfall on the way up the canyon, but found it by accident on the way down. To find it, as you head up the canyon, you’ll notice a steep drop in the trail after you’ve been steadily climbing for some time. The trail naturally veers to the left. If you go right and head down about 20 yards, you’ll find it. Then turn back around and finish the trail where there’s a swing, a bench and a fire pit."
14,2018-05-26,[''],"So... There is nowhere to park by the reservoir and the road these directions lead to is washed out really bad as you round the water to the parking lot (the lot for the south trailhead). It’s also extremely narrow so we had to back out the rough road because there was a 1-2 foot drop off that was impossible to get around! 
Decided to brave the north trailhead since we were then stuck on that side and it was NO joke! This should be rated “HARD”. Luckily it was morning - any other time of the day we would have melted. It’s straight up the mountain and there is NO coverage for quite a climb. There are also washed out bits on both trails (north and south) that are pretty scary, so just be aware. 
I was following the map provided for this hike (because I didn’t want to do the 4.5 miles) but it stops 2 miles short of the waterfall. Very misleading!!! Ends up being much longer than the 4.5 if you make it to the falls. If you’re looking for this particular hike because of the waterfall but want a MUCH easier route - just do the regular one (south trailhead) because this particular write up for the hike is extremely misleading!
Wouldn’t recommend taking any sort of kids on this trail either, and would only recommend it for people that are hard core hikers!!! 
Coming down we took the south trailhead because we missed the north - and then had to hike all the way back up to our car! Long day for me the dog and the baby. Ugh!
*Also, there is one part towards the top where you cross the stream on rocks (not a bridge like the rest of them). You can tell people have gotten lost cause there is a makeshift trail but I knew 2 minutes in we were off with all the ruggedness and grow out!"
15,2018-05-06,['hiking'],"DANGEROUS!

Starting off on the north trail (up by the water reservoir) sets you up for one of the most difficult hikes you’ll find. There are no switchbacks, just straight up the side of the hill. I was breathless for the first mile. Now, it isn’t impossible but you need to be prepared. Also, the trail is NARROW and on the settlers hillside I’ve seen. Frankly, I was scared but had gotten to a point of no return so we powered through. Lots of wash it on this hills side has left the path unstable so go slowly and take trekking poles.

All of this said, the south part of the trail is beautiful and takes you by lots of water and some mild rock scaling as you climb over a couple spots. South trail is absolutely kid friendly!"
16,2018-05-02,[''],"There are two different trails to take to get to the waterfall. I took the North trail and it was pretty strenuous. Tt took me twice the amount of time to get there than it took me to get back (I took the south back). The waterfall didn't feel worth it to me after the hike. Almost no view from the South side, and little to no shade on the North side."
17,2017-10-21,['hiking'],I really enjoyed this one!
18,2017-09-03,[''],"nice trail, love it."
19,2017-06-28,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. Well kept. Follows water the whole way. Mostly shady
20,2017-06-10,[''],The south trail is amazing!  The trail gets a bit steeper after the swing but the waterfall is worth it.  Hiked with my 11 year old
21,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"Great hike that has shade the whole way!  2.2 miles each way.  The waterfall isn't as spectacular, but the hike is perfect for all ages"
22,2017-05-28,[''],A bit more difficult than we were expecting but we made the loop with two kids in tow and loved the breath taking views.
23,2017-04-25,[''],"You spend the whole time following the stream. There are some cool waterfalls along the way. It might be difficult for small kids and old dogs, but it is a very beautiful hike. I recommend the South trail head over the North trail head. It is shadier and you almost immedeately reach the water. The bridges look dangerous, but are very very sturdy. Bring shoes you don't mind getting a little dirty or wet. In the spring there can be standing puddles on the trail. But nothing you can't inch around."
24,2017-04-24,[''],"nice trail, steep in places. went up north and down south."
25,2017-04-06,[''],"This wound around a river, had a cool swing and a couple fire pits along the way. Awesome trail and beautiful scenery!"
26,2016-11-22,[''],Love this trail
27,2016-09-29,[''],The waterfall was beautiful and the dogs loved it!
28,2016-09-09,['hiking'],"One of my favorite trail up north, it's not busy at all."
29,2016-09-05,[''],"This was a beautiful, shaded hike that runs by the creek the entire way. 5.2 miles if you go up to the waterfall and back... which is worth it. the rope swing over dirt  (which the kids love) is maybe half way to the waterfall. the trail marker actually says Deul Creek South. a guy in the parking lot said this trail is much better then the North trail.. easier and shaded. it's still a hefty hike! there were lots of kids on the trail, in fact that was the worst part- it's pretty busy, especially up to the rope swing! the trail is narrow so letting people constantly  pass, was annoying. it's busy cause it's beautiful!"
30,2016-08-27,[''],This is a beautiful trail! We stayed on the south side in the shade. The swing is about the half way mark. It's well marked so we didn't get lost. I'd do this again and take grandkids to the swing.
31,2016-08-18,['hiking'],Super fun hike. Way fun to run down the trail on the way back. You slowly gain elevation so the hike is not bad at all
32,2016-07-08,['hiking'],There are some hidden gems there. Been there countless times. We got married in this Canyon.
33,2016-07-08,['hiking'],ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS HIKE
34,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"This trail is great for scenery, shade and a little fun on the swing.  My daughters and I ran to the top and back, and took a break at the swing."
35,2016-06-06,[''],I love this hike
36,2016-05-13,[''],Love this trail. I went with Scouts and it was great.
37,2016-03-03,['hiking'],"I love this trail, I love taking my dog with me too, but the only problem is all of the brambles. If you bring your dog up you might want to think twice about it if they have a fluffy or even slightly shaggy coat. My poor dog gets herself all tangled up in those suckers, but it's a great hike."
38,2015-10-20,['hiking'],So gorgeous along the creek. Trail is quite narrow on the North side. A bit hard to find but it starts behind the North Deuel Creek trailhead sign. Several fireplaces along the way with log benches and bridges.
39,2015-08-22,[''],"All the negative reviews are just people that went to the wrong place. Go straight up Parish lane in centerville and take a left up this narrow road to a dirt parking lot. From their take the trail head to the firebreak road and head north to a bridge. On the north side of the bridge there's a pretty discreet trail head in east up the canyon. Trail is pretty run down for the most part, but there's some stellar views. Eventually you get to this point where a tree on the north bank is growing out of an alcove and it appears the trail is over but it's not!! DONT MISS THE BEST PART! Take the low way and climb up some rocks or shimmy along the boulder cause there's petroglyph stuff on the other side!!  Anyway, one of my favorite short jokes. Nice homie feel and unique art."
40,2015-08-10,[''],Lost. No indication of where trail is or starts or ends. Super steep climb in car. Waste of time.
41,2015-08-06,['hiking'],"If you head east on 100 South in Centerville you will eventually come to a dirt road. Take a right, then continue until the road forks and go left. You'll see a dirt parking lot at the trail head.

We do this hikes a couple times a year, it's great for families and dogs. There's a creek the entire way and the farthest you can go is about three miles to a nice waterfall, although few go there. Make sure to check out the rope swing about a mile in and watch out for potential poison ivy.

Overall this is a simple and fun trail for a couple hours of adventure!"
42,2015-04-15,[''],"This is a fun little hike. Took my 9 year old son and he did great. There's a few spots where I worried, like when the trail goes over a very rocky portion, but we took our time and he did fine. We went up the south side."
43,2015-02-05,['hiking'],Same as Deuel Canyon trails. Favorite close place to go.
44,2014-06-02,[''],Too steep and too narrow for children under 6.
45,2014-04-08,[''],This is a great hike. It does have some washed out areas especially near the beginning. I enjoy starting at the southern trailhead.  It is less steep at the beginning and has a good place to park as long as you don't mind driving on a rough dirt road.   Someone has fixed the swing though it felt lower this time.
46,2012-08-28,['hiking'],This is a very fast trail that my kids can do with little worry. my favorite part is when you first hit the trees they come up over the trail like a leafy cave. My only complaint its that the trails here are very poorly marked and there are private property signs all over which made me nervous that I was on the wrong trail for the first quarter mile but we found the waterfall.
47,2012-08-17,['hiking'],A little tough to find because the signs are not posted. Beautiful foliage. Be careful if u take children as there are a few drop offs and instability in the terrain. Very pretty!
