1,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"I did this hike on 6/1/19. It’s a steady elevation gain with some wild flowers along the way. There are 4 benches along the first half of the trail. Towards the end of the trail you come across a couple scenic meadows. 
There is a .2 off shoot trail near end of the this trail where the trail meets up with a dirt road. The .2 trail is growing over. There is nothing to see along the way or at the end of the mini trail. 
I got caught in a thunderstorm while hiking. Fortunately the trail didn’t become too muddy or slippery."

3,2019-05-04,[''],Not our favorite. Definitely super Rocky and steep. You better have some good shoes if you don't want to twist your ankles. The mileage recorded for this hike is definitely short about a mile. We did the two and a half miles in and didn't make it to the Fork Trail. It should be 6.5 miles.
4,2019-04-22,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","Daughter and I are training for 168 mile hike in August. This was a perfect training hike! Almost all uphill until you get to the meadow at the end. Beautiful scenery - very rocky. Muddy in spots, but hiked it in April so lots of Spring runoff. Both our iPhones said it was 6.2 miles, not 5.2 miles as described. Was difficult going up but much faster going back."
5,2019-03-25,"['hiking', 'snow']",pretty fun hike but couldn’t make it the full way due to snow and my unwillingness to continue in tennis shoes. definitely doable with spikes however. will probably do it again once it’s a lil more green
6,2019-02-23,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail']",Awesome ridge walk. Saw close to 25 deer
7,2018-09-17,['off road driving'],"There’s no motorized vehicles allowed, not an off-road trail."
8,2018-07-20,['hiking'],Good hike if you are just wanting to put some miles down.
9,2018-07-05,[''],Continuous steep climb with not a great view at the top lots of butterflies. Parts are tough to walk because of loose rocks.  Shady parts goi g up in the am but all sunny on the way down. At least 1/2 mile walk to trail head.
10,2017-12-31,[''],"My husband, 18 month old son and I hiked this yesterday, Dec. 29th. 
It was hard to find the trail at first but once we found it it was a great hike. You end up at squaw peak forest road.
I would recommend bringing snowshoes for the 2nd half of the trail!"
11,2017-09-29,[''],"My GPS took me up Spring Oaks Drive where the trailhead was a little hard to see, but there was a sign that said something about no motorized vehicles. it was in a neighborhood and I wasn’t sure where to park… I was lucky that someone is outside who was really friendly and told me I could park just on the curb pointed out the trailhead. The trail itself was nice! Pretty rocky and pretty dry, so running with a little more challenging."
12,2017-07-18,['hiking'],"The dirt road to the water tank is closed so I had to park up and around the corner, adds about 0.5 miles one way. The trail doesn't get too steep but there's a few places with a lot of loose rocks, especially if you connect up to the summit. But I didn't see a single person and the view is worth it!"
13,2017-07-04,['hiking'],Fun little trail. At the top I connected to trail 759 to ascend to the summit with a beautiful view to Spanish Fork Peak and Mount Nebo in the distance.
14,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Very mellow, decently shaded.  Nice because it was rather quiet, but not a whole lot to see and it ends pretty quickly.  Looks like there's opportunity to continue in other directions at the top."
15,2017-05-20,['hiking'],"I just tried this hike for the first time and really enjoyed it. There are lots of wildflowers and butterflies right now. It ends in a grassy-meadow area between peaks with a really pretty view of some snow-capped (for now) peaks in the distance. From there you can take trails to your right or left for a longer hike. To begin the hike, park where Center St dead ends and walk along the dirt road until just past the water shed where you will come to a gate - take the trail off to your left just before the gate (trail not marked)."
16,2016-10-29,['trail running'],"I run/hike this trail almost every week with my dogs. It's starts moderately on a dirt road it quickly narrows to a rocky trail. Middle section is super Rocky, a lot of loose rocks. Makes it hard to run. Good area to slow down and hike. Save the ankles. The top reaches a T at the pole Haven dirt road. If you take it to the left you can follow the pole Haven Road all the way to squaw Peak. Take a right and you'll head down to hobble Creek Canyon. Can finish the run on pavement out of hobble creek, back to town, returning to the trailhead to get a challenging 14 mile run."
17,2016-10-20,['hiking'],Love this trail! I hike it often. I hiked it today (Oct 19). It's still steep and rocky as ever. It's a bit windy at the top and the leaves have all fallen. But it's still great weather and well worth it!
18,2016-06-15,['hiking'],"Great trail! It gets narrow in some spots, and it can be pretty steep. Not a beginner trail. But it's well worth it! It's incredibly green, and all around a fun hike. My dog did great, too and she is a Mini Aussie."
19,2016-05-31,['trail running'],excellent trail.  Very solitudinal. easy access to squaw peak road for more miles.
20,2016-04-22,['hiking'],I have hiked this trail overbthe years and also enjoy how secluded it is.  It is a very quiet trail with very little traffic.  Moderately steep with the middle portion being rocky bit this turns back to smooth dirt trail about 1.5 miles up.  Early morning start is best due to it being very open and exposed the whole way.
21,2015-09-13,['bird watching'],"Beautiful trail, without the crowding of the Provo Canyon Trail."
22,2015-03-17,['mountain biking'],"Really smooth and nice at the top, really rocky at the middle... very rocky. Expert only or walk the middle part."
