It's heavily wooded most of the way so you're not in bright sunshine. I didn't experience a lot of bugs either which surprised me.

My dog loved it. "
1,2019-08-10,['backpacking'],"Went backpacking and camped by just passed Dog Lake. We took our dog and it was a really fun trail, a lot of incline on the way up but almost the whole way back is downhill. We hiked back the next morning in an even day and there were a lot of bikers. Great covered from the sun with the trees on both ways. For backpacking with a dog the bikers were a little much on the way back in the morning, that is the reason I give this 4 stars and not 5."
2,2019-08-07,['hiking'],great moderately difficult loop. kids did awesome. will return. not terribly busy on a Wednesday morning.
3,2019-07-22,['hiking'],We went on an odd numbered day and enjoyed the beautiful views with our pups off leash. We didn't have trouble with too many bugs. Lake is wonderful and definitely worth the hike!

5,2019-07-14,['hiking'],A nice trail for shade on the hot summer days. Dogs are supposed to be on leash on even numbered days. I think of it as odd=off. Leash compliance is as low on this trail as the rest of Millcreek Canyon and highly trafficked. 
6,2019-07-11,['trail running'],"I give it 4 because everyone that ever enters Millcreek  Canyon asks me ""how do you get to Dog lake?"" It is beautiful tho and easy and dog friendly, so there is that.  As for the hike/run yesterday, had to park in overflow parking 0.2 miles down the road (was 5pm on Thurs) and 100F in the Valley (74 up there). It gave me credit for this loop, and I have done it all, but yesterday I went up Red Pine Road trail to the crest then back down and down little water trail. On this journey I saw 2 people.  Point is everyone goes up Big Water and even with a full parking lot, Little Water was empty. Anyway, dog lake is a relatively easy hike up a great trail with lots of shade and dog friendly, so 5 stars for that 3 for the fact that Big Water is crowded.  "
7,2019-07-02,['hiking'],I would recommend this trail! I am from out of town and this hike was a gradual uphill and it was beautiful. Highly recommend. 
8,2018-10-25,[''],"I love this hike. FYI, Winter gate is already up for the season (they closed it before Nov. 1 this year). If you want to do this one from the starting point shown here, you'll need to road walk 4.5 miles to get to the trailhead after parking at the picnic area in front of the Winter gate, yikes. Or you could get to the lake via Big Cottonwood, but no dogs allowed on that side."
9,2018-10-06,[''],"Great hike, the lake is a little disappointing but the views throughout make up for it. Take the west trail up for a more gradual climb"
10,2018-09-02,[''],"Great loop with the dog.  Dogs allowed off-leash on odd numbered dates (mountain bikers allowed, and dogs on leash even numbered dates)"
11,2018-08-29,[''],"I like to take Little Water up and Big Water down. It's a good, quick day hike. I start midmorning, eat lunch at the lake, then hike back out."
12,2018-08-27,[''],Very busy from Thursday to Sunday with zero trailer parking. Not worth the 20 mile round trip drive to find out the parking lot is full.
13,2018-07-15,['camping'],"Gorgeous trail, and one I would definitely do again. The wildflowers are coming out right now, making it an especially good time to go. FYI: I would rate this trail as ""highly trafficked."" My husband felt like we were on a highway. We backpacked in and then camped at the top, and people were at the lake until the dark was settling in and again the next morning by 7 a.m. Not the place to go for solitude."
14,2018-07-15,[''],Nice shaded hike to beat the heat but knocked a star bc that lake was so damn ugly 
15,2018-07-14,['hiking'],Beautiful hike with lots of shade. If you hike on an even day there are lots of mountain bikes. Go early on the weekend because parking fills quickly.  By 10 AM they were ticketing folks who parked illegally.
16,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"We hiked this trail this morning and it was great. We were surprised at how continuous the incline was but other than that it was great. My dog had a great time, the wildflowers were in bloom and there weren't many people or dogs at the lake."
17,2018-06-19,['hiking'],"slow jog from the winter gate--->Little Water trailhead--->200yds from Little Water peak@sunset, so I had to turn around before I got to cold (tank-top+T-shirt). It was a unplanned hike but beautiful as nature provides. I'm  planning on backpacking."
18,2018-06-11,[''],I didnâ€™t realize the last 5 miles of the road were closed until 7/1. Instead of a hike I took a 2 mile stroll up the canyon and then back to the car.
19,2017-12-09,['hiking'],"I entered it from the big cottonwood side (12-8-17), 6 miles round trip. It was so peaceful, snowy, but manageable without snow shoes. the lake is covered with snow and a moderate hike  overall. go for the quiet."
20,2017-08-20,['trail running'],"Probably my favorite Wasatch trail - you can do this portion just up to Dog Lake, or go on from there to Desolation Lake - that's what I just did (this is part of the Wasatch 100 Mile Endurance Run that I did several times in the early 90's). Good trail, runnable in many sections, beautiful vistas of the Wasatch ranges separating Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon on the newly cut trail from Dog Lake to Desolation (take the left fork just out of Dog Lake - bypassing the dive down to the Mill D trail and the climb back up again). Incredible wildflowers. A stellar afternoon."
21,2017-08-16,['hiking'],The map shows a trail running off the Great Western and there is no such trail. You need to go to Dog Lake and go up from there.
22,2017-07-18,['hiking'],"Beautiful views, shaded areas, path not too rocky.  Dog Lake, at the end of the trail, is pretty big. My dog and I really enjoyed it."
23,2017-05-22,['hiking'],"Excellent hike, my dachshund loved this one. It's not a crazy elevation gain and I'd rate it easy. Beautiful lake to see at the end, I'd like to hike it from Big Cottonwood Canyon side now!"
24,2016-10-04,[''],Easy hike with great views.
25,2016-10-03,[''],Loved it! Wouldn't rate it hard at all. Beautiful in the fall
26,2016-09-29,['hiking'],"Went up little water trail, it wasn't as hard as some of the other hikes we've done, but it was a continuously  uphill hike. On the way down we took the path of big water trail which ends up in the same parking lot as little. Much easier but a little longer trail but still good! Not too many other hikers because it was a weekday. No bugs which was nice, brought bug spray just in case. The tree's are dropping huge amounts of yellow leaves so it was very pretty,"
27,2016-09-13,['hiking'],"Only one star because there is another listing for the Little Water Trail.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great trail.  Just see the other listing."
28,2016-09-13,['backpacking'],Great hike for dogs.
29,2016-08-30,['trail running'],"beautiful, some sections a little steeper, mostly shaded throughout."
30,2016-08-12,['hiking'],"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I do my hikes on weekdays to avoid crowds, so I found serenity almost the entire trail. The scenery is like a fairytale! Wildflowers, meadows, bubbling streams... just perfect. It is steep, but there are flat parts for you to catch your breath. The lake at the end was warm enough to swim in. Overall I feel in love with this trail. My pup also loved it!"
31,2016-07-21,['hiking'],"7.20.2016 | 6:00-8:00PM Round Trip
Must Have: Bug Repellent

First time and was disappointed. It's a good short workout but there were SO MANY FLIES. Maybe I just went at bug o'clock, maybe it's being near the water, maybe this is their kingdom due to high traffic and dogs/dog poop, but regardless of dousing myself in bug spray I couldn't get away from them. They'd repeatedly fly into my face and I felt like I should've just windmilled my arms the whole time to get some peace! 

There was rarely a breeze and the lake was COATED with mosquitoes so I didn't let my GSD swim as planned. Going down wasn't as buggy and I picked up multiple abandoned poop bags and old piles to pack out and throw away. I'll give this trail a second chance at some point but it certainly didn't leave a good first impression."
32,2016-07-15,['hiking'],"Good hike, encountered a few people on the trail but didn't feel crowded. Easy hike"
33,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"It was pretty steep, so I would not recommend it for a starter trail, but it was really pretty and we saw some moose."
34,2015-09-25,['hiking'],The aspens are changing colors and look absolutely stunning. I had a great time on this hike last weekend :)
35,2015-08-25,['hiking'],Good trail. People need to pack out the dog poop if they bring their dogs. Trail was littered with plastic bags full of poop. Scenery good. Would rather of biked it and prefer less dogs. Will gladly do it again
36,2015-08-02,[''],Great hike!!! Beautiful trail and it's fun to have a lake to hike to!! Not extremely busy for a weekend! Lots of dogs and people don't follow the leash rule on even numbered days.
37,2015-08-02,[''],I think we went up the old trail and were told it was a little harder. I bit of a work out! The flowers and stream were so pretty though!
38,2015-07-21,['hiking'],Good once you get on the trail!!! Parking lot is a nightmare. Filled with people who aren't even there to hike... Even witnessed a lady fighting over a parking spot.
39,2015-07-12,['road biking'],"Little Water Trail is beautiful. From this trail  you can hike to different destinations such a Dog Lake, Desolation Lake and others. Trail directions are clearly marked along trail as well as the trail head is clearly marked. Parking is limited up at trail head but there are two over flow parking areas. Trail is smooth with a steady incline. Dogs on leash allowed on odd days and cyclist allowed on even days. Plenty of flowers and trees and wildlife to see. Trail can get crowded so early mornings are best to have uncrowded hiking conditions. There is a water feature hence the name Little Water Trail, bridges to cross and mountain views to see. Definitely a beautiful leisurely hiking trail. Check each destination on this trail for miles, although there are clearly marked signs on the trail indicating miles to destination."
40,2015-07-05,['hiking'],Great for kids. We had a blast! Our dog did as well..
41,2015-07-05,['walking'],"Very pleasant hike. Read other reviews, there is good info on the trail
In them! Biggest piece of info that is good to know is:

ODD DAYS: hiking with animals no leash required.

EVEN DAYS: bikes allowed.

Plan accordingly, and please clean up your doggie poopie!"
42,2014-07-15,[''],"There's lots of flora and fauna. It's a beautiful hike and you can take it to Dog Lake, or even a roundabout way to Desolation Lake. There are a lot of mountain bikers on this trail system, so definitely keep your dogs on leash on the even days. I was pretty careful to keep my dog at the edge of the trail but the bikers caught me off guard a couple times."
43,2013-08-22,['hiking'],Nice trail
44,2012-08-21,['hiking'],"Beautiful all the way up. There are several trails that connect into and branch off of each other. Good signage makes following the trails easy. It is pretty steep in some parts but our little wiener dog made it all the way up with no help. It was quite busy, lots of people and dogs.

Bikes are allowed on the trails and dogs have to be on a leash on even numbered days. On odd numbered days, no bikes and dogs can be off leash."
45,2012-08-01,['hiking'],"I came down this trail today. Glad I didn't go up! It is a bit steep with lots of loose rock, gravel. This would be a good trail for those who need to tone up!"
46,2012-08-01,['hiking'],"Length: 6 miles round trip 
Elevation Gain: 1200 ft 
Highest Elevation: 8,780 ft 
Trailhead: 9 miles into Mill Creek Canyon, designated as ""Big Water"" trailhead 

There are actually several lakes named Dog Lake in Utah. There are even two in the Wasatch. But the Dog Lake of this article is the one where actual dogs are allowed to visit. 

This trail has several trailheads, both in Big Cottonwood Canyon and also in MillCreek Canyon. The Big Cottonwood side is for people only, the Mill Creek side allows other critters. It is a popular hike for various modes of travel (hiking, biking and horseback riding), and is also dog-friendly. 

You will have company on this trail, but if you are a dog lover, it will be fun to meet all the friendly four-legged hikers as you stroll up the trail. If you are one of the lucky ones who can bring your canine friends, please be a responsible pet owner and clean up after them. There are plastic bags provided at the beginning of the trail for scooping up the treasures your little ones leave behind. 

The hike is a a little longer than the others in the ""easy"" category, but the grade is an easy one which makes the three miles up not seem so long, and watching the dogs frolic in the lake, catching sticks and chasing each other around is an amusing site for the weary traveller. Take a seat on the shores and watch the dogs for awhile while you rest and prepare for the journey back down the mountain.

Today, I took the Big Water trail, which is longer but has a gentler slope.
 
For those of you who would like a nice hike, this is definitely one to consider.  That goes double if you want to hike with your dog. I saw people at all different levels of fitness on the trail. It took us around 1 hour and 30 minutes to reach the lake. Obviously, it takes longer if you go slower or stop more. But it really is a fairly easy hike.
 
Two tips: First, if it's hot, be sure to take enough water for you and your dog. Second, if you're taking a dog, go on an odd-numbered day. Dogs can be off-leash on odd-numbered days, and bike are allowed on the trail only on even-numbered days.
 
I realized that when I hike normally, I don't spend a whole lot of time at the destination. Today was a bit different. And the dogs loved it!
 
On the way back, we took a slightly different route near the bottom that took us to the upper parking lot. I then walked a short distance down the road to my car."
