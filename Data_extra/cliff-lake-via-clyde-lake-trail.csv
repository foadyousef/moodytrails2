0,2019-08-06,"['camping', 'bugs']","This site has a parking lot with bathrooms and its $6 for a day pass, we hiked, climbed and camped. We saw some people fishing and I think we can get in the water, i'll be going back for sure! It was our first time rock climbing outdoors and we were all able to belay. Check out pictures of this site on our IG page @southlandadventure BRING PLENTY OF MOSQUITO REPELLENT "
1,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade']",This was a beautiful trail! Directions took me right to the TH. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the bugs were so horrible we couldn't sit down and enjoy the lake once we got there. Absolutely beautiful. 
2,2019-07-28,['hiking'],This is a great hike to do with kids. Easy trail and beautiful lakes. 
3,2019-07-13,['hiking'],Easy hike. Really beautiful lakes and trail.
4,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'snow']",Short and easy. Dog loved it. Not too trafficked. A little snow on the trail in late June 
5,2018-11-24,[''],very beautiful and easy for kids.
6,2018-06-18,[''],"If you just want a short trail , not a lot of elevation gain,thats enjoyable and has a beautiful lake as your destination then this is it.
Great to bring visitors that may not be able to hike long distance at  high elevations.  Perfect to squeeze in if you don't have all day"
7,2017-11-05,['fishing'],Extremely easy hike to the lake. Good views.
8,2017-08-15,[''],Great hike for families and little kids. More crowded than I would have liked. There were quite a few hikers with fishing poles headed on to the next lakes.
9,2017-07-04,[''],An amazing place for backpacking. Absolutely beautiful! Great fishing at Clyde Lake.
10,2017-06-26,['backpacking'],"Cool hike, when I went there was still a good amount of snow around the lake.  I want to go backpacking there when it clears up a little bit.  I even saw some climbers on one of the cliffs"
11,2016-08-05,['hiking'],"Awesome!!! Short hike, so we went beyond and hit all the surrounding lakes.  Best time ever"
12,2016-07-24,['hiking'],This is a great classic Uintas hike taking you to Cliff Lake though the map and milage on this description is off. It is probably only a mile round trip to get to Cliff Lake. You can also continue further and get to Petit and Watson Lakes too. This would be about 3 miles round trip to go all the ways to Watson and back.

13,2016-07-01,['hiking'],Did a quick out and back to see how the snow looks in the area. Pretty much gone from the area and the trail is dry.
14,2015-08-17,['hiking'],"We were coming down from Haystack Mountain and we saw that Cliff Lake was only .40 of a mile from the trail so we took a turn and came to check it out.  Cool Spot, glad we took the detour."
15,2015-08-17,['fishing'],Nice easy hike with awesome scenery all around.
16,2015-08-02,['hiking'],Great short hike. Trail continues into some other wonderful areas. Keep going and soak it all in!
17,2015-07-04,[''],Easy hike (except for that elevation!) Great for any skill level. The lake is quite pretty with the cliff face as a backdrop. Wear bug spray!
18,2015-06-17,['camping'],"Great short hike up to Cliff lake! Took the kiddos too (4-6-8), all handled it pretty well. Even hiked above Cliff lake to Petite lake (very pretty - lots of bugs!) 
Camped up at petite lake! Lots of fun!"
19,2014-05-23,['hiking'],Hiked several times with children
20,2013-07-29,[''],Hiking was really pretty easy but a few steep sections. Caught nothing and barely saw any fish jumping when a huge hatch was going on.
