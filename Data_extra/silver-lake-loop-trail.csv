3,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Beautiful view, really really crowded making it difficult to walk. "
4,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"Loved this easy walk around, stroller friendly path. My son (2) started in the stroller and a quarter into it, he walked because he was so curious and eager to explore. 

Halfway, was a little opening to the water where we saw a family of ducks. 

Near the picnic tables are loads of squirrels, chipmunks, and birds.

9,2019-08-14,['hiking'],Lovely easy walk. 
10,2019-08-13,['hiking'],"I do this “hike” all of the time with my 3 year old and now 1 year old. It is super easy, beautiful views, and fun for kids (especially if you bring duck food to feed the ducks. That is the highlight)."
11,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"loved! we took the added hike to Twin Lake which was a bit steep for my kids (age 7, age 10), but they hung on there and we loved reaching the lake. on the way back down to Silver Lake, we saw a 2 point buck & two doe. Gorgeous dusk hike!"
12,2019-08-09,['hiking'],"I'm a  very over weight non-hiker, and forgot to put my sneakers on as well... this was easy peezy. Very, very busy. "
13,2019-08-09,['hiking'],Great little stroll and nice for out-of-town family and friends who are getting acclimated to the altitude. Nice to do on a weekday when it’s a lot less crowded! 
14,2019-08-03,['hiking'],Saw 2 moose great walk
15,2019-07-30,['bugs'],"it was beautiful!
I love outdoors and with little kids its sometimes hard to hike, but this one is perfect for little ones..."
16,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']","It was l lots of fun.  My husband, daughter, grandson & I went. We packed a picnic lunch ahead of time and ate it there.  There was a few bugs.  My daughter & grandson got bug bites.  There is a few spots were it is muddy but that too bad.  "
17,2019-07-17,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Pretty and very easy. Lots of mosquitoes so remember to bring your bug spray. 
18,2019-07-10,['hiking'],Very pretty location. It is a very easy walk. 
19,2019-06-17,['hiking'],Great trail for families. Our 4 yr old walked it with no problems. There were only a few snow patches that were easy to cross.
20,2019-06-13,[''],"Ice is mostly melted on the water for you fishermen. DWR is stocking next week, but today the fly fishing was "
21,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'snow']","This is a beautiful, easy trail. I recommend a walking stick when there’s melting snow on the path. I sank over a foot deep a few times and there were some slippery slopes."
22,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'muddy']",It's beautiful up there but the loop trail is still covered in snow which we were surprised since it is June. The drive is still worth it though because it's so pretty. 
23,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'snow']",This trail was a nice loop. It was covered with snow but was very enjoyable and picturesque. Definitely recommend!
24,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",6/8/19 - still mostly covered in inches and inches of snow! Wear proper shoes.
25,2019-05-18,['hiking'],
26,2019-04-27,['hiking'],"The lake, boardwalk, and trails are still buried under snow as of 4/27/2019."
27,2019-03-30,[''],"Easy, enjoyable hike!"
28,2019-02-03,[''],Love this area its awesome and beautiful
29,2018-10-20,['hiking'],"Beautiful, easy, leisurely walk. 
October 19 packed snow, icy in the morning and muddy in the afternoon."
30,2018-10-14,[''],"Packed slush and ice on most of the path today, October 13. Lots of parents and kids slipping around. Some puddles in places. Bring boots with good tread or microspikes. Your feet will get wet this week. Gorgeous and sunny today, a beautiful walk as the lake begins to freeze."
31,2018-09-19,['hiking'],"Really pretty lake, especially with the aspens changing colors. Easy loop, great for kids and we will head back tomorrow with our grandson to head up to Solitude Lake from here."
32,2018-09-19,['walking'],Pleasant easy stroll.  Path is easy enough for strollers and wheelchairs.  The boardwalk is fun.  So are the Pokestops and gyms ;)
33,2018-09-17,[''],Perfect walk for family with little babies or toddlers!
34,2018-09-06,[''],Nice easy stroll. Very pretty area. Commonly see moose.
35,2018-09-02,[''],Such a quick fun nice walk. It was beautiful. Very much enjoyed it.
36,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"Beautiful lake, easy hike for kids. Flat boardwalk. Neat visitors center."
37,2018-08-19,[''],"super easy trail, great for older folks and little toddler legs"
38,2018-08-18,['walking'],A fun little nature walk with our 2 year old. We actually didn't walk around the whole thing this time. Instead we decided to do the Lake Solitude hike to test out our little guy. He did wonderful on both this walk and the hike.
39,2018-08-14,['walking'],"Easy, Fun..great for everyone and great for an easy walk. Saw some cute squirrels and a few deer."
40,2018-08-14,[''],Quick & Stroller friendly. We saw baby squirrels and chipmunks on the trail as well as rainbow trout in the lake.
41,2018-08-12,[''],"Great for little kids! Easy surfaces, mostly flat, and plenty of Marsh, forest, and shallow lake to see."
42,2018-07-30,[''],"Who doesn’t love this hike, though?"
43,2018-07-26,[''],Wonderful easy hike !!!
44,2018-07-16,[''],"Great, easy trail and boardwalk around the lake. Surroundings were beautiful."
45,2018-07-10,[''],Really nice trail with kids
46,2018-07-08,['hiking'],"As fun as it is at the top of Big Cottonwood Canyon, this is a bit crowded for my liking. Nice easy walk around the lake. Good mix of shade and sun. Easy path. But ultimately, not that rewarding."
47,2018-07-08,[''],"This trail is beautiful, lots of wildflowers  and it's very easy! "
48,2018-07-08,['walking'],"Beautiful lake. Flew my drone over it and got great footage. It’s just pretty crowded and I didn’t know this until the other day, but they don’t allow bikes on the trail... so if you planning to go on a small little bike ride with your family around the lake, it ain’t happening. But besides that it’s a pretty lake."
49,2018-06-24,['walking'],"Very easy trail but also very busy trail. Even on other more popular trails you can eventually get away from people. Not so on this one at all. I did see a moose so that was cool, but other than that I would not go again."
50,2018-06-08,['walking'],The best part about this trail is the location.  Beautiful. Cool fresh air.  Busy with activity and lots of people.
51,2018-06-04,[''],Easy trail with beautiful scenery. Limited parking and very crowded on the boardwalk itself.
52,2018-06-03,[''],"I like the board walks and the scenery. The lake is beautiful but so many people take photos there. There are a lot of people that walk it as well. I saw a 93 year old person there tonight, I was impressed."
53,2018-05-29,['hiking'],Even though it was a cloudy day I done the Silver Lake loop and the hike to Twin Lakes. There are parts of both trails that have snow slush (last quarter of Twin Lakes) but the birds and critters were out for my enjoyment. The lake would be gorgeous on a sunny day with the reflection. But it is an easy hike along a board walk and dirt in some places. Twin Lakes lake is still frozen with snow on it. It is starting to thaw out though. On the way up I saw a Marmot and a little fat creature which I do not know its name. :)
54,2018-05-25,['hiking'],"THIS TRAIL IS INACCESSIBLE TO HIKERS IN THE SPRING!  We tried to do Brighton lakes today (March 30, 2018) and those trails were under feet of snow, so we went to silver lake since we'd walked it many times in the summer.  It was closed to any walkers.  There were lots of cross country skiiers, but if anyone walking tried to go out near where the lake is covered in snow, a worker would come out and let them know it wasn't allowed.  Stay down in the valley until at least June, probably July.  It's marvelous in the summer, super easy (strollers and wheelchairs okay), but bring bug spray!    "
55,2017-11-27,['hiking'],"Ironically, this trail which is quite flat and a boardwalk most of the way was harder than going up in elevation to Twin Lakes today. This is because some parts of the trail were snow packed, while others slushy, while others totally un-snow-covered and others icy and slushy. But, the fun part of the trail today was seeing lots of families come out in their best clothes for destination photos and some others trying to break the ice and a few brave ones going out on the ice. The trail was full of entertainment, no doubt."
56,2017-09-30,[''],"This isn’t a hike, unless you get off the scenic boardwalk. Although this boardwalk has very good views of the wetland!"
57,2017-09-27,['walking'],"Not so much a hike, but more of a nice scenic walk along Silver Lake by Brighton Ski Resort. A popular spot since almost anyone can manage the trail on the Boardwalk and dirt paths. A nice place for a family if you want to cater to people who can't do much outdoors. Or if you just want to go outside for some fresh air and not hike up a trail.

PROS
Easy trail to follow and anyone can walk it. You can easily take young kids, Seniors, and strollers along the way.
Beautiful Scenery. 
Picnic Tables, benches to sit on along the trail, and view areas away from the trail to take in the sights or enjoy a snack.
NEUTRAL (Pro or Con depending on your view)
Short. (Only a Mile Loop)
A chunk of the trail is uncovered and exposes you to the sun.
Can encounter some Wildlife.
CONS
Can get VERY busy. Even in the off season.
Parking can be an issue in busier times of the year.
Trail can get very slick and muddy if it has rained, snowed, or there is frost."
58,2017-09-13,['hiking'],Very easy loop trail with great opportunity for wildlife including moose early morning or late afternoon.
59,2017-09-10,['walking'],"Wonderful looped trail with the kids! Great views accompany an easy walk. Saw some moose, are some snacks; what more could we ask for?"
60,2017-09-09,['walking'],Easy trail and beautiful views of the lake. We saw a moose at the head of the trail. We did this in July 2017.
61,2017-09-02,['hiking'],This is a beautiful boardwalk. Great for families and even strollers.
62,2017-08-19,[''],Easy nature walk. Paved dirt or boardwalk around entire loop. Lots of information signs around.
63,2017-08-19,['hiking'],Very pretty and scenic. Easy and quick loop around the lake.
64,2017-08-17,[''],Great path and very easy!
65,2017-08-16,[''],"I wouldn't call this a hike, but it is a nice boardwalk around the lake. We like to have picnics there. Very crowded on weekends and evenings."
66,2017-08-09,['hiking'],A good and pretty hike... Just felt too short and busy for me considering the drive.
67,2017-08-09,[''],Great short hike for kids!
68,2017-07-21,[''],fun
69,2017-07-18,[''],went around this before doing twin lakes and solitude. saw a moose! gorgeous views on the early morning.
70,2017-07-16,['walking'],"Very simple, very flat, and my seven months pregnant self and two year old made it around by ourselves.  Just what we were looking for.  Bring bug spray, the skeeters are crazy!"
71,2017-07-12,['hiking'],"We love this beautiful walk around Silver Lake and try to go at least once every summer.  It's the perfect way to get out of the heat of the Salt Lake Valley, and even little kids can do it.  We caught a nice rainbow trout last night too!"
72,2017-07-09,['walking'],"This is an easy, family friendly hike. We love going towards the end of the day. The light at that time is absolutely gorgeous. We finally saw a moose! We always look for one but never see one."
73,2017-07-02,[''],very beautiful scenery really easy Boardwalk very easy-going Trail anybody can do this anytime of the day because there is a lot of shade we were lucky enough to see to Moose while up there
74,2017-06-27,['walking'],"Beautiful scenery, board walk is accessible, and the distance very manageable. Went on a Saturday around 4:30 PM and it was pretty busy. 6/24/2017"
75,2017-06-23,[''],"usually busy, but a good time. moose frequent this spot"
76,2017-06-16,[''],This trail is easy and short with a lot of people. The view is beautiful!
77,2017-06-14,['hiking'],We love to take a drive up the canyon and do the Silver Lake loop trail. It's super easy and kid-friendly.
78,2017-06-01,[''],"Easy walking path most of the summer.  went May 31 and there was still quite a bit of snow covering the boardwalk so dont wear sandals.
temperature was perfect!  gorgeous photos!"
79,2017-05-16,[''],"Fair warning, USFS advises road access to the trail head will not open until ""The 2nd week of June, or so.""

The road is closed as part of the reservoir and camp site repairs on the section of road you have to drive through to access Silver Lake. Your alternative is to hike an additional 4 miles or so to reach the trail head from the reservoir parking area.

If you're uncertain, phone first.

80,2017-05-03,[''],"This whole area is still snow covered... But, still beautiful views of you don't mind slogging through deep snow. I'll have to come back later this summer"
81,2017-02-01,['hiking'],"Silver Lake is located in big cottonwood canyon and is visited by many people. . The boardwalk is amazing, giving you the opportunity to walk all the way around the lake. The water is like a mirror that reflects a beautiful mountain range! be prepared for fishers, groups of tourists, families with strollers and photographers! and it is never a bad idea to through on some bug spray before heading up! this slow moving shallow body of water is perfect for little winged creatures."
82,2016-11-14,[''],I wouldn't call the a hike. More of a nice stroll but very pretty. Was fun to let the 1 1/2 year old walk along the boardwalk. Very busy area. No dogs.
83,2016-11-14,['hiking'],"We hiked the Silver Lake Loop Trail yesterday afternoon (11/13/2016), the drive to get there was lovely. Once we got there we realized we weren't dressed for the cold weather, but that didn't stop us. We did the loop rather quickly, once we did that we found a second trail that took you up towards the top of the mountain. My mom who is 58 years old was able to do both the walk around the lake and the more difficult hike. She wasn't able to go all the way up because there was some ice on the path and I was afraid she would fall. My daughter and I made it to the top with no problems. Beautiful scenery. Beautiful views. We saw 2 dogs even though it clearly states that dogs are not allowed. I def recommend this hike to all. It was lovely and we will def go up there again."
84,2016-11-07,[''],"Early November about an hour before sunrise - lake is partially frozen, leaves have fallen, but the lake is a gorgeous contrast with the surrounding pines and snowcapped mountains.

I did this loop with my mom and younger brother and it was lovely. Even though there were a lot of other people around the lake, the trail didn't feel crowded at all. 

Very easy little trail, well worth the drive up the canyon for the views."
85,2016-10-30,['hiking'],"The trail around Silverlake is boardwalked all the way around and is a very easy trail. I went when it was raining and it smelled like pinetrees and soil. It was awesome! Great trail for kids. If you want to make things a little more challenging, take the spur trail that goes up to Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes Trail is rocky and slippery when it's wet, but the views of the lake by the dam are spectacular."
86,2016-10-15,['hiking'],Really easy but awesome place
87,2016-10-12,['hiking'],"This is an easy walk around a nice lake, though it can be pretty crowded. Saw some wildlife once we got away from the larger groups on the boardwalk. The 1.5yo in our group loved watching the ducks. For the adults, better to continue to Twin Lakes for a nicer hike experience, or at least to head along the Twin Lakes trail until you come out of the trees for a magnificent view of Silver Lake from above."
88,2016-10-09,['walking'],We did the loop last weekend with the family. It was busy but we had fun. It was more of a walk than a hike. Short and sweet. The lake was beautiful.
89,2016-09-26,['hiking'],Another trail our family does just to get out of town for an hour or two. Awesome.
90,2016-09-25,['hiking'],"Got up to Silver Lake/Brighton early this morning.  Lake was calm in the early morning with the sun just past cresting the peaks to the east. Able to get many reflection shots in the lake. Lots of color with the aspens, clear blue sky, and new snow."
91,2016-09-19,['hiking'],This Trail was Beautiful on lots of fun just walking with the family. You can even take a stroller around the board walk. If you want to bring LO and do a hike I recommend no stroller and doing the twin lake hike. Its super steep and rocky but so worth it and kids younger than six were hiking this! We had my 11 month old on my husbands back and he enjoyed ever bit of it! I give this 5 stars!
92,2016-09-06,[''],"Very easy and pretty setting, i suggest going up to twin lakes and stopping at the white Rock area, great view of silver lake but too difficult to go any father"
93,2016-09-05,[''],Great little hike.
94,2016-08-29,[''],"My family has been going to Silver Lake for 20 years, and it isn't the same anymore. It used to be a very peaceful place to go, but now it is very overcrowded and it's quite obvious that the rangers cannot keep up with the crowds and do nothing to manage them. The hike is very nice and scenic, if you can survive the whole way around without getting shoved off the path by impatient parents pushing strollers or unattended children. Fishing is almost impossible now as the majority of people are quite disrespectful of your lines. The best time of day for peaceful fishing is sunrise to about 10 am or sunset until 10pm."
95,2016-08-28,['hiking'],"Very simple but very pretty trail around Silver Lake. Most of its boardwalk extends out into a meadow and then along the lake shoreline. Little busy, as expected. Great place for some fishing, picnicking, and to get in a simple walk. I hear on occasion moose might frequent the area!"
96,2016-08-27,['walking'],Great for kids because it's more like a walk. Stroller friendly and the view is gorgeous! Multiple pokestops and gyms. There are some cool boulders with pyrite by the parking lot. Multiple picnic areas as well as restrooms.
97,2016-08-14,['hiking'],Simple hike with the kids.  Our two and five year olds loved it.
98,2016-08-06,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! Great for kids.
99,2016-07-30,[''],We went in the spring while there was still snow. No one was around and we had never been there. It was absolutely gorgeous! We walked around and many times got sunk in the deep deep snow. It got somewhat strenuous in the deep snow for my three boys and myself caring my youngest. But if we looked closely on the trees there are markers to tell which way to go. It was slightly snowing and the most beautiful sight of the month!
100,2016-07-30,[''],Very short so we decide to go up to lake solitude. If you are just looking to get out and fish with the kids this is great. If you are looking for a hike it's basically a stroll in nature.
101,2016-07-21,['walking'],
102,2016-07-10,['walking'],"This is a great trail for kids.  I'm not sure you could call it hiking.  Half of the times we've been here, we've seen moose just of the trail.  The greasy thing about this ""hike"" is you can take a wheelchair.  Toddlers can walk most of this hike without having to be carried.  This is a very family friendly stroll."
103,2016-07-10,['hiking'],Great fun for the kids!!! Easy hike and way beautiful.
104,2016-07-08,['walking'],Beautiful spot!
105,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"Great for kids.  Good spots to sit for lunch.  Kids saw a moose up close and we're pretty stoked!  Great family hike, does not take long at all."
106,2016-07-02,[''],Easy. Great for little kids and easy walk.
107,2016-06-26,['walking'],Great for bringing guests with small kids to give them a taste of the paradise we live in.
108,2016-06-22,['walking'],"Nice little boardwalk, especially if you have kids with you."
109,2016-06-13,['hiking'],"Went up with my wife and 12 mo. old son to hike the loop. It's beautiful and easy for kids.. The drive is a bit long for little ones, but you can pull right up and park at the loop. Although there are lots of people, it doesn't feel too crowded and people have been respectful with packing in and packing out refuse. A fun, quick Sunday hike for the family."
110,2016-06-11,['hiking'],Great short trail for small kids
111,2016-06-09,['hiking'],Beautiful day up there today!  The snow is almost completely gone from the trail and there are just patches on the mountainside and in the pine trees.  We made it around (with lots of stopping to climb and explore) with lots of small kids and a stroller.
112,2016-06-05,['walking'],"A nice little nature walk, with walkways and a nice trail. We were kind of in a hurry, so we didn't get to enjoy the area as much as we would have liked, but we had a nice little picnic at one of the shaded tables and the kids loved feeding the ducks."
113,2016-06-03,['hiking'],"Not really a hike but relaxing place to get away from the city. Good for kids and picnics. You get to see ducks, nature, and fish in the warmer months.

I went this past memorial day and it was still pretty chilly so bring a jacket. Snow was still on the ground and there were parts of the walkway where it was a big muddy puddle of water. It wasn't a big deterrent for me I feel like this place is most enjoyable in late june, july, aug."
114,2016-05-31,[''],Not really a hike but nice for a walk with pretty scenery.
115,2016-05-30,[''],"Easy, relaxing, and beautiful!"
116,2016-04-24,[''],Lovely walk
117,2016-03-18,[''],"Silver Lake is probably my favorite spot in Salt Lake, and one I have been to many times. I like to go off of the boardwalk there and hike up above the lake for an amazing view."
118,2015-11-30,[''],Nice evening stroll.
119,2015-10-12,['hiking'],This is a great little trail for all and it is really pretty. I was up there on a Sunday in October and the trail was very busy with a lot of people wanting to see the fall colors so therefore there wasn't a lot of wildlife to be seen but apparently there are moose up there every so often I plan on returning in the winter to do some snowshoeing!
120,2015-09-27,['paddle sports'],"A great little lake to go canoeing on. It's a very short walk on a nice wooden walkway. Very family friendly, we passed a lot of families with little children and one other person with a canoe but it wasn't too crowded and that was on a Saturday evening. I didn't bring my fishing pole but a lot of fish were surfacing when we went which was right at dusk. 

There is one corner of the lake that has a lot of long grass but other than that it was amazing."
121,2015-09-23,[''],This trail is absolutely beautiful and easy enough for pretty much everyone. Getting 4 stars because construction is currently going on and has taken out a huge section of the trail to the other lakes near by!
122,2015-09-21,['hiking'],Easy and beautiful. We ran into a couple moose in the water.
123,2015-09-21,[''],"Easy but lots of wildlife...moose, birds, and yes, fish."
124,2015-09-13,[''],"My roommate and I went here last night and it was beautiful on the trail, but as we started off to the right we found a place where we could go off of the trail and do an actual hike. The view from up top was amazing!"
125,2015-08-15,[''],"Can be very busy around Silver Lake. Bathrooms and information Center at the trailhead. Mostly boardwalk. Variety of wildlife including birds, squirrels, weasels, and chipmunks. Great, easy hike even for kids with shade trees around much of the perimeter. Hike up to Twin Lake Reservoir from this trail highly recommended, although it is steep and a solidly moderate hike, sometimes with loose footing. Beautiful views. Variety of wildlife including birds, squirrels, and deer. Fish in the reservoir. Much more challenging. Little children would have to be carried most of the way up. With the beautiful drive up the canyon added in,  this is a pretty tough hike to beat."
126,2015-08-10,['hiking'],"Super easy, wheelchair accessible loop. No dogs allowed. So pretty. Lots of ducklings around with their parents. Large variety of birds and wildflowers."
127,2015-08-06,['snowshoeing'],fun to snowshoe!!
128,2015-08-05,[''],Good time with the parents who were in from out of town visiting and could not handle some of the trail hikes. Let them get out to explore nature.
129,2015-07-19,[''],Gorgeous day! This is a wonderful walk.
130,2015-07-19,[''],Awesome! Great for kids.
131,2015-07-01,['fishing'],"Not a hike, just a boardwalk you can enjoy nature from."
132,2015-07-01,[''],It was beautiful! Not long at all. Easy hike and great for kids. Don't forget the bug spray though.
133,2015-06-27,['walking'],"We love this little ""hike"". It is perfect for our two-year-old. The trail is just long enough to get some good exercise and just short enough that it kept her interest. Beautiful views, serene lake with some nice wildlife along the way. It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but it wasn't too bad when we went on a Monday night. It doesn't hurt that it is so much cooler up there than in the valley."
134,2015-06-22,['hiking'],Wonderful hike! Lots of wildlife! Perfect hike for beginners as there is not much of an incline.  There was still some snow on the trail on the south eastern side of the trail.  Several places to sit down and rest if you need to but be careful the only restrooms are at the trailhead
135,2015-06-21,['hiking'],A lovely walk around a gorgeous lake. Part of the walking is done on a boardwalk. Great for families with young children.
136,2015-06-14,[''],Fantastic views. Easy for kids and the got to see a moose while there.
137,2015-06-11,['walking'],"Easy walk around a a beautiful lake. No hiking required, but there is a trail head to 2 other lakes on the north side of this lake. Great for kids or beginners."
138,2015-06-10,[''],"Super easy, stroller friendly! A nice enjoyable walk around the lake."
139,2015-06-02,['walking'],Nice walk!! Boardwalk around a lake. Busy. There are restrooms but they were closed When we Were there and the picnic tables all Were turned and locked. We went in July of 2014.
140,2014-09-08,['hiking'],Very easy and very user friendly. I love how the trail is boarded for hikers to walk on...its definitely a plus for kids. Enjoyed this simple stroll in mother nature.
141,2014-08-03,['hiking'],Easy hike around a very pretty lake. Nice boardwalks make the trail an easy walk.
142,2014-07-30,[''],"I give this 4 stars based on what it was designed for.   Its a stroll in a park, kinda like Sugarhouse or Liberty Park only much better.  You could go to Sugarhood and walk around the pond gawking at all the lawn sprawlers and fitness aficionados with their painted on running attire and their ear buds, or you could go to the Silver Lake Loop trail. At just under a mile, this lake beats the others for a bunch of reasons.  #1, It's real.  #2, so are the people #3, Its a reminder of just how pretty the Wasatch is.  Yea its busy, if your looking for solitude this is not it.  If you need a place to take your kids or your date for a walk, this is it. Say hello, be friendly, and have fun."
143,2014-07-26,['walking'],Very easy half boardwalk trail. Seen lots of ducks with small chicks. Lots of moose in the area but haven't seen any while hiking the trail.
144,2014-06-15,[''],Nice family stroll around the lake and jogging stroller friendly.
145,2014-06-06,['walking'],"This is a beautiful walk. We've seen deer and moose in the woods near the trail. Very easy walk my family have done several times. In May the Lake and surrounding trail is still covered in snow, parts of the lake and surrounding area is melted, however and one must be careful where you step or you may end up in water. It's hard to tell if you're standing over water or land when it's all covered with snow."
146,2013-08-12,['walking'],"Hiked around the lake with my wife, daughter, son-in-law and grand daughter nice easy walk in a beautiful setting"
147,2013-08-09,['hiking'],Great family atmosphere and well preserved lake area with boardwalks and information signs along the way. Combine this hike with Lake Solitude for a longer evening hike. 
148,2013-07-30,['walking'],"A nice stroll around Silver Lake in a gorgeous mountain setting. This is appropriate for all ages, and is wheelchair friendly, though a few spots may require slight assistance. Plenty of places to enjoy a picnic, yet it can be quite busy on holidays, weekends and particularly hot days down in the valley. Bring your family, camera, and appreciation for an outdoor setting that requires no/little work to appreciate it!"
149,2013-07-10,['hiking'],"I agree that the Silver Lake Loop Trail isn't really a hike.  However, we made a larger loop out of it to Twin Lakes and Lake Solitude.  It came out to 4.53 miles and took us less than two hours.  Out of the three lakes, Twin Lakes was by far the nicest.  The trail seemed easier than the one we did two days ago to Lake Mary & Catherine."
150,2012-09-26,['walking'],"Couldn't say that this trail is a hike. It it's a beautiful walk. Very easy, almost completely level. Great place to see moose and deer."
151,2012-08-12,['hiking'],"Beautiful clear water in a shallow lake.  Lots of board-walks and hand-rails make it accessible to everyone.  Read the placards on ecology and history, or just admire the view.  Great for a family outing, scout outing, or in solitude. 

NOTE: The trail to Lake Solitude and Twin Lakes Reservoir branches off, but is much more challenging than the loop around Silver Lake itself.  "
152,2012-06-09,['hiking'],Really a nice hike and has some great places to camp. 
153,2012-02-17,['hiking'],"Great hike for young people and older people (flat easy trail, mostly hard surface). One large rock for climbing on the south south-west of the lake that the kids loved. Parking is bad during peak times. Lots of places for a picnic. Lots of photo opportunities. My 2 hours was with toddlers."
154,2012-01-09,['hiking'],"Nice trail, with interpretive signs.  Largely wheelchair accessible, though in some sections you may need a push.  There are a lot of options for extending and expanding your hike, but the loop including Lake Solitude is a personal favorite."
155,2011-10-10,['nature trips'],"Went with the Young Men in our neighborhood including my son who is in a power wheelchair.  The boardwalk and smooth dirt paths made it quite easy for him.  It's not easy finding outdoor places he can go, so we really appreciated this trail.  While we were there, we saw a moose wade through the lake, and 2 beavers swimming around.  It was a beautiful day.  

We returned with the family so that my son could do a school report on describing what he perceived with his 5 senses.  That trip was the same as before except that at the end of September it was cooler (we should have brought jackets) and we saw no wildlife.

I've been there 3 times now.  In spite of the crowds, it's a peaceful place."
156,2011-07-06,['hiking'],This trail was amazing.  It was a short walk along a boardwalk.  There was one place we saw some people having trouble navigating it with a stroller because it was still covered in snow!  But the rest really was a stroll along the boardwalk.  We saw some wildlife and some amazing scenery.  Worth taking the kids up and worth bringing the camera up.  
157,2011-04-21,['hiking'],Just a nice stroll around a lake
158,2010-05-16,['hiking'],"Nice get out of the city and go for a cool walk trip. The trail is almost all level.  It's possible to push a big wheeled stroller if you really wanted to. Very busy destination. You will not get peace, quiet and solitude but it will let you feel like you got away from your responsibilities for a little bit."
