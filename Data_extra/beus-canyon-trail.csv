0,2019-08-28,['hiking'],Hike with 3.5 year old. He could have walked what we hiked but wanted to be carried.  Turned around due to a lots of flying bugs.
1,2019-08-23,['hiking'],Nice hike on the lower part of this trail. Hope to be back another day when I have more time to hike up further.
2,2019-08-15,['hiking'],"I hiked this trail today with my 3-year-old and another mom and 4-year-old. We hike up 1.1 miles to the waterfall and back down again (so I can’t comment on the hike as a whole)

We all enjoyed this hike. It went right along the creek so it was cool and fun for the boys. The trail was shaded and interesting with rocks and boulders and things to look at. We saw several kinds of wild flowers. 

This trail is any wide enough for single file hiking and has quite a few turns and plant life, so it’s hard to see down the trail very far. Keep that in mind if your hiking with a lot of people or with young kids you need to keep and eye on. 

Overall, beautiful, interested, well-shaded hike."
3,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"I only hiked to the waterfall (about one mile in), but can’t wait to do the whole thing on a cooler morning. Beautiful lush trail. A bit steep, but good work out."
4,2019-08-11,"['trail running', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'over grown']","Took this trail to the summit of Mt. Ogden. Miles 1-3 are pretty overgrown with lots of bugs, but don't let that deter you from trying this route as the views are absolutely worth it. There is no shade from mile 2 to the summit, so bring plenty of water and use sunblock if attempting this on a warm day. Happy to see the Western Tent Caterpillars have gone away for the summer... those things creep me out!"
5,2019-07-26,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky']","Just complete Beus to Mt Ogden down to Snow Basin.  The Beus part of the trail is getting quiet overgrown with ferns in the lower few miles and scrub oak as you get higher.   Bring a machete.  The trail features a small creek and fantastic views as you get higher.  Once you get above the scrub oak, its a nice trail.  I didn't run into anyone after the first 2 miles."
6,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']",went about an hour up and it was so overgrown I had to turn around. cant continue without a machete. beautiful trail
7,2019-06-15,['hiking'],Watch for rattlesnakes! Almost stepped on one on the way down.
8,2019-06-12,"['no shade', 'off trail', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","I hiked this trail yesterday up to Ogden peak, there was still quite a bit of snow when you get up to about mile 4-5 and then on. it was slow going and difficult but worth it. k came down the Malans Basin trail which was in itself difficult as that trail is not well defined. DO NOT wear short on the Beus trail if you are going up high, the trail gets really overgrown with scrub oak that tore my legs up real bad."
9,2019-06-11,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'snow']","Still very snowy near the top, need proper equipment to pass it! Near the top, before we turned back, we heard a cat of some sort politely asking us to leave its turf. A bit sketchy but it didn’t bother us at all."
10,2019-04-30,"['hiking', 'snow']","Great trail! Snow pack starts at 1.5 miles and we got stopped by the snow after 3 miles. It just got too sketchy for the shoes we brought. Great views once you get above the ridge! If you attempt this while its snowy, proper crampons are a must. Will definately be headed back this summer after the snow melts!"
11,2019-04-21,"['hiking', 'snow']","Hiked earlier this week until I lost the the trail in the snow about 1.5 miles in. The stream was running high, so I scrambled over some rocks rather than cross. You could probably keep going with spikes and trekking poles."
12,2019-04-20,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",This is a nice trail. I ran into snow at 1.48 miles and lost the trail. I will be back...
13,2018-11-16,[''],A little scratchy but a nice trail
14,2018-08-31,[''],We used this route to go get a beer at blues brews and BBQ at snow basin! Great hike♥️
15,2018-08-28,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes but I have seen rattlesnakes all summer on this trail.
16,2018-08-27,[''],"this is a really beautiful hike. the fern forest is kind of amazing. the flowers were mostly spent, but still pretty. trail is pretty tight in some areas, but well worth the work when you take in the views. would definitely do again."
17,2018-08-09,[''],"I wouldn't do this trail again. 

We are in pretty great shape, but my wife wanted to turn back with about 2 miles left because we didn't know if we'd have a better route back down.

I liked how hard the trail was and could have completed, but this trail had a lot of challenges midway through that were not our favorite:

- The swarms of wasps was disconcerting and too frequent for our liking. It made it difficult to enjoy the light stream at all.
- The first overgrowth section was about a mile of swatting bushes out of your face.
- The second overgrowth was several miles in and it was low shrubbery that tore up your legs.
- The scenery and ""wildflowers"" were pretty blah.

If you're going for a challenging hike, enjoy overlooks, and are well equipped for the rough terrain, and don't mind a lot of overgrowth on your hike, enjoy!

*We hiked just under 10 miles total of this trail according to Google Fit."
18,2018-08-01,[''],"Awesome trail, lots of shade. About a mile up it opens up a bit with a ton of ferns that guard the path tightly for half a mile or so. I would like to go all the up and take Malans down. Looks like 10 miles and 4800 ft up"
19,2018-07-19,['hiking'],
20,2018-06-23,['hiking'],Took longer than expected but worth the views. Bring water and snacks. Snowpack made some parts a little challenging.
21,2018-06-22,['hiking'],Really good day hike if you go 1.6 miles and back really beautiful green. Reminds me of a jungle. After 1.6 miles it raps around and fallows The top all the way to Mount Ogden. Warning not much water after 1.6 miles recommend boiling or filtration.
22,2018-06-01,[''],Rattlesnakes are out already.
23,2018-05-02,['hiking'],"Easy to follow trail, overgrown and rougher terrain after the crossing around mile 2. The saddle is 2 miles further than shown, but significant snow fields make the trail invisible for now."
24,2018-04-30,[''],Great hike
25,2018-03-02,[''],no matter the season this is always an amazing worthwhile hike
26,2018-02-04,['hiking'],Good hike. Will try again in the Spring.
27,2018-01-07,['hiking'],I love this trail! Indescribably beautiful in the winter and not a soul in sight! ❤️
28,2017-12-01,['hiking'],"Beautiful and peaceful!  Got stopped by snow after 2 miles.   Not deep, but I’m not equipped for snow and it was getting slick.  Someday I hope to make it to the top!"
29,2017-10-29,[''],"It took me three tries to complete this hike from trailhead to Snow Basin.  First two times I was stopped by the snow and third time finished but ran out of water. Took the gondola down from the top and called for a ride from there.   Beautiful hike but second half is completely open with no trees or shade.  I did this hike in early September.  If I did it again, I would wait until late September or early October."
30,2017-10-08,[''],Didn’t go far in but enjoyed the hike. Sunday was quiet but parking is limited.
31,2017-09-27,['hiking'],Such a gorgeous hike.  It was hard and I only was able to go up about 3/4 a mile due to time but I loved it.
32,2017-09-24,['hiking'],This trails is on my favorites list. So beautiful!
33,2017-08-30,['hiking'],"My lady friend and I hike up Beus to the top of Mt Ogden, then down Malan Canyon down to 27th street. Holy Moly! Will be an all-time hike. Tough but rewarding. The decent down Malan is crazy. We ran out of water above the old Malan settlement. Thankfully found water about an hour later at the spring below Malan. Water is pouring from the mountain and you will hear the waterfall. It's just a little off the main trail. We had an adventure for the books! 11.5 miles, 4500' of vert."
34,2017-08-18,[''],"Pretty difficult trail, I think we got off the trail a little bit but it was beautiful at the top and worth it!! Oh yea a lot of brush and overgrow!!"
35,2017-08-12,['hiking'],So fun and absolutely beautiful!!
36,2017-07-01,['hiking'],"A lot of fun! The trail is overgrown in places, but don't let that deter you. Once you get above the timberline, you are traversing a beautiful alpine meadow with flowers and waterfalls. The view from the top is also great! Bring plenty of water, your total trip will at least take 5.5-6hrs."
37,2017-06-28,[''],What a hike!  I was exhausted after we completed this hike but it was so worth it.  It took about five hours to complete the hike and the gondola ride down to the parking lot was a life saver.  Great way to see how in shape you are.
38,2017-05-15,[''],I got stopped by snow almost at the end. I love this different trail! I did see a large rattlesnake on the way back down. I wish people would keep there dogs on leash!
39,2017-04-19,['hiking'],"Great hike. Sweet views. Still really snowy. The last mile or so - don't go unless you have snow shoes, or a hiking stick/pole. It gets pretty steep and slippery on the snow. Would love to do it in the summer."
40,2017-04-15,['hiking'],This is a good hike!
41,2017-04-15,['hiking'],Took this trail to the top of Mount Ogden last fall. The views were awesome. It's a long hike but worth it if you're in to that sort of thing.
42,2017-03-29,['hiking'],This trail is amazing. I had a great time conquering Mount Ogden. It was challenging and really overgrown at points. I had to crawl under and climb over a lot of brush. Still a whole lot of snow once you get near the peak. Stay safe/have fun.
43,2017-03-09,['hiking'],Great trail. Unremittingly up!!
44,2017-02-14,['snowshoeing'],"this is a fun,  yet challenging hike/snowshoeing trail."
45,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Great hike, I love the views"
46,2016-06-14,['hiking'],"Over grown a bit. Saw a few snakes on the south face, one was a rattler (heard it before I saw it, luckily). Good shade for the first half, then fairly exposed once you get on the south face. Good trail all the way up to Mt. Ogden. Interesting history."
47,2016-05-21,['hiking'],It is such a beautiful trail!! There's lots of variation between steep parts of the trail and breaks.
48,2016-04-22,['hiking'],I hiked this last weekend (4-15-16) and ran into some deep snow about 1.5 miles in. At 2 miles I turned around because I was falling about knee deep with every step. I was still enjoyed the hike and had some great views. I only ran into one other person when I was on my way out.
49,2015-10-19,[''],Hiked to the top of mt Ogden. The views are beautiful. The hike gets pretty strenuous at times but it's totally worth it.
50,2015-06-13,['hiking'],"Great Trail - started at 5:30 am with a group of 12, took the more advanced hikers about 3 hours to get to the top. Saw some deer along the trail. After we summited Mt. Ogden we hiked over to Needles Lodge and relaxed with some chocolate milk and a cookie and then took the gondola down to a waiting car in the snow basin parking lot."
51,2015-06-13,['hiking'],"Great trail! Having the cool stream running next to you was really nice with how hot it was. It was a somewhat long hike, but worth heading all the way up to the Mt. Ogden summit!"
52,2015-05-29,['hiking'],"Great trail! It was a long hike but definitely worth it. I really enjoyed hiking next to the river for the first 3-4 miles. There was still snow at the top, so I was glad I had my trekking poles to help me through the knee deep snow. I made it all the way to the top and had a wonderful lunch on the helicopter pad at the radio tower. The view from the peak was well worth the hike. Overall, I would say this has been one of my favorite hikes I've done."
53,2015-04-14,['hiking'],"This is a great shady trail. It follows a stream for the first half, and is gradual enough for the majority of hikers. Once it leaves the stream, the traffic peters out as it gets steeper. I made it to about 7500 before running out of time, but I will definitely come back to go all the way up to Mount Ogden."
54,2015-02-17,['hiking'],"This is a great hike.  You can take Beaus to the top of Mount Ogden (allow yourself about 5-6 hours round trip to the top and back).  The first section of the hike follows a creek which flows year around.  The second half of the hike is a grueling couple of miles to the summit of Mt. Ogden.   Beginner and intermediate hikers can easily enjoy the first half that follows the stream.  More advanced hikers will be challenged by the extra couple of miles to the summit.  In the summer, you can check to see if Snowbasin is running their Gondolas.  If they are, you can hike to the top of Mt. Ogden, and catch the Gondola down.  You will have to arrange for a ride back to your car, as this will put you on the other side of the mountain (but heck, enjoy a cold beer at one of the beautiful Snowbasin lodges while you wait for your ride!)"
55,2014-02-07,['trail running'],"Nice trail that runs along a small, babbling stream. However, without many, if any switchbacks this is a pretty grueling uphill trek in winter. I was jogging on ice and packed snow which slowed down my progress, but still a nice trail to run or hike."
56,2013-07-16,['hiking'],Pretty scenery and the waterfalls are beautiful. There are rattlesnakes in the area so watch out. I almost walked on top of one when I heard that familiar rattle. All in all though its worth the trip just be wary
57,2012-08-20,['hiking'],Beautiful but gets too grown over towards the top when you pass shoreline in July. It is very beautiful. Watch for snakes. Plenty of birds and water. 
58,2012-07-23,['hiking'],"This is an excellent but very challenging trail to the summit of Mt. Ogden.  It climbs nearly a mile up the West face, first through Beus canyon and then up from there.   For one who enjoys challenging hikes at altitude, this may be the best in Ogden (although N Ogden divide up to Ben Lomond would be another)."
59,2012-05-31,['hiking'],"I really enjoy hiking this trail, ecspecially on those hot days.  This trail offers a lot of cover and follows the creek most of the way.  It is a very good trail with just a couple of spots that have slid into the nearby creek.  It is also a good place to visit in the winter.  I have gone up this trail and crossed over to Burch creek on the way back down.  A nice little loop"
