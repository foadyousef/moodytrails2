Easy and fun for kids to jump thou"
1,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"This is not a 1.1 mile hike unless you take the original trail which only has drop off parking. The trail entrance by the parking area is down about a mile (look for construction and a marked crosswalk, the new entrance is off the crosswalk). At the new entrance, it is about 3.5 mile hike, plus the distance to your car. It is a lovely hike, starts off easy and then takes on elevation at the switchbacks and has a couple spots of hearty climbing over rocks. The lake is pretty and worth the effort. I suggest bugs spray and patience with traffic, especially large groups if you go on the weekend. "
2,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"New trailhead is not 1.1 miles as stated more like 3-4 miles round trip. But I would rate trail as easy with some moderately steep areas that are do-able. Mostly shaded with aspens and pines . Went today 9-2-19 at 9:45 am and no problem with mosquitos or any flying bug. Very popular trail with families of even small kids.  Looks like 3 year olds can do trail no problem.  We are from California, so don’t hike here weekly, but this is definitely a trail I would do again. We started trail at 9:45 am and were back at car by 12:30, and that’s with a good 30-45 min rest to enjoy the lake views. One of my favorite trails !"
3,2019-09-01,['hiking'],"Great hike! Note, the new trailhead is about a mile further up the canyon from the old trailhead. The trail itself is very well shaded with almost no grade until you get close to the lake. There was a bull moose hanging out at the lake that didn’t seem to care about the large number of people and dogs. That being said, be sure to still keep your distance. "
4,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'private property']","Bloods Lake was worth the hike and very scenic. Lots of people. Bull moose at the lake along with lots of dumb people. We made our way from Bloods Lake to Silver Lake and Silver Lake Islet to the northwest towards Midway. Very beautiful,  no people,  but lots of private property.  Bloods Lake old trailhead has no parking!!  Drop off area only. We parked over a mile down the road and had to walk to the trailhead. We discovered the lower, newer trailhead down the road a mile or so....after our hike.  They need better signage for those not from that area.  Great, beautiful hike.  But ticked off at the limited  parking areas.  "
5,2019-08-31,['hiking'],"MOOSE! We (2 adults, 2 kids ages 10 & 7) made it to the lake, were playing in and by the water...  and someone nearby said, ""Moose!"" sure, enough, big bull moose standing in the water! Stayed & watched for a while. It seemed to not care that everyone around was staring, taking pics, etc. Beautiful hike from new parking lot area. Surprised so many wildflowers were still in bloom. Pretty popular on a Saturday, but we didn't mind. Lots of pics for find memories."
6,2019-08-30,['hiking'],Saw a Moose at the lake! Awesome trail.
7,2019-08-28,['hiking'],First time visiting and I was amazed! I will be returning regularly as the views were amazing! the hike was nice with a bit of an incline towards the end but overall worth it. couldn't keep the pups out of the water. 
8,2019-08-27,['hiking'],"Moose on the trail, relatively shady from the new parking area. 3 miles round trip"
9,2019-08-23,['hiking'],Love this trail.
10,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"This is the second time I’ve done this trail but the first on this new route. I broke 5 ribs last week but still had no problem doing the hike. The scenery through the trees is breathtaking and the flowers were out in full force. Only heard a few mosquitos but we had put on bug spray so no problems. We got to the lake and a big moose was hanging out having lunch and then took a nap in the grass. We saw a woodpecker doing its job, and the chipmunks were running around everywhere. The lake is gorgeous but a bit too cold for my son to use the rope swing, which is on the last tree on the other side of the lake if you didn’t know. Maybe next year we’ll go for a swim. Great hike though. "
11,2019-08-23,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","The old parking at the top is now a “drop off only.” There are signs posted discouraging shoulder parking there, also that it is “heavily enforced.” 

The new parking is down the road on the left right after the first crosswalk you come upon. The bathrooms weren’t open yet but there is a honey bucket. No trash can either yet so carry your dogs poop out. 

Trail is much better marked than the last, longer, shady, more wild flowers. Very mellow and flat at the beginning, then switch backs to get up and over to the lake, they can be steep. 

Took my best friend, Dogs, and our two year olds that hiked the whole thing with us, we were slow but they were able to get there unaided. (We carried them down). If dogs aren’t allowed, it’s not posted and there are quite a few of them, also we did swim in the water, hasn’t made the algae list as of now. (8/22/2019)"
12,2019-08-21,['hiking'],this was an amazing hike! the payoff was huge!
13,2019-08-21,['hiking'],Did this today with my 2 year old and 6 year old. They both enjoyed it immensely. Does get a little steep at the end so I ended up carrying the 2 year old. Lake was nice for jumping in so take your swimsuits. It is 3.4 miles round trip. 
14,2019-08-20,['hiking'],Does anyone know if dogs and swimming (for dogs and humans) is still allowed on this trail? 
15,2019-08-20,['hiking'],Love this trail.  Beautiful spot at the lake to have a snack.  The new parking area is great with brand new restrooms.  Walk all the way around the lake.  There was a rope jump into the lake so if interested wear a bathing suit.  
16,2019-08-18,['hiking'],Lovely trail! Completed in the evening light during a rainstorm. Amazing! Super easy and can do within an hour. 
17,2019-08-17,[''],"New trail is partially shaded which is nice. Still a moderate hike, but much longer.
Very crowded on the weekends.  
Wear insect repellent. "
18,2019-08-16,['hiking'],"The trail to Blood Lake shown on All Trails (straight down from Guardsman Pass) is NOT the best way to get there. It is true that you can no longer park right at Guardsman Pass due to renovation. We parked a little over a mile to the east in a large parking area and discovered, fortuitously, that there is now a beautiful trail to Blood Lake from that location. We tracked our progress on the All Trails app and for most of the hike it looked like we were bushwhacking since the trails were not shown on the app. But believe me, you don’t bushwhack. The trail is through beautiful Aspen groves and wildflower filled meadows. It’s a gorgeous trail and yes, the lake is beautiful. 
You can return to your car by the same trail or take the short, steep, loose gravel trail up to Guardsman Pass. From there I suggest you do what we did which was to cross the road and walk a few miles on the Wasatch Crest Trail. Gorgeous views in all directions. 
When you return to Guardsman Pass you will have to walk (or hitchhike) 1 1/4 mile back to you car along the road, steeply downhill (10% grade) with several blind curves. curves. Watch out for inattentive drivers. 
Hiked on 8/15/19 "
19,2019-08-15,['hiking'],This hike was definitely for the books. It’s gorgeous from start to finish. It’s fairly quick. My husband and I knocked it out in two hours and that’s with hanging out at the lake and taking a little dip. 
20,2019-08-14,['hiking'],Nice moderate hike and lots of families. Steeper at the end. The lake is beautiful. 
21,2019-08-10,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail with lots of shade and gentle rolling hills until the last 1/2 mile. Pretty steep at the end, but very doable. Definitely more rigorous than the old trail right at the top of Gaurdsman Pass. Lake is gorgeous .. rope swing was back! Wildflowers were perfect!"
22,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky']",We enjoyed this hike. We went counter-clockwise and the first 0.5-0.75 miles was steep and the most challenging portion of the hike. The rest was quite easy and enjoyable. Pretty easy to find yourself off the trail as it’s somewhat overgrown and there are several very rocky stretches where the trail isn’t well defined.
23,2019-08-06,['hiking'],The new Bloods lake trail is great!! It’s now rated as moderate. The first mile is easy and then the last .5mile is a series of switchbacks and is a little steeper. Shaded most of the way - a great trail now. Wild flowers right now a really nice.
24,2019-08-04,['hiking'],Wild flowers are beautiful! I drove passed Guardman’s Pass and parked a little bit down the hill (maybe 0.5 miles). I think it might be a shorter route to the lake than the parking lot that everyone else is parking at. Bugs are terrible. I wasn’t anticipating hiking so I had no bug spray. They came out in swarms by the lake. Very pretty. A decent amount of people camping or hiking. 
25,2019-08-01,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Went this afternoon and the wildflowers are breathtaking!!!!  But be ready for lots of flying bugs. Bring spray for the Mosquitoes. Even though this trail is longer, its more scenic and shaded. Great hike with the dogs! "
26,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Trailhead has moved a mile down the road, so this hike/trail is much different now and longer.  I would rate it as moderate. A lot of mosquitoes right now."
27,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'bugs']","This is the new trail into bloods lake. It is beautiful but much longer than the old trail. You cannot park at the top  of guardsmen anymore. There is a new parking lot down the hill on park city side with a new trail, 1.5 miles one way, with a good amount of uphill right before you get to lake.  This is a very busy lake because you can swim in it and dogs are allowed on the trails and in the lakes.  I was super annoyed at bag dog owners who left dog poop, dog barf, off leash dogs roaming around. There was a slack line across the lake and also a rope swing."
28,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Hiked this today with three kids under 10. Pretty trail with plenty of shade. The parking lot is large and easy to find (1 mile past Guardsman Pass) on the north side of the road. Bathroom (Honey Bucket right now) is available at the lot. 

The new trailhead is clearly marked and across the road from the parking lot on the south side. The new trail is 2.92 miles round trip with an elevation gain of 373 feet. Kids and older adults may have a harder time toward the end as it inclines fairly rapidly. 

The rope swing was back up this morning and plenty of dogs were on the trail today. Don't forget bug spray!!!"
29,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"There is NO PARKING at the Guardsman Pass Summit. The old parking area has been removed and will be replaced with a Pick Up Drop off area. Parking is not allowed on the road on either side of the summit. The NEW parking area is located 1 mile east of the summit and the NEW trail head is across the street from the Parking area. DOGS are not allowed in Big Cottonwood Canyon west of the summit. So parking below the summit and walking your dog to the summit, you risk getting a ticket."
30,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"A good short hike, easy enough for kids to do. Parking was difficult to find, it was pretty busy when I went. When we got to the lake, there wasn’t much flat land to sit & rest on. The lake was beautiful tho & the water was cold but in a good way. I recommend a ton of bug spray, the mosquitoes were crazy. I’d also recommend a floatie or tube, the lake is huge and swimming all of it can get exhausting. The shores are all rock too, wear sandals. I’d definitely do it again!"
31,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
32,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Fun little hike for a morning workout. The views and wildflowers are lovely. Parking kind of sucks but eh it’s a pre-warm up. Enjoy!
33,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"Very fun, short hike that isn’t too difficult! Good for all ages, especially if you want to swim in the lake!"
34,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Beautiful hike full of wildflowers and lots of shade! We absolutely loved it! Be sure not to forget your bug spray though, the mosquitos are awful! "
35,2019-07-19,['hiking'],"Great new trailhead a mile or so east with PLENTY of parking.  The new trail to Bloods Lake starts across the street, and it is GORGEOUS!  I like that it has ups and downs and level spaces with lots of trees for shade.  Right now you’ll see fields of wild flowers of 7 different colors!  I’m also a big fan of climbing toward a destination and descending back down to the car.  That was what I didn’t like on the old trail—climbing a steep hill back up at the end.  My kids much preferred the old trail because it was super short.  They thought this one was at least “10x as long!”  Despite the complaints on the comparative length, they loved this trail and did great on it.  I have no idea how long it is now, but it felt longish even for me because I didn’t know what to expect.  I’m guessing it was about 2 miles each way.  We had my sister’s dog with us, and someone told us that pretty soon dogs and swimming won’t be allowed.  That’s sad!  But we made the most of it today, taking a chilly dip and swim as a family with our doggie companion.  Seems like lots of families were up there doing the same, but it didn’t feel at all crowded.  Thanks to the family who donated the funds to create this new trail and for those who made it happen!  Only downside—that powdery, dark brown dust you walk through.  Anyone who’s been to Cub Country up Millcreek Canyon knows what I’m talking about.  We came home dirty but happy! (7/19/2019)"
36,2019-07-18,['hiking'],"This hike used to be one of my favorite hikes but due to the new dog policy I will have to reconsider going here. Being a lone, female hiker, I always try to stick to places I can bring the dogs. Really sad to have lost the opportunity to enjoy this place by a responsible dog owner. Swimming will also be prohibited. If you plan on hiking here, clean up after yourself/dogs so we don’t lose our privileges. "
37,2019-07-17,['hiking'],"Great easy hike. Amazing how nice it is only a few miles from town. The new trail is actually prettier than the previous route. We hiked it earlier this week and saw 4 moose in the meadow below the trail. 

Prefect for a quick hike when you have guest in town and want to take an easy hike.  Plus you get to see a mountain lake and maybe some more moose. "
38,2019-07-16,['hiking'],This new trail is great. Its shady most of the way and about 1.5 miles each way from the parking lot. There is a portable toilet at the parking lot too. Kids were happy to play in the water!
39,2019-07-16,['hiking'],"Many, many little baggies of dog waste along the way, which was gross.  Some sections of the trail were really steep and slippery, though other parts were fine. We went early in the morning. It was peaceful and the lake was beautiful. "
40,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'bugs']","MOOSE ALERT! There’s a ton of moose on the new trail. I think it’s because they’re not used to people hiking in that area. Be sure to keep your dog on leash! I will admit to being a person who lets her dogs off leash. My dogs have excellent recalls and I always leash them when I pass people. We went early today so there wasn’t that many people out. My lab actually spooked a moose who was lying in the grass. He leaped to his feet and I frantically called her back to me. I kept them on leash for the rest of the hike and I strongly recommend that you do as well!!

Other then the moose, the new trail is beautiful and easy. The temporary parking lot is expansive so no more stressing over trying to park your car and trying not to slide off a cliff. I’m very happy with the new developments. Enjoy the new trail and don’t be a dumbass who still parks on the road by the old trailhead! "
41,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'bugs']","This is a fun hike for families. It has a lot of foot traffic and although dogs are supposed to wear leashes, many don’t which made it a little difficult for our leashed dogs. There were small amounts of shade throughout but it’s a short hike. There was a steep part going down to the lake and swarms of mosquitoes at the lake but our entire family (dogs included) really enjoyed it. "
42,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"Parking at the top of Guardsman Pass is closed for renovation but there is a new dedicated dirt parking lot exactly 1 mile to the east (toward Park City) on the north side of the road. The new trailhead starts across the road from the lot on the south side at lat/long coordinates (40.6095836, -111.5365965) and is a longer trail with more vertical climb but still doable even with little kids. The trail is well defined, mostly shaded, and beautiful throughout, ending at the opposite side of Bloods Lake from the original/old trail. Apparently the rope swing got cut down but when we visited today there was a snow bank kids were sliding down and someone swimming in the clear water, with the outlet stream running quite briskly along some of the new trail and beautiful foliage and wildflowers everywhere. We only encountered a few mosquitoes except on a small island at the east end of the lake where there were thick swarms that made us run. Overall this is an awesome day hike!"
43,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! I brought my mom and my kids, ages 5m 2y and 6y, this is now a family favorite.  We hiked in from the lower trail head though east of  guardmans pass. lots of bugs! bring bug spry and lots of dogs on and off leash. "
44,2019-07-12,['hiking'],Dogs and I had a great hike. We even saw two moose a little closer than I like! Dogs loved going for a swim!
45,2019-07-12,"['hiking', 'bugs']","The trail head is on the north east side? of the mountain now. Gravel lot on the opposite side of the road. Marked trail and a new, well cleared route up to bloods lake. Great scenery. Tons of bugs. Minimal snow. 
"
46,2019-07-10,['hiking'],I loved this hike!! Everything about it was wonderful! The dogs loved it! Easy hike for anyone! It is steep at the end right before getting to the lake so be careful!
47,2019-07-09,['hiking'],"A fun trail. Slightly challenging, due to steepness. there were a lot of people and flies (especially where people so kindly let their dogs' call-of-nature become nature's duty to clean up). Bring a camera, it is really pretty."
48,2019-07-07,"['hiking', 'snow']",
49,2019-07-06,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']",
50,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'muddy']","Still some snow, but we were able to make it to the lake easily."
51,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'snow']","Short hike with two mini aussies who met some friends along the way to the lake. Worth the hike, dogs got a good swim In before heading d back. Short steep section right before the lake. Good viewaz."
52,2019-06-24,"['hiking', 'closed']","June 22, 2019. Could not do the hike. We drove an hour through Big Cottonwood Canyon to find that the last stretch of road to trailhead and the lake itself is now private property with multiple no tresspassing signs."
53,2019-06-24,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow', 'washed out']",It’s nearly June and the lake is still iced over... so it’s absolutely gorgeous! A bit snowy and the trail isn’t marked well but it’s worth the scramble. 
54,2019-06-20,"['hiking', 'snow']","Super short, super easy. I hiked this on Sunday June 16th. The road to Guardsman’s Pass had barely open the Wednesday before due to late season snow. Trail was snow covered the entire way but we had our spikes. Totally doable. Lots of people making it to the lake. Even more dogs making it to the lake.  Because it’s such a short hike I took my new puppy and it was her first time out in the snow. LOVED it. Lake was beautifully frozen over and thawing at the edges. So many shades of icy blue. "
55,2019-06-17,['hiking'],We did not hike because the trail is still covered in snow as of June 17.
56,2019-05-18,['hiking'],
57,2018-10-29,['hiking'],"Be warned: a good portion of this trail is already covered in snow and ice, and it is slick. Soon it will be impassable without cleats or poles.... or a sled!

Beautiful trail and excellent lake! Great for a lazy Sunday afternoon if you want to get out of the house."
58,2018-10-28,['walking'],Great short trail. The first half mile is mostly flat and then you drop down into the lake. The drop is fairly steep and some older people might have trouble with it but overall a fairly easy hike and the lake is very picturesque and wild flowers were everywhere.
59,2018-10-05,['hiking'],"We did this hike 8/24/2018, and it was gorgeous!  Finally a break from the wildfire smoke.  It is a bit steep going down to the lake, but we made it with only one kid falling on her behind.  The kids couldn’t wait to take a swim in Bloods Lake since most of our hikes are usually in watershed areas.  They LOVED swimming in the lake, and they said this was one of their favorite hikes ever!"
60,2018-10-02,[''],"A little crowded these days, but still beautiful."
61,2018-09-27,[''],Got there at 7 and was able to see the most beautiful sunset reflecting on the lake!
62,2018-09-27,['hiking'],Beautiful lake!
63,2018-09-16,['hiking'],"Great little hike. Go early, or forget about getting a parking spot!"
64,2018-09-06,[''],Great views.  Easy short trail
65,2018-09-05,['hiking'],Great views but not one of my favorite hikes.
66,2018-09-03,['hiking'],we went for the first time this summer with our Pub for her first swim water is really cold most of us all got in.... what happened to the rope swing ?
67,2018-08-17,[''],"Just visited today, hike is pretty easy until the steep part right before the lake as others have mentioned. The GPS location I got from AllTrails kept trying to make us take a private road on someone's property so I recommend stopping at the parking lot at the top of Guardsman Pass. Out of the 6 of us who swam in the lake only 1 found a leech on them so enter at your own risk!"
68,2018-08-13,['hiking'],Easy and short hike but it gets rocky and steep at the end. It was crowded and there were lots of dogs. I went there on a Sunday at 4:00pm. I saw some people swimming and fishing . Overall nice hike
69,2018-08-10,[''],What happened to the rope swing
70,2018-08-09,[''],"Pretty short and easy hike until the last bit as it gets a little steep/rocky right before the lake (still doable for kids or beginners though). Went on a weekday around 2 pm and it wasn’t crowded at all. Great views, great for swimming, and dog friendly!"
71,2018-08-08,['hiking'],"Beautiful lake, just a short hike from the trailhead. Would definitely recommend getting there before 10 to avoid the crowds and get decent parking. The hike down to the lake is short, but a bit steep towards the end. There are several other trails on the opposite side of the lake if you want to explore further. Rope swing isn't there as of today, but the lake is still very swimmable. Lots of trash along the popular swimming spots - please respect nature and pack out what you pack in ✌"
72,2018-07-16,['hiking'],"It was nice and short with some great views and pretty wild flowers, but there were a lot of people and mosquitos. My friend went on a week day and it was warmer, we went on a cooler day on the weekend. I recommend doing that if you want the place to your self and fewer bugs."
73,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"I wouldn’t classify this as an easy trail, though it’s certainly doable for inexperienced hikers. Make sure to go in the morning. The lake draws a lot of swimmers."
74,2018-07-15,['hiking'],Wonderful time! Get there early to avoid crowds and traffic! Looked like people camp there too.
75,2018-07-14,['hiking'],Easy hike with beautiful scenery. Watch out fo dog poop and doggie bags all over. There was plenty of trash at the trailhead too. Please clean up after yourselves and your dogs.
76,2018-07-13,[''],Beautiful weather. Beautiful trail. We enjoyed this hike with our kids. The rope swing into the lake was refreshing!
77,2018-07-11,['hiking'],I found a hat and sunglasses up near the top of Guardsman Pass on Sunday 7/8. If they are yours message me describing your items and I can get them back to you.
78,2018-07-11,['hiking'],Mosquito central bring spray
79,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"Nice, short hike to a lake which is great for anyone ( kids, novice hikers, visitors not used to altitude) to get to (did this w my 6 year old flat lander nephew with no problem). Flowers have been gorgeous this past week. Could make this a longer hike by extending it beyond first lake. Plan ahead for what type of hike: if nature and quiet go in lower traffic hours - weekdays and/ or early morning, if you don’t mind a crowd w plenty of dogs, people, and activity you can go any time."
80,2018-07-07,['hiking'],
81,2018-07-02,[''],"Beware! This place has now become Grand Central Station for families with young kids and teenagers partying. It’s not a backwoods hike at all anymore. It used to be one of our favorites - we would take the dogs for them to go swimming. That was back when it was private property and people didn’t know about it. But now it has become discovered – you know it’s bad when the forest district has put Porta potty‘s at the trailhead. If you’re looking for loud music, kids screaming on a rope swing, and an incessant flow of idiots hiking in flip-flops and swimsuits, then this is your trail! If you’re looking for an actual nature experience avoid this at all costs. There are so many better places to go. And if you do take your dogs, per the other comments here, please clean up after them and be a responsible dog owner."
82,2018-06-28,[''],"The lake was beautiful. The wildflowers are in bloom. The mosquitoes are thick - be prepared with some bug spray!! Took 8 kids under the age of 8, they all did great but the 8 year olds lead us down the wrong trail and it was a little steep and slippery.  We watched a few other groups come in on the wrong trail too."
83,2018-06-28,[''],Easy hike with amazing views. Wildflowers are blooming now!
84,2018-06-25,[''],Easy great reward with the lake very pretty .
85,2018-06-25,[''],the lake was a wonderful treat!!
86,2018-06-25,[''],"Great for kids - our 5 and 6 year old did it without too much trouble, and a beautiful view at the beginning and the end."
87,2018-06-15,[''],"I saw people hauling the trash out, and the trail and lake were clean and pristine!"
88,2018-06-11,[''],Perfect family trail - great for kids - extraordinary views. Parking can get a little crazy - go early on the weekends for best experience!
89,2018-06-10,[''],I’ve seen leaches in the water before. So be careful.
90,2018-06-10,[''],Short and easy. Passed many bags of dog poop left from the day before. How hard is it to pick up? Pretty lake.
91,2018-05-27,[''],This is a fun place to go but if your going up for the rope swing you’ll wana know A few things 1. There’s a weight limit I wana say anyone over 220 pounds better be able to hold them selfs up and grab the rope from higher up because the branch dips a lot more then you think it will  2 it’s on a steep hill with cut down trees that look like spears so keep your feet up 3 try to get as far out into the lake when swinging there’s like a huge rock so make sure you clear it my brother didn’t and said he crumbled when he landed like a tin can 4 not for kids 5 it’s pretty freaking sweet swinging on some mildly dangerous rope swing into a pretty lake it’s amazing and fun af we set up hammocks brought out a canoe and had a blast I’m not sure about camping there but I’ve seen people camping there enjoy the lake guys
92,2018-05-27,[''],Loved this trail. Brought a cousin of mine from NYC and she enjoyed it. A pretty easy hike despite the steepness towards the end. Will return with my dog next time and maybe come back to fish.
93,2018-05-09,['hiking'],We tried. Road gate is still closed. Walked the road up to the TH- still lots of snow and ice.
94,2017-11-14,['hiking'],Did a loop up to the first peak then down around the lake. It was good.
95,2017-10-30,[''],Brought my pup and it was a great hike! Snow up there and great to walk around the lake!
96,2017-10-08,[''],Great quick hike to a peaceful lake .
97,2017-10-05,['hiking'],"Great, easy hike. My 2 year-old walked almost the whole way. It is super muddy and icy...but still fun! I will be doing this one again next summer with all three kids."

99,2017-09-05,['hiking'],"Easy out and back trail leading to the beautiful Bloods lake. Rocky trail descending to the lake. Went on a week day when it was not too crowded, and we found a shady spot to sit and dip our feet in the icy water of the lake.  Would be a great picnic spot."
100,2017-09-02,['hiking'],"This is a hike to a beautiful and large lake, but the last .2 mile or so is really dangerous. I went down on the left trail and up on the right and both are terrible. Not safe for little children at all. They need to redo this trail so that it is safer. Switchbacks or something would be better than just going straight down and straight up.It's also really loud at the lake. Lots of people swimming, which I don't mind, but it's all the streaming and yelling and barking that bother me. Wish this was further off the road so that maybe not so many people would come."
101,2017-08-20,[''],this trail is no longer private property and is now owned by the public after we raised $13 million to stop the industrialization of the area! strict NO TRASH rule
102,2017-08-18,[''],Love this trail! We picnicked down at the lake. It's very steep right before getting to the lake. I had a baby in an ergo and my husband had our toddler in a backpack and we had to hold hands while walking down the steep area just to ensure neither one of us slipped. I wouldn't let kids wear sandals walking down it. After the lake we ended up hiking up the mountain and over to lake lackawaxen (not sure if that is spelled right) and that is a TOUGH hike. Especially with baby/toddler.
103,2017-08-13,[''],"Short hike to a beautiful lake. Tiny bit of a steep scramble right before the lake, but nothing too challenging. I've got a bum knee, and had a one year old on my back in a pack, and did not struggle at all. Scenery was beautiful."
104,2017-08-13,[''],"nice short hike, plenty of gorgeous wildflowers."
105,2017-08-06,['hiking'],Great easy trail for the kids. Took my 5 and 7 year olds and they did just fine! Beautiful lake you can swim in. One of my favorites!
106,2017-08-04,[''],So fun. Just a short steep section that is a little difficult for little kids but a fun challenge for them too. Beautiful lake at the end.
107,2017-07-27,[''],"Breathtaking views right at the parking lot. It's not an easy trail, though -- it's short, but the steep descent over uneven ground right before the lake wasn't ""easy"" on the way back up...at least with a thirty pound pack, it wasn't easy for me! Beautiful wildflowers, great place for the kids to explore. There's a sharp drop off for the first 50 meters of the trail, then the rest I'd say is kid-friendly. Drive up was a bit scary, FYI. No shoulder, narrow two lane highway, sheer cliff!!"
108,2017-07-23,[''],"Very short, easy hike with a lot of people and dogs at the lake. The wildflowers alone make it worth it though, so beautiful. We plan on going back and hiking up to Lackawaxen next time!"
109,2017-07-19,[''],Easy short hike for littles. Just make sure to bring the bug spray! We kept hiking past Bloods up to Lackawaxen. The flowers are so pretty right now.
110,2017-07-19,['hiking'],"Short and easy hike into the lake, love that its dog friendly. The wild flowers are SO stunning right now!  However, I've been going consistently the past week or so and the mosquitoes are terrible! We started to hike down to Silver Lake and I had to turn back because I was getting eaten alive. Wait until the mosquito season has calmed down before camping or hiking! Or just slather on the bug spray."
111,2017-07-04,[''],"I'd give it four stars but for all the irresponsible dog owners who leave bagged dog crap on the side of the trail ""to pick it up on the way out."" It made the trail look so trashy: there must have been two dozen bags on the way in. I don't get to leave my trash next to the trail to pick up on the way back. These dog owners shouldn't be able to do what they do either. I don't dislike dogs. Just selfish dog owners who don't care about anyone else trying to enjoy the trail."
112,2017-07-01,[''],Beautiful wild flowers and alpine lake.  Mostly easy hike with a steep descent to the lake.  LOTS of people and dogs.
113,2017-06-26,[''],Very short hike if you just want to get out with your dog or small kids who can't hike too far.  Beautiful scenery.
114,2017-06-20,['hiking'],Did this with my 6 year old in late June. She got to hike and play in the snow. We both loved sitting on the island looking for wildlife. Short but spectacular hike.
115,2017-06-09,['mountain biking'],
116,2017-04-23,['hiking'],I've been here 2-3 times and it's always beautiful and I only saw maybe a couple other people. Not too busy at all! The dogs loved it and really enjoyed splashing in the lake.
117,2016-10-23,[''],"Beautiful trail, but get there early. It's not very serene after 9am."
118,2016-10-23,['hiking'],"I have mixed feelings about this one. 3 stars because it really is  beautiful, I'm not denying that but it's SOOOOOO busy and dirty! It's short and simple. Lots of people. Lots of dogs. Lots of garbage. Honestly it's truly sad to see how the land (which is private property) has been treated and how it currently is being treated. It's infuriating to see people, old and young not give a crap! I just can't with society sometimes. I don't think I'll be doing this one again, anytime soon."
119,2016-10-20,[''],Good place to bring dogs
120,2016-09-19,[''],Very short walk. Then somewhat of a scramble to the shore of this very pretty walk-around lake.
121,2016-09-03,['hiking'],was a beautiful trail for walking...; stunning views and great for dogs!
122,2016-09-01,[''],"Nice and easy, the bugs were terrible. Save this for fall :)"
123,2016-09-01,[''],Great little hike! Perfect for a beautiful drive after work and then a small trek to the lake. I recommend walking around the lake too.
124,2016-08-22,['hiking'],"Nice short getaway. Don't expect to burn a bunch of calories, but the lake itself is very pretty!"
125,2016-08-18,['walking'],"Not really much of a hike, a lot of trash and debris :( The Lake itself is spectacular and worth the trek to snap some awesome pics"
126,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"Bugs! Besides that it was grand! A beautiful little lake, nice to swim in as well!"
127,2016-07-10,['hiking'],bugs. watch out you will get bitten. loads of people looking to cool off. I always bypass blood lake and continue on to one of the others.
128,2016-07-08,[''],thank you Debra!
129,2016-07-08,[''],"short and sweet. Beautiful views the entire trail. Steep section as you get closer to the lake. Make sure littles have good grip on thier shoes. Those with achey knees would benefit from a walking stick.
wild flowers, a lake? What's not to love!?"
130,2016-07-07,[''],am I being ignored? twice I've asked if my 2 Laborer Retrievers are welcome? who do I call to get an honest answer?
131,2016-07-06,['hiking'],"Busy for mid-day Tuesday, but not too bad. Aside from us there was 4 other small groups around the lake. My 5, 7 and 9 year old did fine hiking in and out. Bit of a hike up to get out, but well worth it. It was 90 degrees in Midway and upper 60's/low 70's at the lake.  Have bug spray on hand for sure."
132,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Pretty cool little hike, nice rope swing on the far side of the lake and good trees for hammocking"
133,2016-07-01,[''],"Fairly easy trail for my 5 yr. old and 8 yr. old, although there are some steep parts coming back up from the lake. There were mosquitoes everywhere! We couldn't even stay at the lake more than 5 minutes because we had about 10 of them landing on us at any given time. We hiked back to the car as quickly as we could. It is a pretty hike and a beautiful lake. Maybe a different time of the summer would be better."
134,2016-06-29,[''],"I am thoroughly confused!!! is access the Bloods Lake accessible or not?! I am a naturalist and ALWAYS carry a bag to pick up stray litter.
can I or can't me and my fur baby go????? HELP."
135,2016-06-29,[''],nice easy trail for my 7yr and 4yr old. mosquitos near Lake were the worst I've ever seen and drove us away quickly! but it was still pretty
136,2016-06-24,['hiking'],"A short, easy hike with kids. The trailhead was full, but we didn't see many others along the trail."
137,2016-06-23,['hiking'],Good short trail and pretty lake. Dirt trail is tricky in the steep spots.
138,2016-06-05,['hiking'],"My vet told me about this lake. so, is it or is it not dog friendly?
I was required to rate it in order to post, although I haven't been here yet.
I got confused when I read the last post.
all I want is a place I can take my fur baby swimming!"
139,2016-06-04,['hiking'],"Beautiful little Lake that is on PRIVATE PROPERTY!.  The wonderful owner of the land & lake was nice to leave it open for us to to hike ,swim etc for a long time however due to people who left garbage, camped extensively, built fires during hot fire season and basically disregarded nature and the fact that it is HIS property NOT PUBLIC PROPERTY, has posted it as No Trespassing, Private Property. The State has given him the right to prosecute ALL who enter.  Some *!@*!&% people tear down his signs, but as hikers it is OUR responsibility to check out if it is public or not.  Personally I don't want people camping and leaving garbage in my front or backyard, do you?  let's PLEASE respect his property as we want others to respect ours!  So even IF you see others hiking it with no apparent problem please have some respect.  Hike on over to Lake Lackawaxen!"
140,2016-05-30,[''],"I love it in the summer time. The steep snow this month caused a few problems, my Max and Rai loved it but my older dog Harrison had a real problem with the snow we didn't even make it to the lake. "

142,2016-04-20,['hiking'],"Unless we were missing something - we couldn't get to it via car, because Guardsman Pass is closed.  Bummer"
143,2016-02-18,['paddle sports'],"Not highly regulated area-- very quiet without too much traffic. 

The lake is nice and small, and clean. If you go to the Southeast corner there is even a rope swing. We took $5 tubes and floated to the other side in less than five minutes. Great for a quick afternoon dip on a hot day.

Also, great sunrise views if you're camping overnight. No facilities or plumbing though, so pack out whatever you pack in."
144,2015-10-05,['hiking'],The lake at the end is worth the trip.
145,2015-10-05,['hiking'],"We did this hike back on September 7. Google Maps pretty much took us right to where it is. When you get there, there is a little dirt parking area on the right. Park here and the trail begins where you see the large sign just to the south of this little parking spot. 
Went with my husband and 2 kids who are 5 and 7. They did splendidly, it's a little steep right before you get to the lake but such a quick hike and the kids loved it. Some people were slack lining and some were taking a quick dip in the lake. Lots of people with dogs but they were all well behaved and my daughter asked the owners if she could pet every one. Great hike for a family."
146,2015-09-27,[''],"Very easy trail. It's pretty much straight down into the lake. My puppy was more interested in the chipmunks vs the lake and the trail around the lake was limited, because of all the campsites are right next to the lake. We walked through two of them to get around the lake. My puppy and I continued to lake lackawaxen which made up for the lack of actual ""hiking"" portion to this one. Will do it again, cause I really enjoyed lake Lackawaxen."

150,2015-09-02,['walking'],"The lake was beautiful. The giant pines surrounding the lake made it even better. I definitely recommend swimming, even if it is a little chilly. 

Also, a few ""No trespassing"" signs were posted, but we (and the several other people there) had no problems!"

152,2015-08-08,[''],"Easy family and pet friendly hike, for all ages really. You go down to get to the lake and then hike up to head back to the parking area. It was fun to dive in even though it was a little colder than usual for early August today. Totally recommend this one! :)"
153,2015-07-27,['hiking'],"If you go, look for the rope swing on the other side of the lake and swing in. The water is refreshing. Also, the wildflowers are incredible."

155,2015-07-16,['hiking'],"This is a very pretty trail, short and sweet. You will find a lot of people on this trail."
156,2015-07-13,['hiking'],Short n sweet trail easily done. High traffic but not too bad considering most of the touring visitors stay at the vistas on Guardsmen Pass. Even fewer make their way past Bloods Lake to Lakawaxen Lake :). Dog friendly as this is the 1st stop after the SLC watershed in Big Cottonwood.
157,2015-06-14,[''],"This was a beautiful, short hike!"
158,2015-06-01,['hiking'],"Super easy and quick hike. I love this area and usually get to the lake via Peak 10420, Clayton Peak and Lackawaxen Lake. If you've got the time definitely take that tour. If not, you can be to the lake and back in under an hour from the parking area at the top of Guardsman Pass. Dogs are allowed at the lake. Lovely spot. The trail was covered in snow in a couple spots but was quite doable regardless."
159,2014-10-26,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail as part of a loop that started up to peak 10,420 then dropped down to Lackawaxin Lake. Then to Silver Lake and Silver Islet Lake before climbing to Bloods Lake. The hike up from Bloods Lake to Guardsman pass start steeply then levels off as you approach the trailhead."
