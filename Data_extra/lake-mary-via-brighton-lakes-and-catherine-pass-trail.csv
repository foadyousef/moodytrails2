0,2019-08-06,['trail running'],Did as a loop starting at the Milly lift over past twin lakes and twin lakes pass; down to Albion basin; then to the trail over the  pass by Catherine and down.  The stunning views are mostly behind you as you climb but it's a nice trail and worthwhile.  The climb isnt really bad at all. 
1,2019-07-15,['hiking'],really pretty hike! glad we went early morning it was starting to get crowded when we were on our way down around 10am
2,2018-08-08,['hiking'],"Great trail! Prepare for a workout, especially in the beginning. View was great!"
3,2018-07-30,['hiking'],"this is a fairly steep trail, but definitely worth it!! Lake Mary is really beautiful."
4,2018-07-22,['hiking'],3 Star because The trailhead location is mis-marked in AllTrails.  If you use the “directions “ function in AllTrails it directs you to the Catherine pass trailhead above Alta.  This is the incorrect location as you need to start this trailhead at Brighton.  The hike from the Catherine pass trailhead is much shorter roughly 1.5 miles to the top of the pass .  At that point you can go back down to Catherine and Mary lake but you are doing the trail backwards.
5,2018-03-25,[''],Beautiful hike! The scenery up top is worth the climb.
6,2018-01-20,['hiking'],Nice hike with three lakes to enjoy
7,2017-09-21,[''],Honestly too many rocks
8,2017-08-01,[''],"Went in the fall after the drought. Expected to see a lake, not a few ponds. Saw pictures from this year where the lake is filled up again and looks pretty"
9,2016-10-05,['backpacking'],"Good moderate hike. We camped at Lake Mary. I don't think they allow swimming here though. Still enjoyed the sights, though!"
10,2016-07-10,['hiking'],this is the long way to get here... but if you want a longer hike go for it
