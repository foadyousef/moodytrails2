1,2019-09-05,"['hiking', 'blowdown', 'over grown']","Not a bad trail, it is 2 miles uphill to the pass. Mostly over grown and trees blown down. You can see where the foresters cut the fallen trees off the trail.  Once near the top you get beautiful scenery. 

Was confronted but two adolescent moose bulls."

3,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"Fun trail, shaded most of the way, so great after work hike!"
4,2019-08-22,['hiking'],"I have Pulmomary Hypertension I wasnt able to make it all the way to the top. it is very challenging for me but I love every step.

update. 
attempted it again, made it up to the saddle. HELL YA!!"
5,2019-08-20,['hiking'],"I enjoyed this trail. The incline increases as you go so it’s a good challenge. You’re surrounded by beautiful greenery and shade the whole way so that always helps. Because it’s deeper in the forest, definitely wear bug spray. I went on a weekday and only saw two other hikers while I was out. The only thing I didn’t love was when you reach the end, it’s quite overgrown which obscured the view of the valley. Otherwise no complaints."
6,2019-08-09,['hiking'],"I hate to overexpose this hidden gem, but it is a great trail because it is easy access from the SL valley and has little traffic on weekdays.  The wet Spring and recent rains have left the trailside lush and green.  "
7,2019-08-04,"['trail running', 'over grown']","Really like this shady trail, though it is definitely overgrown in the top section. Overall a good trail for a hike/run and minimal people. A bonus for me personally is that dogs are not allowed, which decreases the number of people on the trail and the occasional trail droppings."
8,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'over grown']","Trail’s okay. Pretty crowded on the weekends but very accessible for something quick and it’s nice to get out and see something new. I’d like to do this again and take the Millcreek pass down for a change of scenery. After that, I probably won’t go back again. "
9,2019-07-19,['hiking'],This trail was great to get out of the heat of the city. Not busy and filled with wildflowers. 
10,2019-07-18,"['hiking', 'over grown']","like others said it's pretty overgrown but still easy to follow the trail. I would recommend pants since the brush was rubbing on my legs the whole time. the bugs were a little bothersome as well I would bring a bandana next time because I hate bugs flying by my ears. but I liked that it was pretty moderate, quiet, and had a nice view at the top"
11,2019-07-18,"['hiking', 'over grown']","Beautiful wildflowers, good climb and nice view at the top. "
12,2019-07-11,['hiking'],This is an okay trail - there are better ones around. The trail is a bit overgrown in places. Mostly shaded and gets a little steep in sections during the last half mile. Okay view through the tree down mill creek canyon. 
13,2019-07-09,['hiking'],Our three instruments said that the trail is one-half mile longer than the sign says.  It is beautiful.
14,2019-07-06,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Great wildflowers!
15,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"The wild flowers are spectacular now. Shaded and beautiful hike, we doubled our fun because we found it totally worth going up and over, down the other side, then reversed back. Took us about four hours. Parking is tight. Good idea to carpool."
16,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"This was my first time hiking the trail.  It was overgrown in some places and had several moderate inclines, but provided great views of the Salt Lake Valley at the top."
17,2019-06-28,['trail running'],"The road is open.
Vegetation is pretty dense and almost encroaching on the trail, but the trail itself is clear.  "
18,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'blowdown']","The road is closed so add another 1.6 miles each way. Gorgeous hike, breathtaking views, few snowy patches and a section of large downed trees. We started on the Millcreek side on the Mt. Aire trail to the Lamb’s canyon trail and went all the way to the Lamb’s Canyon road trailhead and then back. Total RT 11 miles. Perfect day. No dogs allowed. "

20,2019-05-16,['hiking'],Fantastic view. Poorly marked.
21,2019-05-12,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'snow']",Largely snow covered but a beautiful hike; Lambs side lost the trail; Millcreek side not bad
22,2019-03-27,['hiking'],"Snow too deep after about a mile or so in.  Road still closed so ya gotta hike to trailhead.  Still beautiful and quiet up there, bummed I forgot my hammock at home cuz I coulda stayed there a long time."
23,2019-02-17,"['hiking', 'snow']","We didn't hike the trail.
We hiked the road.
With the gate being closed, you have to go approx 1.6 miles to get to the trail head. 
Even though we didn't get the chance to hike the trail, it was still beautiful. The road was well packed. Microspikes recommended but not mandatory. I used my snow shoes just for fun.
We were going to keep going past the trailhead but we ran into a young bull moose and had to turn around. 
The road is good for cross country skiers.
I would like to do the actual trail but will wait until the gate reopens."
24,2018-12-17,['hiking'],"The gate to the Lambs Canyon TH is closed for the season. It adds another mile or so onto the total distance. About a quarter till the end snowshoes would be helpful. We didn't use them but they would have been nice. Lots of sinking in the deep snow. We only saw 1 other person on the trail. Gradual climb, hardest part is towards the end. We were in snow so don't know what it would be like without."
25,2018-11-10,[''],"Humid and buggy in the summer. Nothing worth the hassle at the end. We did see a moose, but that's the only interesting part of the hike."
26,2018-10-18,[''],Had to turn around and drive to another trailhead because NO DOGS ALLOWED! But looked like a great trail otherwise.
27,2018-09-26,['hiking'],"Great steady incline. I don’t think I hiked it all bc I lost service. You go through some beautiful aspens, then up to a peak where you can see mountains all around. Excellent hike for the fall! Good trail for dogs too. Not crowded at all since it’s up towards the top of Millcreek."
28,2018-09-12,[''],Definitely on the hard side of moderate! Beautiful right now in early fall
29,2018-09-07,[''],Good hike! Incline all the way up for a good workout. Trail was easy to follow. I enjoyed this trail - nothing amazing but it was pretty and the leaves are just starting to change.
30,2018-08-26,[''],"I rate this a moderate to hard. It was steep indeed. Rewarding the entire way up. Smells amazing! We were able to escape the smoke from California And got some fresh air:):)
Great hike."
31,2018-08-24,[''],"It was beautiful but very over grown, loved  the babbling creek. At times the trial was very over grown and no where to take a break."
32,2018-08-14,[''],"Ended up being about 4.75 miles out and back
saw mama and baby moose near beginning, steep!"
33,2018-07-31,['hiking'],Easy going hike with some beautiful scenery along the way up. The saddle has a decent view of surrounding mountains.
34,2018-07-31,[''],"Beautiful views, but the overgrown bushes made it difficult to even walk through it. Does it ever get maintenanced? Also, saw a momma mouse and her baby about 25 ft away from me, so that was my cue to quietly descend and go back home. If you’re into those kinds of thing, then let this trail be the first on your list!"
35,2018-07-15,['hiking'],
36,2018-06-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, especially at the beginning when the trail follows the stream. The wild flowers were gorgeous! While not particularly steep, this trail is more of an endurance game. The fallen trees mentioned in previous comments have been cleared recently. The summit view wasn't much to write home about, and there was nowhere to sit and take in the views (either at the top or on the trail). Definitely glad I went once, probably won't do again. :)"
37,2018-06-21,[''],Hard work on way up. But beautiful forest views and satisfying finish
38,2018-06-20,['hiking'],"The gate was open, and the trail was lush and green. A few downed trees are still on the trail. Hollyhocks and wild roses can be found."
39,2018-05-26,[''],The gate isn’t open quite yet but that just makes for a nice quiet trail and a good warmup before the trailhead. There was a bit of snow before the saddle and a few adventure obstacle logs across the trail. Beautiful hike today.
40,2018-05-05,['hiking'],Gate still not open on May 5th. Water running nicely.  Moderate grade up.  Nice and green right now.  A little wet. Some snow on trail. A couple trees on down across the trail. At about 1.5 m there are a couple trees down and a fair amount of snow.
41,2017-11-19,['hiking'],Gate closed so hike was longer than expected with a 6yo.  Quiet and forest trail is lovely.
42,2017-10-27,[''],"Gate is closed. Forest service has a sign saying “closed due to icy road conditions”, but this is BS. THERE IS NO ICE ON THE ROAD!!!!  Suspect it is closed to reduce hunter traffic in the Canyon.  I have been up this road several times when it actually is icy or snowy.  Hike up road 1.5 miles to reach trail head."
43,2017-10-26,[''],"A little muddy and icy in spots. Gate up to trailhead was closed, short walk up to trailhead. Great views"
44,2017-10-17,[''],Great hike up through the mountains.  The trail in many spots kicks up in grade and was kind of steep. This time of year the trail has a little snow on it and was a little icy. We took our 8 year old daughter and she did just fine.
45,2017-10-17,['hiking'],"Pretty wet, and muddy. Was still a beautiful hike, some parts had a little snow."
46,2017-10-01,['hiking'],"We only went in about 1.5 miles of the trail. Going up is a little strenuous but not too bad. We gained 1,100 feet in this trek, but going up was not steep, it seemed gradual. It was more of a dirt trail than a rocky one, which seems to make it less strenuous. The views of the mountain were great as we got to see fall colors today!"
47,2017-09-06,[''],We saw several moose!
48,2017-09-04,[''],luv this hike.. but I don't like bees... nope or red ants.. but other then thAt luved it!
49,2017-08-26,[''],Beautiful hike Love it I would do it every day if possible
50,2017-08-19,['hiking'],Awesome hike !!! A great workout
51,2017-08-16,['hiking'],"We loved this hike!  We are in our late 20s and my husband wears our baby.  We are beginner hikers so we weren't able to make it all the way, but we did get far enough to get some great pics of the valley.  It is very shaded in most areas.  We liked the level of difficulty.  It is harder than walking through the park, but not too much to handle.

On our way down, we saw a rattlesnake coiled up, facing the corner of a switchback.  Luckily another family saw it first and warned us.  We ended up having to cut through some brush to avoid it.

We plan on coming back, but I will definitely keep my eye out for rattlesnakes next time!"
52,2017-08-13,[''],So beautiful. Steady grade. Very well maintained trail. Nice amount of shade. Great view from the top. One of our favorites!
53,2017-08-11,['hiking'],Really loved this hike. It's very shaded and has amazing views along the way as well as at the top. There are some steep parts but overall not too challenging if you're in decent shape. Saw quite a few small snakes as it got later in the morning. Beautiful wildflowers everywhere too!
54,2017-07-18,['hiking'],Great hike. Beautiful wildflowers. Some parts of the path had vegetation that was a bit overgrown but it didn't cause a problem.
55,2017-07-16,[''],Great hike that doesn't take too long. It's has a great view of the valley!
56,2017-07-15,[''],"Moderate, but at the high end of it. it was nice to have the stream as a marker so that we could hear how close we were to the bottom. The views of the valley were awesome and we had no idea there would be so many different wildflowers in July."
57,2017-06-28,[''],The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars and not 5 stars is because of the 3 snakes we saw on the trail! Not a fan of snakes! But the scenery was great!
58,2017-06-26,[''],"All of the information we found about the length of the trail was different. Ended up being a total of 4 miles (still debatable). Wonderful views though and a great hike! Tough for first timers, but not impossible."
59,2017-06-24,['hiking'],great hike. But it's not 3.8. more like 4.75. we ran into someone who mentioned they redid the trail and added more switch nsvks a while ago. But. wildflowers are everywhere right now. gorgeous!
60,2017-06-19,[''],So beautiful!! The wild flowers are starting to bloom!
61,2017-06-18,[''],Great hike. No dogs allowed
62,2017-06-09,['hiking'],"Hi!  I love this hike, just wondering if anyone knows if the road is open yet?  Thank you!"
63,2017-05-15,[''],Awesome hike today. Around 9 miles from the gate to summit and back. Lots of down trees and snow still up there.
64,2017-04-23,['hiking'],"Went to do this hike, but the gate is closed. Looks like it would be about 1.5 miles just to get to the trailhead. Decided not to do that. I gave this 4 stars to not lower the rating because I haven't done the hike, but wanted to let people know that this is not accessible yet."
65,2016-10-14,[''],Loved this hike. Definitely got my heart pumping. Beautiful views!
66,2016-10-10,['hiking'],Excellent short out and back hike to view the fall colors in the first two weeks of October.  It only takes 2 to 2.5 hours at a casual pace with rest stops.
67,2016-10-08,['hiking'],tried to hike this trail.  all trails did not say dog friendly however one of the posts stated they had taken their dog. be aware...this is a watershed canyon and your dog can not even step outside your car. public enforced as well as fines if you are caught.
68,2016-09-19,[''],Great little Sunday hike. It is shady with a moderate grade. One of my favs!
69,2016-09-06,['hiking'],This is a beautiful hike. I've started it a few times before but just completed it for the first time. This hike is more like 4.25 miles out and back instead of the 3.8 stated.
70,2016-09-05,['trail running'],"Really lovely jog/hike.  lots of shade and vegetation, not too steep, and isolated.   Still had quite a bit of snow in the upper reaches when I hiked it in Spring 2015."
71,2016-09-04,[''],Very nice trail for carrying baby and have dog off leash... Steep enough to get heart going and water most of the way with good views of gobblers nob to mt Aire towards the top
72,2016-07-09,['trail running'],Nice ascent on a steep but doable trail.  More like a trail jog/hike.  Pretty views from the top.  The seclusion and views outweigh the few areas of heavy growth over the path.
73,2016-07-08,['hiking'],Although this trail has some nice water along its length it also is overgrown in many places and the bugs are pretty aggressive. Bring plenty of bug repellent as you'll need it to ward off the pesky insects who buzz around you constantly. The trail is not steep but climbs constantly so unless you are used to the altitude and climb you'll be taking a few breaks along the way.
74,2016-07-08,['hiking'],This may be my favorite hike! It's nicely shaded and not too trafficked during the week. It also has beautiful views of the valley from the top. Take your bug spray!
75,2016-06-30,['trail running'],Shaded trail with little traffic and beautiful vistas. Easy access from SLC.
76,2016-06-27,[''],"Quiet, relatively shaded and easy grade all the way to the top."
77,2016-06-20,['hiking'],"I love this trail for an after work hike, it is heavily wooded and is cool down in the canyon. It is a nice leisurely hike with a view of the city at the top that makes for a great sunset."
78,2016-06-18,['trail running'],"Love this trail.  Never busy, always shady, and I constantly see moose on the trail."
79,2016-06-10,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike through dense woods to an overlook of Salt Lake valley. Pretty steep and a lot of logs on the trail but overall a good, quick hike."
80,2015-11-09,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail in a light dusting of snow, although was wearing the wrong pair of shoes and was slipping on the way down. Saw a half dozen deer. 1h45."
81,2015-10-27,['hiking'],This is a great trail to hike with kids. It is not to steep but does offer some challenging spots for the kids. Not very many people on the trail so you can really enjoy the sounds of the mountain. I would recommend this trail to everyone and look forward to hiking it again.
82,2015-10-26,['hiking'],"A bit hard for children, but nice. No great views but peaceful. Moose are easy to see, but we din't."
83,2015-10-03,[''],"Loved it!  Great foliage, shade and view at the top.  It was a bit dense in certain parts but part of its charm."
84,2015-08-22,['hiking'],"I thought this hike was just OK. It's a pretty trail with a number of short switchbacks but I was expecting more when I got to the saddle. The view into the valley is alright, not as impressive as some of the other hikes around. The sign at the trailhead said the distance was 1.5 miles to the saddle but my GPS said it was 2 miles. I was glad I did it but I probably won't do it again. I only passed a few people on the trail so it's a nice, isolated area. The incline on the first mile is steady but easily doable. The second mile is a bit steeper but still doable. This would be a good one for trail running. It's pretty smooth the whole way, no big rocks to trip over. Took me an hour to hike to the saddle, 28 minutes to run down."
85,2015-08-03,['hiking'],"Loved this hike, arrived 11:30 am on a Saturday .  Glad there was a lot of shade and the trail was the best I've been on in the past 100 plus hikes.  Beautiful  greenery all around that's very thick and teaming with butterfly's , bees and flowers.  Yes it's steep, 1500 foot climb in 2 miles but it's an even assent with several switchbacks. Great cardio workout with not many other hikers to crowd the trail. The trail was so smooth that if I was a trail runner I would have really enjoyed launching myself down the mountain side. Actually several hikers were doing just that, a steady hike up and then a fast descent . I would have rated this hike higher but the view down into the salt lake valley from the top of mill creek canyon was not as good as I was expecting.  The round trip took us 3.5 hours but can easily be done in 2.5 if your in shape. We had lunch and took more breaks than we needed."
86,2015-07-24,['hiking'],"Great hike! Path is a little over grown towards the top but it was well worth the view. The wild flowers are gorgeous! Hardly anyone on the trail, I passed 3 people total on the trek."
87,2015-01-12,['hiking'],We went to do this hike this past weekend with our dogs in tow.  Turns out that the trail is in a protected watershed area so no pets allowed.  Thought this info may be helpful for some reviewers.
88,2014-09-01,['hiking'],"Lamb's Canyon was a great half-day hike to feel like you are out of the city, but it only takes twenty minutes to get there. 
It is a semi-thin trail in some areas and there were a few places were it got a bit steep (so as someone with chronic weak ankles, I wish I had brought some hiking poles for the descent), but otherwise it was great. 
There is a creek that runs near the trail for the first part, which is so nice."
89,2014-06-21,['hiking'],Good Hike limited parking. Hiked over the summit and down to mill creek canyon
90,2014-02-23,[''],"Great secluded trail.  This was the first trail I hit in Utah...coming from the flat land of South Carolina, it was memorable to say the least.  Late October brought a light snow fall that day and even though it was beautiful, the snow made the trail a tad muddy going up steep inclines. It was a great workout nonetheless. 
If you're looking for a off beaten path that has thick vegetation, streams and moderate elevation....this is a must."
91,2013-10-06,['hiking'],This trail has beautiful trees lining most of the way.  Hiked around 3 miles of this trail as we have young kids.  Nice and quiet.
92,2013-08-14,['hiking'],"Uphill all the way one way, and downhill all the way back.  Shaded about 75% of the time by a tall canopy of trees, this is still a demanding hike that is terrific for the intermediate or advanced hiker.  Climbing 1500 feet in less than 2 miles, you get a good workout but, even on hot days (it was about 85 degrees today) you're protected from the sun most of the way.  If you want to have lunch, there aren't any good rocks or downed trees to sit on, so better to make this a morning or afternoon hike without lunch."
93,2013-08-08,['hiking'],"Nice shady hike through dense wooded area. Not much view to speak of until you reach the saddle, and then it's a mediocre view. Access is along I-80, but this trail connects to Mill Creek Canyon as well. Great workout hike with some rugged terrain. "
94,2013-07-21,['hiking'],"Simple enough for us to do, was cooler but very humid. Listening to the stream & hidden streams along the way was very relaxing. Lots of flies! No bug bites but they do swarm you (we forgot spray). Some muddy spots on the trail added a little fun! Very beautiful tall trees."
95,2013-07-15,['hiking'],I love this shady trail. I hiked it in July and any time I want a respite from the valley heat. Lambs canyon is  around 20 degrees cooler than the valley and this hike is a very shady trial with a very Columbia Gorge feel to it. A couple hours out of the high temps of the on a hike is great.
96,2012-08-24,['hiking'],Wonderful hike that ends with a view of Parleys. Very green and humid when we hiked it and it was a lot of fun. There were no other hikers and it was so quiet and relaxing.
97,2012-01-12,['hiking'],"Beautiful forest/creek trail. Depending on the season wildflowers, wildlife, and colorful foliage. Can connect with Elbow/Mt Arie trail out of Millcreek if you are willing to hustle vehicles around.  "
