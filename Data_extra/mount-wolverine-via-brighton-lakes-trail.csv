1,2019-09-01,['hiking'],"Pretty easy hike actually, I would rate it as moderate. "

3,2019-08-12,['hiking'],We started in Brighton to Catherine's Pass. Great climb up to Tuscarora and then over to Wolverine! Made it a nice loop by following the ridge to Patsy Marley and then connecting to the Twin Lakes trail. Great ridge hike with awesome views the whole way. We clocked it at around 7 miles and 2200 feet in elevation gain. 
4,2019-08-11,['hiking'],I clocked 6.86 miles and 2037 vertical. It took just under 4 hours with plenty of breaks and some time at the top. 
5,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Moderate hike with a lot of mosquitoes!
6,2019-07-16,['hiking'],"Lovely hike and really could be classified as a more moderate hike. There is some very light scrambling... I’d say some minor Class 2 spots. But the end view of both Albion Basin and Brighton is spectacular! As of July 14, 2019... there are still a few patches of snow to walk across. Be careful, but they are still doable! "
7,2018-07-29,[''],"Took the Catherine Pass trail up to Sunset Peak, then swung down and came up this trail from the Pass. It's a great way to bag 3 peaks in one morning, and you get some of the prettiest views around!"
8,2018-07-29,['hiking'],"17500 steps. high traffic until you get to the spur leading to mt wolverine. ez pz until you get to that trail. it is hard to follow for a first timer and had to keep consulting the map. its steep at parts. lots of jagged rocks to climb over. the view is spectacular looking over little cottonwood canyon alta, brighton, solitude, guardsmans pass etc. I wouldnt do it again. I prefer trails with lots of tree canopy and this just doesnt have it."
9,2018-07-26,[''],Climbed from lake solitude to twin lakes pass and up wolverine cirque. Great views from the top into LCC and Brighton. The climb up wolverine cirque is not for people who are scared of heights.
10,2018-07-23,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Love hiking to the 3 ladies, I mean lakes. Decided to bag a peak this time - Mount Wolverine. Some scrambling over rocks but worth it - spectacular view!"
11,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"Amazing views. After Catherine’s pass, the crowd definitely thinned out. I went almost an hour without seeing anyone. The trail also gets a little confusing in a few places after that, but it’s there. I had to really look for it a couple times. A little bit of scrambling up rocks... or a lot. Lol. It was a great workout, too. The whole hike was absolutely gorgeous. I also love that it starts at Brighton where you don’t have to worry about finding a place to park! The total round trip took me four and a half hours."
12,2017-10-30,[''],"Great hike. A little strenuous on the Ridgeline decent above Twin Lake. Snow is scattered in north exposure, up to knees in some area."
13,2017-09-17,['hiking'],It's rated hard for a reason but it's worth it!
14,2017-09-11,['hiking'],"We started at Silver Lake, up to Twin Lakes. Patsy Marley, Wolverine, Tuscarora, and Sunset. Made it a loop and came down Brighton Lakes. We were going to do Millicent from Wolverine but we hiked down a ways and decided we didn't want to go that far off the trail. Next time! It was a fun hike, nothing technical but there is some rocks you can climb if you have to release your inner child. :)"
15,2017-07-16,['hiking'],"Hike to Lake Catherine and the saddle above it is fairly easy, but you're doing some light scrambling on a sometimes barely-there trail for the first part up to the peak.  Gorgeous views of both Big & Little Cottonwood Canyons and good shots of all the Brighton Lakes."
16,2017-07-01,[''],"Awesome trail! Did most of it, but too sketchy to go to the peaks. Was able to go to Sunset Peak instead. Lovely views from up there too! Still lots of snow, but would recommend! 5 stars, just didn't make it to the correct peak!"
17,2016-10-29,['hiking'],Good trail to Catherine Pass. Easy to follow rocky path to the peaks. great views almost the entire route. Saw many deer the first three hours of daylight and had the trail mostly to ourselves until we got back to the trailhead
18,2016-09-08,['hiking'],This was a great hike that lets you see a lot of the area including lakes and peaks.
19,2016-08-19,['hiking'],"It's a great trail, but if you want to snag another peak while you're at it go to Mt. Millicent first. Hike up the access road that takes to you to Twin Lakes. Continue on the road past the lakes to the top of the ski lift. The boulder scrambling is easy and summiting Millicent provides a great view of the Brighton area. Continue down Millicent on the SW side and follow the ridgeline up to Wolverine. The. head SE from Wolverine and visit Tusc. From there head towards the Brighton Lakes area and use the Lake Mary trail to get back to the Brighton Parking area."
20,2016-07-09,['hiking'],I tried to approach this by hiking up to Twin Lakes and then going up via Mount Millicent and doing this route the opposite way as a loop. My hiking partner took one look at the steep boulder field going up to the top of Millicent and would not continue the hike. If you are comfortable scrambling up steep terrain and would like to make this into a loop I would go up via Millicent and descend via Catherine Pass. Going down Millicent would be even more unpleasant that going up.
21,2015-09-15,['hiking'],"We were wandering around the top of Catherine's Pass and ran into a ranger who recommended following the ridgeline back down to Alta. It was a long hike but worth every second of it! You will need to be prepared for it! 
We spent some time scrambling and just enjoying the fall colors and being able to see both Cottonwoods. I definitely recommend starting in Little Cottonwood and making a loop. There's a boulder field you will have to scramble down to get back to the trail. We saw lots of deer once we made it to the forest. If you stay to the east side and follow the creek bed down you end up just below the Alta Memorial Grave. If you follow the trail on the west side you'll end up at the base of Alta."
22,2014-09-30,['hiking'],Alta Basin hikes are always beautiful.  We approached this one from the summer road in LCC and could hear the music coming up from Oktoberfest on the top of Mt. Wolverine.  Will visit the area again to send it up Sunset Peak and Pioneer Peak.
23,2014-06-26,['hiking'],"While this can easily be done in the same day along with Sunset Peak, I feel it deserves a spot of its own as I wouldn't suggest this for younger family members or those who hike infrequently. If you think the views at Sunset Peak are amazing, they are even more spectacular from Mt. Wolverine imho. No scrambling required, but snow skills are suggested for early spring and even into the first days of summer on good snow pack years. This is an easy jaunt to knock off two 10k+ peaks in one afternoon for sure! Fun hike!"
