I’d like to clarify the mileage discrepancy between AllTrails and the review that said it was longer.  From the Donut falls parking area we measured 2.8 miles to the summit.  But it’s 0.6 miles to the point where the steep, somewhat overgrown single track trail splits off from the 4WD road that the hike starts on.  From the start of the single track trail it’s 2.2 miles to the top.  So the AllTrails distance of 4.4 miles round trip is correct only if you start measuring from the beginning of the single track.  
All in all, a great half day hike.  Plenty steep, really good workout, tremendous views from the peak of the central Wasatch.  Look forward to doing it again!"
1,2019-08-31,['hiking'],"A bit overgrown in the first mile or so, but overall a stunning and beautiful trail. Incredible bang for your hiking buck, especially if you  get parking near the doughnut falls trail head. there are probably 3-4 places where you have to cross a chute or Rocky path that you will want to be careful and slow, but other than that, fantastic steep and challenging hike. Took about 1:10 to get to the top and a bit more to get down with some picture taking."
2,2019-08-29,['hiking'],"Great hike and a great workout, even for Peakbaggers.  I think I'll petition for a name change  for this beast.  ""Killer"" Peak instead of Kessler.  Happy hiking and be safe. The view is definitely worth it."
3,2019-08-28,['hiking'],"Like others have said - overgrown, then REALLY steep. Difficult footing, but worth it for the views. "
4,2019-08-21,"['hiking', 'over grown']","First half mile is pretty overgrown. gets steep quick after. view is worth it, and only saw 2 other people. at the peak trail disappears, have to stumble up the last bit. "
5,2019-08-18,['hiking'],A little overgrown at the bottom but trail is in great overall shape.  Trekking poles would have been a solid idea.
6,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Steep trail that oddly seems steeper on the walk down; recommend shoes with good ankle support for the descent. Lower sections have slight overgrowth over good quality packed-earth with some deadfall. The last mile is characterized by some patches ofd loose earth and rocks up to football-sized, becoming persistent near the summit. A short section of class II scrambling is optional in the final 50m to the summit. Trail was mostly shaded from 1530 - 2000; insects and mosquitos were not a factor. "
7,2019-08-09,['hiking'],This trail is longer than 4.4mi. We started from the upper parking lot that is shared with Donut Falls and had to stop before reaching the highest peak due to a time restriction and had already reached 2.8 mi. I forgot to turn off the recording when I got in the car because we were in a rush so my total mileage isn’t accurate. I would guess the distance from car to peak and back would be around 6.0-6.1 miles. It’s a steep and steady incline the whole way. Have plenty of water and snacks at the ready!
8,2019-07-28,['hiking']," This hike is not for everyone. It is very strenuous at times, but the views are pretty awesome along the way. It was not the most spectacular hike, but if you love a good up hill challenge it's well worth it."
9,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"Giggled at the writeup below with the emphatic language about the steepness of this hike.

Yes, it is steep.  No joke.  Your legs will tell you so.  And you will believe them.

The trail is pretty easy to follow.  Some deadfall on trail.  One 6ft long snow patch.  Summit is very nice and is worth the effort.

"
10,2019-07-20,['hiking'],Beautiful views from the top of Kessler Peak of all the other peaks in Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons. Steep hike but good trail. Having hiking poles is a good idea for hiking to ensure you don't slip or slide down the steep trail. 
11,2019-05-05,['hiking'],"Mother of god prepare your muscles and your lungs and your blood sugar. This is steep AF. Cool, exposed views at the top to explore but damn"
12,2018-10-30,['hiking'],I didn’t find the views really worth the effort on this one. It’s a short punishing hike for sure.
13,2018-10-22,[''],"Such a stunning view. Well worth it, very steep. Add 2+ miles since the road is closed and you have to walk to the donut falls parking lot. Quite a bit of snow for the second half!"
14,2018-09-09,['hiking'],"We were looking for a short hike that was challenging, and we definitely got it with this one.  The hike is pretty much a climb. No scrambling, you’re just constantly going up. The view at the top is amazing, and you can even see Twin Peaks from there. Fitbit tracked 7 miles round trip, so the mileage on the app is misleading. Took us 4 1/2 hours total, including the 30 minutes we spent at the top."
15,2018-09-02,['hiking'],The trail is steep most of the way. The overgrowth is mostly after the turnoff by the cairns. Overall a very good trail up towards the top with a great 360 view. Mostly shaded.
16,2018-08-28,[''],"Pretty hike (really a CLIMB!) with shade and lush foliage to the top. It’s a beast though, all the way up and down. Loose rocks and dirt, we slid a couple times so be careful. Very pretty at summit!
Apple Watch clocked nearly 7 miles round trip and 4,500 foot elevation gain!! So, much longer than the app says. Took us 4 hours because you have to be very careful going down. 
When you cross bridge over creek, walk west behind the trail sign then left on service road till you see cairn on right, maybe 200 yards, then go up!"
17,2018-08-17,[''],So lovely. Challenging!
18,2018-08-16,[''],Standing on the peak as I type. Going down may be a bit treacherous. That was the steepest 2 miles I have ever hiked up.
19,2018-08-14,[''],"Awesome hike; great views at the top and well worth the steep elevation gain.

Hiked up and ran down from the First parking lot: 2:39"
20,2018-08-11,['hiking'],"A relentlessly steep hike, and once at the top, the smoke created a haze that made it hard to enjoy the view. Nevertheless, it's a great hike and an even better workout. I took 3 liters of water and ran out by the time I was at the bottom."
21,2018-08-07,[''],"Steep in sections, but nothing too technical.  You aren't likely to see anyone else once you split off from the Donut Falls trail.  The views are great, I recommend it!"
22,2018-08-05,[''],I’m officially addicted ... 7 peaks in 7 weeks ... Mt. Kessler was a “shorter” one but gains elevation RAPIDLY ... Watch for the Cairn on the right when you are on the Service Road or you’ll think you are on the right path but are actually on private property ... 
23,2018-07-25,[''],"The trail is a tad overgrown at the beginning, but nothing too bad. This hike is decently well shaded for the first 2/3 of the trail as well. As the other reviewers stated, it is steep, but has an amazing view from the top and is great for getting away (only saw 1 other person)."
24,2018-07-19,['hiking'],"Kessler Peak was definitely a hike to remember. Probably one of the more difficult hikes I’ve done in Utah. Glad we went in the early morning because by the time we were coming down, the sun was shining quite a bit. Great views from the top!"
25,2018-07-17,['hiking'],
26,2018-07-07,[''],"Steep but well worth it. Didn’t see a soul the entire hike after the turn off, so would recommend a hiking buddy and good hiking shoes. There’s a lot of loose dirt and rocks towards the top near some drop-offs."
27,2018-05-27,[''],Great hike.
28,2017-10-11,[''],"Trail is beautiful right now. Snow starts to pop up intermittently around the halfway point but it isn't too bad. There's a decent stretch that crampons would've been helpful for, but for the most part a pair of good grip-y shoes will be fine. Super steep, though. Pretty much the entire way up. Zero signage though, so double check on the map here to make sure you're staying on track."
29,2017-10-05,[''],"The trail was steep, muddy and a tad snowy, with not much of a view. However, the view at the top is absolutely bonkers."
30,2017-09-29,['hiking'],Steep and slippery but fantastic views.  Some snow and mud.  Even with a hiking pole I slipped several times.  Better than neffs for city views.
31,2017-09-25,['hiking'],great steep hike.
32,2017-09-11,[''],"Here are some more specific directions:

Park at donut falls parking lot and begin walking the donut falls trail as if that's where you are headed. Continue along the trail until you cross the creek over the bridge. At this point you will be at a fork in the trail. There will be a trail sign for donut falls pointing to the left as you face it. Walk west, past and behind this trail marker for donut falls. You will immediately hit a service trail, it is wide and can't be missed. Turn left, head up the trail approximately 250 yds. You will see a trail on your right headed up the Mtn. It may be very overgrown in the spring. This is the trail to Kesslers peak. And it's hard as hell. Very steep throughout. But great views at the top."
33,2017-09-03,['hiking'],"Great trail, especially if you like the steep uphill stuff. 

Bring your poles!"
34,2017-09-02,['hiking'],"If you do not like heights and crossing open slopes, it is not the hike for you!  Take poles, take water, wear good hiking shoes. Loved this hike though I did not bag the Peak. I am a saddle bagger. This a steep climb and as you near the top you have open slopes, greater views, a beautiful sloping meadow of wild flowers, and 2 open mines! Go early and park at Donut Falls. Head west along the road and over the creek and pass through the gates service road. Follow the road a bit,. When you hit the Y in the road keep right. The trail head is unmarked and on your right. Lots of  shade and some old pine groves! Enjoy!"
35,2017-08-25,['hiking'],"A very strenuous steep hike.  

Descending was a bit tricky as some sections of the path have loose soil with rocks on top."
36,2017-08-06,[''],Awesome hike with great views.  Some really steep parts made going down a little tricky...with an 8 year old
37,2017-08-01,['hiking'],"Did this with my 8 month old in a backing pack. It was a little cold for her at the start so I should have brought her warmer clothes. It was steep! We initially missed he trailhead, but once we went back and found it he trail was well cleared and easy to follow. The trail wasn't crowded at all. We got there at 7:20 and I would recommend that because by the time we got back the parking lot was full of people doing donut falls. It was a weekday in early August. No snow."
38,2017-07-09,['hiking'],"Hiked this today, July 9th. As of now, there is no snow field to pass through. You can see the remnants of it, but it is passable. When you reach the snow/ first avy area, you have around1.1k feet to the top. I saw two mines. The fist appeared stable; it's only around 150ft to the end and around 30ft deep. I didn't have an ascender and didn't want to get stuck in the second one. Anyone have any idea how large it is?

The main route contained no scrambling that I saw. It was a constant pitch, but not overly difficult. I found it to be easier than Olympus as a reference.Shaded most of way - which is nice. I fifth the opinion that the initial trail head is easy to miss; however, Suunto has it on their terrain map if you have one of their GPS watches.

Quick hike; moderate difficulty; worth the hike"
39,2017-07-05,['hiking'],"This was a great hike!  Be sure to get an early start if you plan on hiking this trail any time over the next couple months.  I decided to start my hike early in the morning and it still ended up being fairly hot by the time I got back to my car.  The snow on the north slope wasn't much of an issue and should be gone within a couple weeks.  Be prepared to work for it over the last bit of this hike, as it becomes fairly steep on the final push to the ridge.  However, the payoff/view at the peak is more than worth it."
40,2017-07-04,['hiking'],"Great hike to get away from people.  Snow field was only about 70 feet to cross today, and was a bit sketchy, especially on the way back, as the sun had warmed it up.   Peak was great, last KM was super steep and a bit rough."
41,2017-06-22,['hiking'],"As noted previously the trailhead is easy to miss. If you were to keep going straight from where the Donut Falls trail intersects with FR019 you'll see it. Don't have too much to add to the previous reviews. Pretty steep, but you'll be alone and the views are awesome. I turned around at the snowfield because I wasn't comfortable crossing it and I was a bad hiker, alone without telling anyone where I was. Would have laid there for quite awhile if I slipped haha. Will definitely be back in a few weeks when the snow is all the way out."
42,2017-06-19,['hiking'],"Where the trail splits off from the road is easy to miss if you're not looking for it. It looks just like a dried up run off bed.  There's just one big snowfield left still as you traverse the north side of the mountain before you  the final climb stretch up.  Yaktrax and poles would have made it a lot easier to cross, but I just crossed it in my normal hiking shoes and using my hands for added help. Views from the top are great!"
43,2017-06-12,['hiking'],"Great hike near Salt Lake City. I would recommend this only for experienced hikers/canyoneers who are in great shape. It is difficult and at times quite steep. We went in early June. A lot of the upper trail was covered in snow and some of this was at very steep areas, so the trail was overall pretty dangerous when we went. Towards the end of the trail, there was just too much snow so we instead just scrambled up the rocky mountainside to the top of another peak that was a little bit off the trail. The views are beautiful and it is a great workout. Saw a lot of scat but no larger animals along the trail. Hiking poles are a must. If you are thinking of going when there is likely still snow, I would bring good snow shoes. It's worth it!"
44,2017-05-29,[''],Probably the Steepest trail in the Cottonwoods
45,2016-10-03,['hiking'],"Although at some points it was pretty steep, it was a really nice hike. Recent rain storms have made the soil of some parts of the trail damp which creates a slipping hazard. Watch your footing and use trekking poles if you have them. Some parts I even had to do a bit of scrambling. Also not there are a few large fallen trees on the trail but they aren't too hard to get past. Be mindful of the altitude too! If you start getting a headache, turn back! 

The views at the top of the mountain are fantastic. I loved this view of the twin peaks mountains. In the end, there's a lot of reward for such a short hike."
46,2016-09-21,['hiking'],"yes when they say steep, they mean steep... BEAUTIFUL hike..."
47,2016-09-16,['hiking'],Very steep hike but well worth it. 360 degree views from the top and a couple of cool mines and broken down mining shacks. I definitely passed where the trail splits off for Kessler Peak because it really does just look like a stream bed so pay attention.
48,2016-08-24,['hiking'],"Quick elevation changes, some areas are very steep. recommend trekking poles. way worth it!"
49,2016-08-18,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! Steep but nothing too extreme. Initially followed the Donut Falls trail until a fork to the Cardiff  Road...actually had to head down the old mine road towards the trailhead a bit to meet up with the Kessler trail. Trail was extremely overgrown for probably the first mile or so. I completed the hike the third week of June and there was still some snow in a couple of spots which made things a little sketchy. Getting to the summit wasn't bad. There are some spots with fairly loose rock and steep drops, so watching your footing is key in those areas. Views from the top are fantastic!"
50,2016-08-16,[''],Steep in places for sure.. Didn't see another soul at all.. You might mistake the beginning of this trail for a creek bed..
51,2016-08-06,['hiking'],"Great hike, took 2.5 hours to the top.  People aren't underestimating when they say steep!"
52,2016-08-01,['hiking'],"LOVED IT. The hike was steep, which is probably why we did not encounter anyone else on the trail. Took us two hours to the top but it was well worth it."
53,2016-07-05,['hiking'],It was crazy steep with lots of loose rock which made it difficult. Because of that I don't know if I would do it again but it had amazing views at the top you could see everything.
54,2016-06-20,[''],"Steep the whole way, so be ready for that. Very steep near the top, but keep going, because it's very worth it. 2 miner's cabins and 2 mine shafts near them on the top half, keep your eyes out for those, very cool! You think you're at the top when you hit the ridge but still a couple more minutes of climbing, don't let that false summit trick you! Gorgeous 360 degree view at the top! Still one snow patch to kick across, but there are some good footsteps there for you to follow."
55,2016-06-19,['hiking'],"People are not kidding when they say it is steep!!  Not many flat places to camp along the way. My favorite trail so far on the Wasatch.  Minimal  exposure. Unbeatable views. Not many hikers. I know of a guy who runs it almost every day. His record is 38 minutes.  It took is about 2.5 hours to the top. Hiking sticks are mandatory if you are older or have knee issues. We did it on a Saturday and hardly saw anyone, although Donut Falls below was a madhouse."
56,2016-06-11,['hiking'],Great hike. I would say steepness would be a 9/10. First mile or so of trail is narrow and pretty overgrown. A few snow spots of about 10 yards wide or so that you have to kick in to get across. That was no snow on the true summit. Enjoyable hike. Great views in all directions from the summit.
57,2016-06-10,['hiking'],"Definitely a challenging hike. My gps showed it at about 5.2 miles round trip. Most of the snow is gone now, only 2 small areas where you had to cross slowly and kick into the snow a bit. We made it all the way to the summit in a little less than 2.5 hours."
58,2016-06-04,['hiking'],Didn't quite make it.. got all the way to the saddle but was WAY to sketchy to finish. Had to use spikes the last mile or so and it was pretty steep. should have had an ice axe with me. Will go again to bag her right though!
59,2016-05-14,['hiking'],Sill snow on the upper last mile of the trail. Used snowshoes towards the top but was difficult because of the steepness. Turned back around 3/4 of a miles reform the top at a traverse that was to steep and risky to continue.
60,2016-04-08,['hiking'],"Nice and steep, great views on top. When you go down it's fun to detour into Donut Falls."
61,2015-11-21,['snowshoeing'],"Loved this hike after last weeks snow. It's steep, has dense pines in the middle section. Snow was untouched and because its a deep trail it was easy for follow since there was also a depression in the snow. The trail follows a ridge in the middle section presenting view through the trees. The only thing that went wrong it that we ran out of time and had to turn back about 3/4 of a mile from the top"
62,2015-10-03,[''],If you want a work out this is the trail! Non stop steep elevation gain.
63,2015-06-21,['hiking'],"very easy to miss trail. Head up the road past the gate. When the road forks stay to the right and then start to look for a narrow trail that goes straight up on the right hand side.  This have VERY few spots that level off. It varies between steep, very steep and very very steep. But it was awesome.  I would recommend it if you have strong legs and good cardio.  Not one single other person on the trail the whole time. oh - and it's not 2.3 miles total - its 2.3 miles to the top alone."
64,2015-06-18,['hiking'],"Trail is pretty easy to miss. You need to get off the Donut falls trail right after the bridge/stream about a half mile up the trail (there's a small trail that goes up to a wider trail that almost looks like a small dirt road.) Then head up that trail, but watch very carefully on the right for a skinny trail heading up into the woods. Once you find it, it's nice dense woods for most of the hike up, but it's crazy steep. The nicest thing was not seeing anyone else on the trail! The conditions are fine. There were only a couple very small patches of snow remaining."
65,2014-06-15,['hiking'],"Loved it! I'd recommend this one to anybody who's in decent shape and ready for views to die for, and the possibility of seeing some really diverse wildlife. I was actually surprised to see 5 other people (2 groups), heading down as I was just reaching the first mining encampment, but I reached the summit alone and never saw another soul until I got back down to the Cardiff Road. I didn't see any water sources (there may be), so I'd suggest taking plenty just in case. I would not consider this for anyone looking for just a casual hike! I'll be adding this one to my spring list, absolutely!"
