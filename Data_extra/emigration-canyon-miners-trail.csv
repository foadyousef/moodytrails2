1,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"Not much shade so don’t go in the heat of the day! But a lovely walk on rolling hills for most, overlooking layers of foothills. Super steep and overgrown right at end."
2,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"Really flat, really exposed and hot."
3,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"First part is mellow then the incline happens and is pretty steep for the rest of the trail. Thick foliage this time of year. The trail ends by splitting up into two trails and that's it. No view, just biting flies."
4,2019-07-01,['hiking'],"Such an undiscovered gem in Emigration Canyon - we only saw two other people walking. No mountain bikers, no other dogs. Started trail at 8:45am and made it about 2 mi until I needed to turn back. No water for the pup, but peaceful - alternating shade/sun along the way. Parking area is about 1.5 miles up the road from the Pinecrest turn off - see pic. "
5,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"This is a great trail for half trail run half ""peak bagging"". The first 1.5 miles to the stream is very mellow. Stream was flowing great for the dog to get a drink before heading up 1000 ft elevation gain in just 0.5 miles or so. You follow the ridge for gorgeous views of the canyon and valley. You do walk down towards a Meadow. I did get off trail a few times so make sure to follow the map. Great 360 views at the top. I was the only one on the trail between 8am-10:15am on a Saturday morning!"
6,2019-06-22,['hiking'],"Beautiful wildflowers, sweeping views, quiet  and very few hikers.   Loved it.    The trail is in great shape —not muddy and not dusty.    "
7,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'washed out']",Did this hike today. Wasn’t to bad when it wasn’t flowing with water. The beginning trail is muddy and a lot of water. Took the trail to the right and came across a couple boards that went across a deep stream. The beginning part of this hike is very wet but the further you climb it clears up but it’s still wet and soppy. 
8,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Great hike still wet and muddy in spots. Still some areas of snow at the last 1/2 mile incredible views. It’s a steady climb in the beginning then once you reach the pines in gets steep. Not many hikers at all a few runners. 
9,2019-05-25,['hiking'],The trail was a lot of fun. Muddy and with running water in places. The last 1/2 mile still has some snow cover.
10,2019-05-20,"['hiking', 'over grown']",It's not super well marked where the trail ends but it was a simple hike to take a group of friends on.
11,2019-04-28,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Several awesome views of the SLC valley and Emigration canyon. Snow at about 7000ft, or the last .5 mile. Micro spikes not required but recommended."
12,2019-04-07,['hiking'],Snowcone slush snow. Muddy in places and water is flowing down the trail. Beautiful views from the ridge and the the top saddle.
13,2019-03-17,['hiking'],Hard packed snow so no need for snowshoes right now. Great views and not too steep.
14,2018-10-07,['hiking'],"My friends and I hiked this trail. We couldn’t find the mine but we made it to the top. The last part of the trail was very steep and muddy. The trailhead is marked by a sign addressing hunters. It says it’s an archery only area. There were quite a few hunters, which we didn’t like but there’s nothing to do about that. The views on the trail were amazing especially with the fall color change."
15,2018-09-27,['hiking'],"Underrated trail very close to SLC. The views are gorgeous, and in the fall the colors are amazing on the second half of the trail."
16,2018-06-25,[''],Pretty good hike. I tracked it around 2.6 to the top. Trail was overgrown and hard to follow the last .5 mile or so. Good views throughout.
17,2018-04-29,[''],"April 29th. No mud on the trails until you get to the upper portion. It's shaded, so there is some snow, but it's packed to ice mostly with a little mud on the side. There were three stretches of ice and that was it.

I expect any snow or ice on the trail will be gone in a few weeks. It's pretty and green up there. Went to Ruth's diner down the road after the hike. "
18,2018-03-26,['hiking'],The trail was very quiet on my visit 3-25.  Only saw four other folks the whole way.  This first half of the trail was really muddy.  The last stretch to the top of the ridge is a real leg burner.  Still a couple feet of snow on the steep portion made things more diffiult.  I managed to make it without micro spikes without much difficulty.
19,2018-03-10,['hiking'],Really glad I made the extra effort and went to the end.  Snow was pretty deep and would fall through about every 5th step. Last 1/2 mile is steep also.   Views on return actually rival the top in my opinion.
20,2017-11-17,['hiking'],Easy hike to a big Douglas-fir tree. Pretty views of the canyon and down into Salt lake.
21,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"The first 1.5 miles are beautiful as there are mountains in the background (direct sunlight). The trail turns to the forest and the trail was quite overgrown (thankfully I could still tell the route). I'd highly recommend pants so your legs aren't all scratched up. As mentioned below, the last .3 miles are SUPER STEEP! Exhausting going up and a bit scary down (may have been easier to slide down on my butt). As a heads up, I didn't locate a great place to stop and take in the view (i.e. no rock or true clearing) so I turned around after a minute or so. Overall, great workout and beautiful scenery."
22,2017-06-26,['hiking'],A little over 5 m. Go early or late as the first 1.5 - ish is exposed. Nice short steep incline last 1/4 m. Great views.
23,2017-06-14,['hiking'],Gorgeous wildflowers on the trail this time of year
