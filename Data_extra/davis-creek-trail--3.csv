Way too steep and slippery. Don’t know what ropes other people are talking about. I almost slipped to my death at the first waterfall. "
1,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"When you hike this trail you want to hike the main trail #18.9 up to the fork at #18.8 and then go up 18.5 to ""Hell Hole"".  The East route #18.7 near the creek is dangerous.  See attached map or go to farmingtontrails.org and scroll down to the bottom of the page for maps."
2,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'blowdown', 'over grown', 'scramble', 'washed out']","There's quite a few places where you can slip and fall to your death. I wouldn't call this hike moderate at all. The trail was never in good condition on the steep drop offs (thus the ropes), now the soil is even more lose after the winter we had."
3,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'blowdown', 'over grown', 'scramble', 'washed out']","It’s a difficult climb up the right side of the loop. It takes you through overgrown scrub oak and wild grasses. It’s a perfect rattlesnake and tick home. We encountered both.  When you make the turn at the top of the loop, it descends very steeply though soft dirt on ledges and cliffs. In a few places you could see where others had lost footing and slid down the trail causing the steep trail to be crumbly dirt with no options for good foot placement. The waterfalls are obscured by the canyon as you look down from above. This trail isn’t safe. 

If you want to see the falls, take the first left after the bench and see them from the rivers edge. Then turn around. That would be a short, safe hike. "
4,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'blowdown', 'over grown', 'washed out']","The loop of this trail was awful. You miss the two waterfalls at the end, its hard to follow because there’s so little traffic, and the loose dirt and incline make it hard to keep your footing. Part of the trail disintegrated under my foot and I fell down the mountainside, barely stopping before ending up in the ravine (I would have given this a poor rating even if I hadn’t fallen). The views were nothing you can’t see elsewhere along the east bench. If you’re looking for solitude, rattle snakes and a challenge maybe this is for you. Just be safe. "

7,2019-06-19,['hiking'],"We only went to the first waterfall and would love to go another time without kids (10, 8, 4, 2-in a backpack) and see all 5 waterfalls. It was steep for my four year old, but doable. Great information on the Farmington City trails website for this hike. "
8,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Pay attention the trail is a little further passed Davis Creek. There is a trail next to the creek which is deceiving. Watch for the signs on the eastside of the road. Took the family. Doable for the youngest who is 4 and loved it. Made it to the split and spent time in the water above the first waterfall. Water is cold and refreshing (used a filter). 
9,2019-05-31,['hiking'],"Decent uphill climb, but the constant steep slanted slope is not much fun to traverse. Awkward on the ankles. For the first half of the hike I could hear highway noise and see the salt lake from the side of the mountain, which is the kind of thing I'm usually hiking to get away from. I made it to hellhole camp then turned around because a thunderstorm was right around the corner, and going at a strenuous pace, the hike took about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Completed on the 31st of May, 2019."
10,2019-05-27,[''],"nice hike
"
11,2019-05-15,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'washed out']",went almost all the way to hell hole 2-3weeks ago. somewhat short. tough hike per the usual. waterfalls are amazing right now with runoff. trail was about as good as it ever is lol. bring water or a filter. also when I went to hell hole last year it was nice. wild raspberries were growing above the campsite. 
12,2019-01-28,[''],"It’s a fun trail to do in good weather. Steep, but the waterfalls are gorgeous."
13,2019-01-15,['hiking'],"One of my personal favorites, it's a quick, but steep and tiring hike to Pretty Valley and the frozen cascades are gorgeous. We climbed to the top of the big rocks and looked over the valley. Beautiful stuff. Until then the trail is well packed. We tried continuing past the massive rocks but the deep snow and time shortage prevented us from continuing. Wish we could have continued though!"
14,2018-12-29,['hiking'],The left (North) loop was too snowy to hike safely even with chains so we choose the right (South) loop. Then when we came down we choose to explore Pretty Valley. The snow got thigh deep at the upper end of the trail.
15,2018-08-27,[''],Waterfalls are low right now. Either I’m getting old or I forgot how difficult this hike is. Nonetheless it is a good hike and great workout. I would skip the “pretty valley” portion if we were to do it again. It’s not that pretty.
16,2018-07-23,[''],"Ok, so maybe if you only go to the first waterfall it is moderate. We hit that and decided to continue on. We read the sign going along the creek and said no way, went towards pretty valley but didn't read the reviews before going so wasn't sure it made it to waterfall and turned around about 1/4 mile after the big rock. we took the trail to hell hole from there. After several steep sections made it to another waterfall a bit past the campsite.  Perhaps on a heavier water year it would have been worth it. On the way back we figured let's see what the other trail is like. It cant be that bad going down. Several super steep sections some with ropes not all. Motto of the story, stop at the first waterfall or prepare for a hard hike."
17,2018-05-30,['hiking'],Great hike. Worth it but certainly for those who feel comfortable on the edge. There are a few parts where you’re on a very thin trail over a cliff.
18,2018-04-06,['hiking'],"I agree with all the reviews that have said this hike should not be rated moderate. It’s deceiving because 85% of the hike is great. It’s just the areas where I felt like I would fall off the cliff as I was hanging onto the rope and sliding on my butt that make it so this hike should be rated as HARD. It’s a beautiful hike and my husband loved it, but I was so grateful to be done with it when we got to the bottom."
19,2017-10-18,['hiking'],"This trail is definitely not a Moderate Difficulty! The majority of the trail if pretty steep, and reversely steep on the way back down. I would definitely rate this as Hard or Strenuous. That being said, the directions took me right to the trail head, there's a parking lot just NW of he trail head to park at. Luckily I had my map downloaded, because there were a few spots with forks. The first fork will give you the option to go to a small waterfall and over a bridge and then goes straight up. The other way will continue you on to Davis Creek Trail. This trail goes up the front of the mountain, across the top, down the back and then around to he front and down. Pretty steep the whole time, especially with the leaves on the ground! The colors were beautiful and the waterfall on the back side of the mountain was absolutely beautiful! I would do this again, just frustrated that it was so ill-labeled difficulty wise."
20,2017-10-17,[''],"OK, I, personally, would not rate any trail as “moderate”, if ropes are strung at several places as a aid to negotiating it. Neither would I give a “moderate” rating to a trail which has many narrow, slanted, slippery sections with precipitous drop offs to the canyon floor below, and the only stop if you slide off is the distant bottom. There are several crisscrossing trails, not all of them as treacherous as the Davis Creek trail that runs right next to the canyon. It’s a moderate but easy ascent to the split where you can go left and parallel the canyon (challenging) or go right and take the Pretty Valley loop (I’d call it friendly... kid and dog doable) which leads to and traverses a mountain meadow. The Pretty Valley trail lives up to it’s name, especially now, in the Fall, with leaves turning color. There’s a great camping spot along the way if you’re backpacking. Ultimately the Pretty Valley route will get you, fairly painlessly, to the top waterfall, which is amazing. I got to the top waterfall this route, then chose to descend via the Davis Creek trail which hugs the side of the canyon and eventually comes to a nexus with a bridge that allows for crossing over the creek to the Triumph Trail on the other side. The Davis Creek trail parallel to the canyon is wonderful for its views, but, again, not without some steep, difficult, and scary passages. I wouldn’t take my kids or dogs this way. Nor myself again! The Pretty Valley route, though, gets a big thumbs up."
21,2017-10-12,[''],"The trail is, for the most part, steep. I was glad I had my poles. I started up trail and missed the turn when trail turned South just past bench. There was another trail cut up the side of the stream so I followed it to the bridge. From there I wasn’t sure if I should cross bridge or cut up on the right trail. I chose right-which was wrong. Extremely steep and about 3/4 of the way up, I decided to live to see another day I should go back down. Then I tried crossing the bridge which turned out to be equally treacherous.  After taking in the amazing waterfall view, I slid back down to bridge on my butt just to be safe and backtracked to the original trail and took the turn that I missed initially. Heading South on correct trail, the view was spectacular, and while it was still steep in places, it was completely doable. Either way, a pretty trail and a good workout."
22,2017-10-07,[''],"Whoa, whoa, whoa... Hold up! This trail is rated moderate, and Holbrook Canyon trail is hard? Who does these ratings?! "
23,2017-09-06,['hiking'],"Lots of waterfalls to see and routes to choose. I would rate this as difficult, not moderate. Attempting to follow the Davis County official trailmap stays much closer to the creek and eventually becomes bushwacking."
24,2017-09-05,[''],Took our kids on this one - not kid friendly for us. Pretty narrow in sections and quite steep.
25,2017-08-16,[''],"Easy hike, however I made the mistake on going on one of our 100+ degree days. There were plenty of places to cool off. I did not attempt the rope to the waterfall, however my husband and dog made it fine."
26,2017-08-13,['hiking'],Good easy hike.  Kid friendly my 5 and 8 year old made it okay.
27,2017-07-29,['hiking'],"Very Steep trail. Nice views of Davis County. Decent waterfall at the end. Narrow trail with heavy brush, maybe wear pants or tall socks. Saw one Rattlesnake."
28,2017-07-25,[''],it was fun. steep and it felt pretty quick.
29,2017-07-22,['hiking'],"This trail is quite pretty. I just wasn't really impressed with the trail though. If I did it again, I wouldn't do the loop. I would just stay on the creek side of the trail. My four year old kept asking to not do this one again and to go back to the elephant rock trail. I guess I spoiled her with that hike. Lol!"
30,2017-07-09,['hiking'],"I would say this hike is on the harder side of moderate, its very steep all the way up and there are a few sketchy areas to get to the waterfall. It was beautiful and peaceful!"
31,2017-06-29,['hiking'],"When you approach the trail you will see a bunch of ""no trespassing"" signs.  If you keep going you will find the parking lot up ahead.  I believe the no trespassing signs are for private property on the sides.  This area was not busy at all which is refreshing; however, the trail was very steep!  I need to come back earlier or on a cooler day with expectations of a short, steep hike. Maybe my rating will get updated."
32,2017-06-26,['hiking'],Pretty short hike to the waterfall but overall a pretty good hike.
33,2017-06-18,['backpacking'],Awesome hike just the right level for moderate hikers looking to train for the next level
34,2017-06-10,[''],We went on the wrong trail and went on Triumph trail and it was extremely steep! Eventually we met up with Hellhole which was a nice trail. Not near as steep. The waterfalls are very pretty.
35,2017-06-05,[''],"Steep and slippery with loam and loose gravel, but absolutely gorgeous. I recommend seeing both the lower and upper falls!"
36,2017-06-02,['hiking'],"Steep climb, but so worth it. Overgrown in places, but well marked. Perfect on a summer morning, shaded the whole way."
37,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike!  Steep, but worth it! Definitely get your cardio in.  3 waterfalls and amazing views. My favorite in Davis County  so far."
38,2017-05-30,[''],"Pretty difficult hike, in part because we got off the correct path a few times.  It's easy to get on the wrong trail. Its certainly beautiful and now that I know where I'm supposed to go I would do this again, just be careful to use this app to make sure you're on the path, otherwise it gets very difficult and very steep."
39,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"pretty hard hike,  steep elevation change. if we do it again, well take the left trial along the creek and make it an in and out"
40,2017-05-28,['hiking'],Really beautiful hike. It is pretty steep - I would rank this as a double blue square (in ski terms).0
41,2017-05-28,[''],"We took Helhole up to the upper falls and made a loop by taking Pretty Valley on the way down. We stopped at the lower falls on the way down. This is a fairly steep hike so I'd advise caution before trying the whole loop with young children. That being said, I saw some young kiddos trucking along g like champs. Experience and fitness level apparently count. This hike is a treat to the eyes with beautiful views and fun water payoffs. Enjoy!"
42,2017-05-23,[''],"We took our family on this trail, uphill very doable with kids, we made it to the water fall and the Indian bath tubs."
43,2017-05-20,['hiking'],"I went by myself and felt totally safe! 
The most beautiful trail is also the most steep and most dangerous....but the trail I took led right alongside the biggest of the waterfalls. Absolutely beautiful hike. The way down was tough because it was a steep decline, but otherwise not too terrible! 
That being said, I really wouldn't recommend taking dogs or children on a this trail. These are small paths that have some spots that could be impossible for a child or dog to climb even though in most of those spots, there are ropes to help you up."
44,2017-04-06,['hiking'],"Took hell hole trail to the waterfall and then looped around to the pretty valley trail on the way back. It was straight up the whole way to the waterfall and was pretty tough. It's easy to end up in the wrong direction on the way back, so pay attention to signs and open up the map if you need to. The map saved us a couple times from heading off the trail."
45,2017-03-18,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. It was a little steep, but I'm also out of shape so...the waterfall was beautiful and so peaceful. Highly recommend."
46,2017-03-18,['hiking'],It was a great trail fairly difficult but over all it was really great the Indian bathtubs are pretty cool and the waterfall up top it definitely worth the hike. Make sure to wear good shoes and bring a couple of water bottles or a camelback. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a short hike that is still technical and has great scenery. Must say the the bottom is quite boring but once you get into the pines it is absolutely gorgeous. Hope this will help you want to hike this have fun out there:)
47,2017-02-14,['hiking'],Well marked trails. Great hike.
48,2016-09-23,['hiking'],Was a decent hike. Great if you are looking for a short hike with maximum impact. A friend and I hiked up with our kiddos strapped on. Was a little disappointed by the waterfall section because you end up above the falls. We attempted the Hell Hole cut off but bagged it partway because it was too steep and challenging with four kids in tow. We were very glad we saved the bath tubs for last. The ropes and chains are helpful and the view was gorgeous. Resting there is a little tough with young kids because there really isn't any good seating so you have to be super aware of their movements. Regardless of the challenges we really enjoyed this hike.
49,2016-09-15,[''],Lovely trail. Best part was the baths!
50,2016-09-07,['hiking'],"It is steep, so come prepared. Always take a hiking stick. The ropes and chains were very helpful to get to the Indian Bathtubs. There are several trails to explore. The must see is the bathtubs. Save it for your reward at the end. The pretty valley trail takes you to a nice lookout over the valley. I started up Hell's hole, but didn't finish. The guide says it's a short hike, but if you explore all the trails, it'd add up. The trails were well marked. I'd go again in the spring when it's green.

(We just did this hike again today, October 29, and the chains at the Indian bathtubs are gone! They made it possible to see all three tubs. I was disappointed. )"
51,2016-08-22,[''],"Not for dogs! Very steep trail, wasn't expecting it. And the ropes were helpful but the ground is dry and hard with no flat spots so it was hard to keep your footing. The waterfall was pretty, but I don't think I would hike this trail again. Rough on the knees coming down."
52,2016-08-11,['hiking'],"This trail was badly marked and it was easy to lose track. It is a steep and dangerous trail, not kid friendly! I had my knees giving out on the way down. Go to the Indian bathtub and turn around! There is nothing else worth seeing after that! Never again will I hike this trail."
53,2016-07-22,[''],"Great little hike!  There is some shade along the way;  also, there are a few different opportunities to get close to the waterfalls.  Even now, the water is still flowing well.  Beautiful views of the valley and the great salt lake!"
54,2016-07-04,['hiking'],This is a nice short hike with a beautiful view of the waterfalls
55,2016-07-04,[''],Hiked it July 4th and it was great.
56,2016-06-29,['hiking'],"A great hike to start off the day. it is a little steep and slippery in places, but not to bad. Plan extra time to explore the Indian bathing pool, the waterfall, and maybe hike a little further up."
57,2016-06-28,['hiking'],"Steep but short. I did this hike with my 6 and 8 year old daughters. Good hike but the trail is VERY dry and dusty so there was a lot of slip and sliding. My poor 6 year old went from feet to butt 5 times on the way back down! Also, it would have been awesome if the trail had a more natural stopping place where you could sit and enjoy the view for a few minutes. Still a beautiful hike though!"
58,2016-06-27,['hiking'],"I hiked this trail with my (almost) four year old; the incline wasn't unbearable for her, but we did have to break often. The falls were absolutely gorgeous and a wonderful treat after enduring the heat. While I would not suggest it for someone with multiple small children, crossing with the ropes and chains was easy for just the two of us. Definitely a fun and scenic little day hike!"
59,2016-06-25,['hiking'],"Very cool hike, our kids loved the ropes and chains that help you get to the Indian bathtubs. It's a pretty steady incline on the way up and the trail is quite dusty and eroded so wear good shoes or plan to slip. After the bridge above the Indian bathtubs falls the trail kind of dies out. You can turn it into a loop and hike down the triumph trail but you have to go up a pretty steep portion after the bridge so if you have kids that might not be great. There are signs for another waterfall past the foot bridge but the trial isn't cleared out all the way up to it so if you want to fight through some trees you can get to t otherwise turn around. Fun to just go up to the Indian bathtubs though and enjoy the very cool water."
60,2016-06-12,[''],LOVED IT! The initial hike is short and steep but once you get to the bridge you can do a little free climbing that isn't too bad. The views are spectacular and the waterfall is gorgeous
61,2016-06-10,[''],"Beautiful hike but not good if you have small children. Steep and slick. I think 5 year olds could do okay with help, but any younger need to be carried, which is difficult in the steep areas."
62,2016-06-08,['hiking'],It was definitely a work out! Real short. There's a few branches that keep going on the trail. Pretty sketchy though. Take a partner!
63,2016-05-24,[''],Nice. If you go up the north side it's easy to get off the trail as it isn't as pronounced.
64,2016-05-15,[''],"I dont think is a moderate hike but I really loved it,  beautiful view !!"
65,2016-04-30,[''],It starts off uphill for a good distance and then breaks off into a few different trails. Easy hike with almost immediate scenic views.
66,2016-04-24,['hiking'],"Loved this trail primarily because it's not super ""touristy"" hiked waterfall canyon two weeks ago and there were soooo many people. This trail we saw maybe 6-8 people in total. Loved how ""untouched"" it was for the most part, the obstacles and how close to home it was. Wasn't able to make to hells hole the first trip because of a mountain lion but will be heading back up tomorrow to finish :)"
67,2016-04-11,[''],"Pretty steep from the beginning, a good hike to begin spring with."
68,2015-11-16,['hiking'],"Well signposted. Appreciated the ropes in 2 places and the chain by the Indian bathtubs. Did not go on to Hell's Hole for time's sake, but look forward to doing this."
69,2015-11-10,['hiking'],"This trail is beautiful, there are some amazing waterfalls along the trail and pretty gurgling stream below the trail"
70,2015-10-31,['hiking'],"I hiked the loop up to hell hole and down through the pretty valley campground.
This hike is really steep, especially at the beginning. It is a really pretty area once you get to the loop. On the hell hole side of the loop there's a side trail to prayer rock, which is a great view of the valley, especially at sunset."
71,2015-06-16,['hiking'],"What an enjoyable trail this is.  There are suppose to be 4 Falls along this trail and we set out to find them all.  As you trail along you will find nice side trails leading down to the creek.  Those will be the ones you want to take get a closer look at the Falls.  There is a nice viewing area with a bench for the first.  Along the way you will find a couple different splits to Happy Valley and another toward the top that cuts off to Bountiful Peak.  At Hell Hole you can take a nice break before you head out for the last couple of Falls  the climb from there increases quite a bit.  This trail is good all the way to the 3rd Fall it is the 4th one that is a little harder to find.  It took a couple of try's to find the correct path to it, but it was worth the effort.  It look like they are cutting the trail in a little better when we went.  By the end of our day we had a round trip of 4.2 miles and 1700ft in elevation gain, but that was with a few side trails.  Great Hike."
72,2015-04-22,[''],"I accidentally took the trail to the left of the creek, which sent me up a pretty difficult trail, eventually ending in a rock outcrop that gave me a bird's eye view of the falls. Amazing view, if you're not afraid of heights. The trail is definitely not for kids, unless they have mad hiking skills. Despite the difficulty level, I'm definitely heading up again soon!"
73,2015-02-05,[''],Fun place to do some bouldering and the Indian Bath Tub is pretty cool when it is frozen.
74,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"This is a fun and challenging hike for families. Make sure you take lots of water. There are some steep slopes and difficult terrain especially around the waterfalls and Indian tubs (Not recommended for small children). Also, areas of the hike are shaded with awesome views of the valley."
75,2014-07-27,[''],"Great hike!!! The waterfalls are beautiful. We tried to find the trail to skyline, but lost the trail. The trail is marked well for quite some time. As you get further on the trail, it becomes difficult to follow. Will definitely hike this one again!"
76,2014-05-26,['hiking'],"Great hike with moderate difficulty.  Hiking down to and up from the waterfall is a bit treacherous- during the spring the water moves fast and the rocks are slick, so take care when crossing.  During the summer when its warm (and the water is still cold), there is a nice little pool at the base of part of the waterfall to soak in, with a nice chain bolted to the rocks to make it easier to gain access to.  Be for warned that there tends to be inconsiderate jerkoffs that hunt or shoot up past Pretty Valley (even though Im sure its illegal in that area).  Pretty Valley has a nice leveled and shaded area to camp with a fire ring that seems to get frequent usage during the weekend.  It is a pretty valley, so be sure to keep it that way and pack out what you packed in.."
77,2014-03-31,['hiking'],
78,2014-03-04,['hiking'],"Fantastic hike for all levels of activity. The wonderful thing about this hike is that no matter how long you have to hike, you'll see something amazing. It's quite steep at first, but 15-20 minutes up the trail you can take a brief departure from the main trail and check out the Indian Pools and waterfall. If you're into a longer hike, keep going on the path and check out Pretty Valley or Hell Hole. It really is a perfect treasure for anyone in the Davis County Area."
79,2013-08-09,['hiking'],"A great hike. Not very long but, it is very steep (30 to 45 degrees) for the first mile. Prayer Rock is a beautiful view. If you go in the summer as we did (mid 90 degree range), bring head covering and lots of water as you will spend a good portion of the trail in the sunlight."
80,2013-07-09,['hiking'],"Not sure why this review is called DAVIS CREEK, in Farmington, yet every one is saying it's the OGDEN 27th street hike??   I absolutely, LOVE the davis creek trail. I started hiking it about 5 years ago, and it's been a hidden paradise every time.  I've hiked it probably, 18 times, and only on 1 hike, did I ever see another person.  The beginning of the hike will completely intimidate you.  It starts off really steep and you feel like it's not worth it.  Keep going. :)  Once you get to the Y in the road, go left... you'll soon be in the creepiest field of trees and tall grass every.  As you walk up it, the silence will over take you and you'll feel like, you're being watched.  It never fails.  I always bring my dog.  Once you pass through the field, there is one more giant steep climb... at the top of that, the scenery starts to change, until it REALLY changes, and you come up to 2 pine trees on both sides of the trail. I call this, the gateway to Narnia.. once you go through those two pines, the entire hike is different.  The smells of the pines, the cool misty air, from the river below, the high mountain valley right above you.. it's very beautiful.. very peaceful.. worth experiencing.   You'll come to a river crossing the road, great time to water the dog.. I've seen moose prints along this river, and stayed many hours in the evening to try and spot one, but never have.  Past the river is a little campground... this is actually where the loop meets, if you would have taken the Y Right.  (this loop is fun to take back around, so it's a completely different hike on the way back.. plus over by little valley, there are ALWAYS deer) Head up past the camp ground and keep your eye out for the turn off on the left, marked by tags in the trees.. There is a permanent rope attached to a tree here.. you can hear the waterfall really loud.. follow the rope down, and enjoy some time in the little hole where the water fall is...   There are 4 waterfalls in this canyon... the first is the easiest to get to.. it's about 12 minutes up the trail,  and the forest service put in a nice bench so you can sit there and watch it.  It's a lot bigger in the spring time.. but still pretty. Be aware after the first 2 water falls, you cross a big hillside of rocks.. My brother and I saw a 6 foot rattlesnake here a few years ago.  It took about 20 minutes to get around him, he was right on the trail."
81,2013-04-17,['hiking'],"It is steep.  I like it.  I wasn't expecting the bench so soon and I was expecting it above the waterfall, but that's okay.  We decided to head up to Pretty Valley.  The trail was muddy and thus, slippery in most places, so I do not recommend mid-April with a toddler in the carrier.  But then, there was rain or snow 2 days prior.  "
82,2012-10-29,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! A little steep but worth it. Has a ""park"" bench with a great view of the first waterfall. Fall leaves are fantastic. Sunsets are beautiful too. "
83,2012-08-19,['hiking'],A good trail for exercise and great views. Be aware that there are rattlesnakes in this area. I have come into contact with 3 coming up this trail and I've been up here twice. A beautiful hike to watch the sunset over Ogden. I would wear boots and use a walking stick to check for snakes. Keep your children close by.
84,2012-07-23,['hiking'],"A nice, steep, short hike to what is really not a peak at all but a shoulder on a main ridge down from Mt. Ogden.  Makes for good exercise and a pretty view of the valley below.  You can continue on a bit to Malan's basin, and from there up the creek and ravine to the peak of Mt. Ogden."
85,2012-04-05,['hiking'],"Hike in early April so spring is still on the way, ya-hoo.  The trail is very well maintained and easy to find.  This picture posted was from a bench (I don't know who hauled that up there but thank you!!) and it was a great spot to sit and relax overlooking the waterfall.  If you want to keep going, it was a little steep for small families up to the campgrounds with about another 900 feet of vertical.  "
86,2011-09-16,['hiking'],"No matter how fast I go up or down, regardless of conditions - it always takes me three hours round trip - must be a time warp thing. Either way, it's a great workout with the last leg demanding whatever you have left in you; but all worth it when at the peak.
OK to continue on into Malan's Basin, but if you don't know your way down from there, then go back the way you came - that's my advice."

88,2011-07-02,['hiking'],It does not take all day. 3 hours if you’re really fit!
89,2011-06-17,['hiking'],Made it to the peak.  Will be the last time!  :o) Great hike but to much on me.
90,2011-06-17,['hiking'],Took our time on this one.. took a few horus to make it up and back.  work the hike up the hill must see.
91,2011-03-29,['hiking'],Hard hike but loads of fun. Steep but not to long. Its used all year round
