0,2019-07-30,['hiking'],EACH PERSON NEEDS MORE THAN OR AT LEAST 5 BOTTLES OF WATER (not the single use plastic bottles from the store). We didn’t make it to the top but we were 1-1.5 mile away from the top. The path towards the first major peak of the hike wasn’t clear and had to guess our way through the bushes. LOTS OF WATER!.
1,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"A group of 7 WMC hikers summited yesterday shortly before noon. While not a technical hike, it's long, much of the trail is sun exposed, the trail is overgrown with vegetation in many areas and there's both ascending and descending areas both on the way up as well as on the way down. areas of patchy snow but easily avoidable. No spikes or snowshoes necessary. Bring plenty of fluids. I ran out on a cloudy, sometimes drizzly day. Would have been worse had we hiked on a warm, sun exposed day."
2,2019-06-16,['hiking'],"Made it top, still alot of snow last mile, ice axe would have been nice but able to scramble up snow field and glissade down which saved a bit of time...bring gps or phone to keep track of trail as it is easy to lose in sections... especially the fork towards lookout peak-Grandview....never did find it exactly, though it was probably just covered by snow....also be prepared for a bit of leg scratching as the brambles are grown in ..beautiful hike and fairly easy except last half mile scramble to top...it's just the distance that will get to you!

4,2018-10-19,['hiking'],It’s a long one but the views are phenomenal. Lots of wildlife too. Part trail and part road so it’s mostly easy to follow. There are some fairly intense climbs but they’re short. There is no water along the way so bring all you need.
5,2018-08-21,[''],Great trail. Mostly ridge line so all in all an easy hike.
6,2018-06-28,[''],There is copious signage at the trail head and around the parking lot that dogs are NOT allowed on this trail. Be advised before you drive up. The scenery is beautiful from the pass. We did not hike due to the NO DOGS ALLOWED posted.

8,2017-08-16,['hiking'],"This is a really fantastic long hike, but I could only make it to the base of the final peak (s). The trail completely peters out in a mess of brambles and burrs. Actually for quite a ways up to this point the trail is almost completely grown over in places. This trail will make you feel raped by nature. I did a full tick check after I got home. I will gladly go back and help clear it, I feel robbed of my final destination and view. Does anyone know who I can contact- who is responsible for this trail?"
9,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"Made it to hardscrabble/city creek meadows area (6 and some miles in), ran out of time. Lots of snow from swallow rocks on.  Used microspikes and poles, ice axe advisable on steep snowfields.  So stunningly beautiful.  Makes for a long day.  Not a lot of shade at all, will be hot in summer."
10,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"Didn't quite make the the peak. Too much snow in the last few miles without crampons and/or an ice axe. Private property borders this trail to the East for almost the entire length, which is mostly fine anyway because it follows a ridge line that drops off rapidly. Still a really nice hike - please don't bring your dogs though as the western side of the drainage is a protected watershed/"
11,2016-07-10,[''],not used much. good hike.
12,2016-06-30,['hiking'],Hiked this peak from the Farmington Flats side.  Excellent views as you hike along the saddle looking into the Morgan Valley.  Looked to be rarely climbed.  Didn't see another person the entire hike.

Liked seeing the Uinta Mountains, Antelope Island, and Morgan at the same time!"
