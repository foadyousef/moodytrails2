0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],family hike with 17 month old. 
1,2019-08-26,['hiking'],We really enjoyed this hike! It has a decent climb for the first bit but the stream is very nice.
2,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"Took my family on this hike and really enjoyed it. My youngest is 4 and was able to do the hike just fine. Most of the hike is an incline on the way up, so just be prepared for that. The creek is so beautiful and the trail is lovely and shaded. "

5,2019-07-21,['hiking'],fun
6,2019-07-15,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Great for a morning hike!  
7,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Great hike for the kids. My 4 year old did great on it and the trail is nicely shaded. The creek was the highlight. The water is pretty fast right now so keep the little ones close! There was one spot were the trail is starting to erode, making it narrow. Overall, a really fun hike. Will definitely do this one again. "
8,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'rocky']","The trail was well defined. Great hike. There was not too much traffic and we were able to park in the parking lot. Great intervals, though some of it was a little steep. Mostly in the shade so it was very nice and beautiful at the end! "
9,2019-06-17,['hiking'],"I really enjoyed this trail. it wasn't difficult and provided a good ratio of sun to shade. I particularly liked the river portion of the trail, which was covered by very large trees, making it a cool place to take a rest. There is a parking lot at the trail head despite that it looks like there may not be from the roadside. "
10,2019-06-15,['hiking'],"We decided to see how far we could get up the trail toward Francis Peak. We made it across the bridge, across the stream (which is currently very swift) and then to a second crossing that we felt was a little too dangerous for us. A few people had come down the trail who had made the other crossings just fine, though. We hope to come back and try to make it to Francis Peak later in the year."
11,2019-06-13,[''],"beautiful trail, fairly wide most the time not too difficult for the kids. I do wish it was better marked-we contained down the canyon another mile to a beautiful waterfall. this part was rocky and a bit more difficult, but totatly worth it!!"
12,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']",bugs are just starting to come out a bit..fun little hide
13,2019-05-27,['hiking'],"Kids (3,6,8,9,11) all enjoyed the hike"
14,2019-05-23,['hiking'],The creek looks amazing. Nice short hike with some elevation change. 
15,2019-05-17,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Absolutely gorgeous at this time! The creek is not a creek. It’s a river. And during a cooler day with a little rain brings out the colors and the clouds looming over the huge pine trees were breathtaking! A great short hike!
16,2019-05-05,['hiking'],"Nice easy trail with good bird watching. Elevation change is more than what’s said on here but it’s not bad. Not a lot of people, would definitely hike again."
17,2019-04-30,['hiking'],The trail is in good condition and easy to follow. I think the elevation is higher than what is shown on the app.
18,2019-04-15,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite trails in the area.  I have completed it several times and even taken it all the way to Francis Peak.  After the small section shown here it does start to gain in elevation quite rapidly.  Beautiful canyon hike with plenty to see.
19,2018-12-11,['hiking'],"My husband and I completed this hike on December 9 with our neighbor's dog, Scout.  

This hike was a little tricky for us to find... we didn't realize there was a second parking area up a steep driveway.  Once we got on the trail, it was pretty straightforward, although we did have to use navigation once more to find that path.

We loved this hike!  A slight incline most of the way, with some steeper parts.  The snow-covered tree branches were lovely, and as we got farther into the canyon, we loved the view of the snow-tipped evergreens.  We were also able to glimpse some blue sky! So gorgeous! 

This hike doesn't have a definitive end.... it actually keeps going for 5 or ten miles I think. We had to look on the app to see when this officially ""ended,"" and turn around. 

Overall perfect winter hike for us!  Almost gave it five stars because Christian was excited to see the weather radar up on the peak."
20,2018-08-10,[''],Nice easy hike for the whole family.
21,2018-07-26,['hiking'],"Great, quick out and back. Saw a baby rattler near the start and got some good pictures and video."
22,2018-06-22,['hiking'],"This was a great hike, gorgeous at sunset"
23,2018-06-12,[''],"Great hike for my little ones (7, 5, 2) with shade covering most the trail."
24,2018-06-09,[''],beautiful views and amazingly close to civilization without seeming to be.
25,2018-05-10,['hiking'],This is one of the best hikes around.  It’s like a secret gem. Perfect for kids.  My 3 year old loves it and it has a huge pay off! (Playing in the creek)
26,2018-04-27,['hiking'],"Steady climb uphill when you start, but overall pretty easy! I had my 4 and 9 year olds and they loved it! The trail is actually very easy to follow, there are also a bunch of places people have had fires."
27,2018-03-05,['hiking'],Hiked the entire trail. Great views of the valley and Great Salt Lake after you get up out of the canyon
28,2018-01-18,['hiking'],"very ICY midway up, trail where sun can't melt it. shady through slab  of ice."
29,2017-10-20,['hiking'],"Great hike. Even the little ones, 3 and 6, did great! It’s a very beautiful  hike in the fall."
