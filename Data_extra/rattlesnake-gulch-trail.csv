0,2019-09-06,['hiking'],A great after work hike or trail run. Fun to see the wide variety of user ages and types of recreationists. 
1,2019-08-27,['hiking'],"A short but very rewarding trail. Once you pass the incline, there is about a 1 like stretch of flat trail to the lookout, making it a great trail to run!"
2,2019-08-14,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Dog loves it. Easy. Great views. Best at sunset. 
3,2019-08-14,['hiking'],"Great evening trail! It's shaded off and on but if you're going in the middle of a hot day, you might roast a little. The first half or so has a good little steady incline but nothing crazy. The views once it opens up to the valley are awesome! Be careful of rattlesnakes. There were two on the trail where it turns to longer grass."
4,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"Hard but beautiful. This trail is very steep for quite awhile until you make it up then it levels out and is quite pleasant. Lots of shade, until you get far out on the trail, you’ll start to see SLC and walk towards it and you’re basically hiking around the mountain in the sun. Cool thing is there are options to switch to Churchfork, grandeur peak, pipeline, & 1 other trail. So you can choose to stay on a more shaded trail if needed. "
5,2019-08-08,['hiking'],Beautiful view. Get there early and watch the sunset!
6,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"The highlights of this trail were the incredible views throughout the second half. The first half was pretty much all uphill. After it flattens it there’s no shade so bring plenty of water! This is a great hike if you have 1.5 hours to kill and you want some fresh air, a good workout, and beautiful scenery. Would do again!"

8,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']","I had a good time, felt like I could realistically keep going up but stopped because my dog was overheated. I made the mistake of getting up too late in the afternoon and there’s minimal shade & no water access. Would do again in cooler weather"
9,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"Great hike with mix of sun/shade, switchbacks and steep sections. The summit at the end is a spectac view."

11,2019-07-19,['hiking'],seen a rattlesnake.. beautiful

15,2019-07-10,['hiking'],Fun hike! My 4 y/o boy was able to do the hike by himself with no problems. Plenty of shade and places to take a break if you have little kids. Beautiful views of the mountains and valley. 
16,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"I love this hike - done it a few times and it has never been crowded. The views (of the mountains around you during the hike, and then overlooking the valley at the end) are beautiful. "
17,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","The first .75 mi is steep, rocky with mid to high rock/log steps interspersed. This part of the path is shady. My sisters had a hard time going up due to grade - they told me it should have been rated Hard but I didn’t think it was bad. 

At .75 mi you can go further to the Pipeline overlook. It is 1.1 mi of easy walking/hiking half in shade. This area is not really steep but has some rolling hills.

Going down is when I thought the last .75 mi was moderate because of the rocky grade and just having to watch your feet on the grade with the rocks, rocky steps and logs. 

Overall I really like this hike. Be sure to take water if you go on to the overlook because the path gets hot. "
18,2019-06-28,['hiking'],"Pretty easy trail, took us less than an hour and a half to do. A good mix of shade and sun! The view at the top is beautiful, and the views the entire way are pretty amazing as well. A nice quick hike to end the day with! "
19,2019-06-24,"['hiking', 'bugs']",I’ve done this hike twice in the past five days. The view is gorgeous! Highly recommend for a good view of the sunset. Definitely wear bug spray.
20,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
21,2019-06-22,[''],Would have been 5 stars but car was part of a crime scene afterwards and had to uber home. Might want to hike this trail in groups.
22,2019-06-19,['hiking'],so. many. dogs. mine was the only one leashed. i dont know if it was due to the time we went but expect heavy traffic that involves bikers.
23,2019-06-19,"['hiking', 'rocky']",saw a lil rattlesnake a little bit off trail. 
24,2019-06-13,['hiking'],Fun hike! 
25,2019-06-10,"['hiking', 'rocky']",This is a humbling experience if you are a novice hiker or not used to mountain terrain. Pretty scenery but 100% strenuous incline.
26,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","Hiked the trail on a clear day. Moderate traffic today (lots of dogs - odd day). Great views of city at pipeline outlook. Walked the ridge on grandeur peak trail, which had less hikers, more runners and a few mountain bikers. Great trail. "
27,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'rocky']",A beautiful trail with really beautiful views! Not very muddy at all. Bring a jacket on a windy day. :)
28,2019-06-04,[''],"I did this trail with my 8 yr old daughter and our dog. The second half is just straight on the pipeline trail, but it was steep enough that it made my daughter nervous."
29,2019-06-02,[''],"Absolutely stunning views! Olympus is in yo face. Trail was a little muddy, but it is spring. I would say light to moderately trafficked. Good trail run if you’re into that too. "
30,2019-06-01,['muddy'],"fun little hike with some great scenic views of Millcreek canyon and the city.  a little muddy toward the bottom section, but not too sloppy.  recommended if time doesn't allow for a longer hike.  "
31,2019-05-28,['hiking'],The lookout has a nice view of the valley
32,2019-05-25,['hiking'],A few muddy spots near the top but overall really nice.
33,2019-05-20,['hiking'],"great first hike in SLC. From the end, you can see the bowl and the lake in the distance."
34,2019-05-20,['hiking'],On 5/20/2019 we hiked up Rattlesnake gulch around to the pipeline overlook. Instead of coming back down the same path we went up and over the ridge line (On Gaia its is part of the Crestwood Trail) Once you get to the top you can either take a Left where it goes down Crestwood Gulch trail or you can take a right and go down a pretty steep trail that meets back up with the Pipeline/ Rattlesnake Junction. Not an easy trek but very nice. Next time we will go up that way
35,2019-05-18,[''],"It's a good trail to start summer hiking off on. It starts off intense enough for you to check your heart rate and a dog's condition for more intense hikes. Once you get high enough, the trail evens out and is easy. Was simple, and enjoyable, but nothing too incredibly breathtaking. "
36,2019-05-16,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
37,2019-05-13,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","This is a good trail if you are looking to get your heart rate up just a bit on the ascent and then enjoy a nice easy stroll with good views of the valley. Took my dog and my 64 year old dad today. His first hike of the season so the beginning was tough on him, once we got to the fork and went left towards the Pipeline Lookout it was super easy. Lots of sun and no water nearby so make sure you’ve got plenty for your pup. Mine got pretty warm and she’s used to going on trails regularly. Also I did see a large snake right on the trail about 3/4 of the way up. Not sure what kind, it was large enough that I didn’t want to stick around and find out. He was in no hurry to hide from us. Luckily neither my dad nor dog noticed but this is the second snake I’ve seen on a trail this season so be advised. "
38,2019-05-12,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",
39,2019-05-11,['hiking'],"Great hike in the Spring—not a lot of shade, but doable in the spring or fall. Great view of the valley"
40,2019-05-10,[''],good for a midweek get one in hike
41,2019-04-26,['hiking'],"Good quick hike, a little crowded for a Friday morning. Clear of snow and dry as of 4/26."
42,2019-04-24,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
43,2019-04-18,['hiking'],"Nice trail, dried out.  Little rocky in places but overall nice, quick trail with nice views!"
44,2019-04-07,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'washed out']",It was definitely a good hike for a person to do their first time in Colorado.
45,2019-03-25,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Very wet and muddy.  Quite flick in some spots.  Still a terrific view from the top.
46,2019-03-21,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","Don’t go the way I went during March, steep lots of snow, and Moose’s. Pretty cool sunset. 2.6miles up to grandeur peak, Then and another 3.2 down to the trailhead on the actual grandeur peak trail."
47,2019-02-02,['hiking'],Nice winter hike. Spikes were a must (Feb 2). Lots of dogs on the trail. Great look out of the valley at the top. My Strava said it was 1.7 miles up and back and it took us about 1.5 hours (but not sure if the whole hike was captured). The first half or so is steepish-and then flattens out at the top.
48,2019-01-30,['hiking'],"Always a good short workout. Definitely bring microspikes. Gets pretty slushy in parts, especially in the afternoons on west facing parts of the trail. Trekking poles for extra stability on the ridge."
49,2018-12-12,[''],"This is a response to Wolfie Perry: there are better spots to access the Pipeline further up the canyon. Rattlesnake is probably the worst place to access it, definitely a steep slog. I made a similar mistake hiking with a three year old on my back."
50,2018-11-20,['trail running'],"A great running spot. Easy access, not too hard, reward with a good view in the end. 

There is some trail erosion. Can be crowded over the weekend."
51,2018-10-25,[''],"Fun trail, dog friendly. Took lots of pictures and it took us about 2 hours."
52,2018-10-21,['hiking'],This is a fee area- costs $3 per vehicle for an okay hike.
53,2018-10-13,[''],"It was an ok trail. 
Not much to see. 
we'll find a better hiking spot next time. 
$3.00 to hike it.
The dogs enjoyed."
54,2018-09-16,['hiking'],"Definitely bring your dog on ODD numbered days so you don’t have to keep them out of the way of mountain bikers. There are a lot of bikers, runners, and hikers on this rail. Definitely recommend going in the morning (ie. avoid the heat and crowd). Per usual, there’s noticeably more cars/bikes/people as it gets towards 9am+. Pay $3 to a person in a booth on the way out (back toward I-215).

There are two parts to this hike. The first 0.7 miles is Rattlesnake Gulch- shaded and uphill. It’s a workout.

Take a left at the sign. The second part is 1.0 mile on Pipeline Trail with a nice view of the canyon and then the city/valley. Path is narrower and more windy (as in blowing air, not as in curvy), shade harder to come by. (You’ll see a Wasatch National Forest sign at about 1.4 miles total. Go another 0.3 to see a big metal tube thing and a place to sit and enjoy the view for a bit.)

Going up took us 45 minutes with short breaks going uphill. Going down took us 35 minutes with a bunch of stops to move aside for bikers."
55,2018-09-02,['trail running'],"Hard start, the first 1/2 mile is where you get the elevation gain.  But was a nice short trail."
56,2018-09-01,[''],It’s a little dry and hot. It had a nice view and nice that’s its dog friendly.
57,2018-08-26,[''],"Great little hike. Pretty steep for the first mile or so, but flat after that. Great after work hike."
58,2018-07-28,[''],good first hike solo
59,2018-07-27,['mountain biking'],"I was planning on mountain biking the Pipeline Trail because I read that it was a good beginner trail and I hadn't been on my bike in a few years.  What the site I read didn't tell me was that I had to ride UP Rattlesnake Gulch to get to Pipeline.  I moved here a few months ago from Houston which is virtually sea level and needless to say, that combined with not having been on my bike for a few years, I was totally UNABLE to ride my bike up Rattlesnake Gulch.  I ended up walking my bike up almost a mile and when I saw a very narrow part of the trail that had a rock wall on one side and steep drop on the other, I decided as accident prone as I sometimes am that it would not be safe for me to walk my bike on that portion of trail, so I turned around and walked my bike almost all the way downhill because of the loose rocks......I rode it down the last hundred or so feet when the trail was more packed dirt.  

As a hike only, it would probably have been okay if I hadn't had to push a bike up it, but as a biker, you definitely need to be in better shape than I am to ride up this trail.  Maybe next year, I'll be better able to conquer this one!

On the plus side, it was partially shaded on the way up but not too many places to stop and rest if needed."
60,2018-07-17,['hiking'],"Perfect morning or evening hike! I would highly recommend avoiding during the heat, as only the first 0.5 Miles are shaded.
Gorgeous views of the salt lake valley and Mount Olympus."
61,2018-07-08,[''],It was a nice shady trail to start out with a great view but overall I was disappointed by the lack of a nice resting place with shade on the final stretch and the fact that they charge $3 to drive up the canyon. I wouldn’t hike it again for those two reasons.
62,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"The first bit of this hike is a bit steep, but it’s well shaded, which makes it a fairly moderate hike. I went left at the fork, and the trail is pretty flat and narrow, so be especially courteous to bikers coming up and down. The views of the Salt Lake valley and the surrounding mountains are absolutely lovely. It was about an hour and a half trip for me, there and back."
63,2018-07-03,[''],Fun “short” hike! We ended up turning left at the fork and taking the Pipeline route. Pretty overlook of the city! Bring sunscreen for the Pipeline portion.
64,2018-06-24,['hiking'],"It's a fairly steep climb to the intersection with the pipeline trail, and then if you head left it's completely flat to the Salt Lake overlook. If you head right, you are walking up into Millcreek Canyon. Good panoramic views of the Salt Lake metropolitan valley, but definitely not a wilderness experience. From the overlook, there is an easy to follow, sometimes steep, trail not shown on the map that heads uphill along a ridge to the east, and you can eventually connect to the Crestwood Gulch Trail at a high point. From there, I'm sure there is some sort of perilous path for people who want to come straight down the hill to hook back up with the Pipeline Trail, but I backtracked. Going up the ridge added about 1.5 miles and 600 ft of elevation."
65,2018-06-13,['hiking'],"Used to trail run this several years ago, but now that I've had kids and my body denies ever being that fit, its perfect for a ""quick"" hike. The first .7 mile is an ideal example of ""moderate"" and is nice and shaded, then the mile to the overlook is one of the easiest trails in the valley. Very flat. Definitely family friendly if your kids have hiked several times before. I carried my freshly 2 year old, but our 3 and 5 year olds could do this with only a little whining. Go as early as possible; the mile of south facing trail is almost completely exposed and gets pretty toasty!
Also, DO keep an eye out for the trail's namesake....we saw one along the way (as well as a harmless gopher snake), though they were just sunning themselves near the trail and slithered away unthreatened."
66,2018-06-07,[''],I loved this trail! It's a nice scenic trail.. there's shade right now & even children can do it..both my 15 & 6 year old were with me and they did great!
67,2018-06-05,['hiking'],Great hike with an amazing view! Definitely recommend it.
68,2018-06-03,['hiking'],Fun hike I really enjoyed it. The beginning is quite steep but once it levels out it’s really nice. Great view and fun spot to have a picnic or meditate lol.
69,2018-05-25,['hiking'],It was really nice! Beginning of the trail was steep but after that it was easy and great view!
70,2018-05-22,['hiking'],"Wow!  What a gorgeous hike!  Yes, the first 0.7 miles are pretty steep, but you’re walking through a gorgeous canopy of trees.  Once it levels out, the views are incredible!  This was our first time hiking in Millcreek Canyon, and it didn’t disappoint!  I can imagine this one being incredible for watching the sunset.  The whole family (kids 15, 12, 10, 8) all loved it, though it was challenging for my middle two with special needs...but in a good way."
71,2018-05-20,['hiking'],Super shaded so you stay cool and beautiful the whole time! Loved it!!!
72,2018-05-19,['hiking'],We started from the Church Fork Trail and finished at the Pipeline Viewpoint. It’s a nice hike that you can add more to as well! I would rate the portion we did as easy rather than moderate as listed in here :)
73,2018-05-18,[''],Loved this hike! Perfect for an after work hike during the week! Perfect hike for those who are intimidated to hike! Would definitely hike this one again!
74,2018-05-14,['hiking'],A little steep with some switchbacks at the beginning then opens up to some lovely views. Rather busy but is too be expected of shorter hikes.
75,2018-05-08,['hiking'],Fairly steep until you get to the pipeline trail then flat and easy along the pipeline to the overlook. Great hike if your looking for something quick with amazing views.
76,2018-05-05,['hiking'],"Pretty busy morning with lots of dogs, but everyone was polite and the dogs were super well behaved. Somewhat steep for the first little half and then flattens out across the ridge to an awesome view. The entire trail was well marked. No snow at all right now - everything is green and beautiful!"
77,2018-04-30,['hiking'],"We went Saturday morning and the trail was not over crowded, but we did see quite a few groups as we made our way back to the lot. The beginning of the trail was a little steep with some loose rocks and gravel, but nicely shaded and not very difficult. Once you got past the first 15 minutes, the trail flattened out a bit and became exposed in the sun. There was a nice breeze that kept us cool and the sun had not gotten too intense yet so it was comfortable, but I can see this being a pretty hot hike in the middle of a warmer day. The views were beautiful with panoramic overlooking Salt Lake as well as some views down down Mill Creek Canyon up top. Overall a very nice short day hike."
78,2018-04-28,['hiking'],"Fairly corpulent, I found this trail to be challenging but encouraging. The start is steep and rocky, but going at a slow steady pace makes it bearable. Stopping a few times to catch your breath makes all the difference. Made it over halfway there when I turned back. Pretty good for the first hike of the season."
79,2018-04-26,[''],"Although I wasn’t aware Millcreek Canyon was  a fee area, new here and it was only $3, it was totally worth it. The views were absolutely amazing. Good trail, not to narrow, a little rocky, but seriously the view!"
80,2018-04-15,[''],Beautiful day! Great moderately paced hike.  Slightly rocky with elevation for a little way at the start. The views all around keep your eyes busy. Family and dog friendly.   :)
81,2018-04-09,['hiking'],"I'm out of shape, but I was able to hike this with only a few short breaks. Keep your eyes and ears active! I'm fairly certain I heard a rattlesnake about one mile in. Also, the trails get muddy after it rains, so wear quality boots. Beautiful views along the entire hike, but especially once you reach the overlook portion. It took me less than one hour to reach the flatter portion of the hike, including breaks."
82,2018-04-04,[''],Not great for biking
83,2018-04-03,['hiking'],"Took my dogs on an “odd numbered day” which is when they’re allowed off leash and everyone we passed was friendly and all the dogs well behaved. And to respond to the guy that commented ab the dog poop bags; yes, dog owners bag the poop and leave it to the side of the trail to pick up on the way back since it’s an in and out trail and there are no trash bins besides at the trailhead. While I typically carry mine in my bag, it’s definitely not fun to smell poop coming from your bag the whole hike. But all the dog owners I saw were friendly and conscientious and all picked up the poop and I saw a few pick up the bags to throw away on their way out. Not a big deal to me as a dog owner as long as the bag is to the side and gets picked up eventually."
84,2018-03-31,['hiking'],"We did this trail on a whim this afternoon.  The weather was beautiful so there was a lot of traffic but it's a great workout with great views of the valley at the end.

Watch out for dog bags people leave on the trail.  I don't get it but there they are."
85,2018-03-30,['hiking'],"great trail with great views. A little muddy from the runoff but nothing we couldn't handle. The last mile is flat and scenic, very worth it. Definitely will hike again"
86,2018-03-07,['hiking'],"Great day for the hike! We wore our crampons, it helped with the switch backs, but once you get past the 1st mile it flattens out and you get to enjoy a nice view all the way to the look."
87,2018-02-14,['hiking'],Beautiful scenery. Steep in the beginning and evens out after the first mile.
88,2018-02-10,[''],"We went on a sunset hike here tonight. The first 50 yards or so was a sheet of ice, and the rest just had some really muddy spots. Views along the ridge line were beautiful."
89,2018-02-06,[''],Almost no ice or snow left right now and it's been perfect weather for hiking 
90,2018-02-01,['hiking'],"Short hike, very steep at first. Great view at the end. I went a couple of weeks ago and it was super muddy from the snow melting."
91,2018-01-28,['hiking'],"Most difficult part was the beginning and then it flattens out as you get to the overlook of the city. Overall, it was a decent hike with some pretty good scenery of the the mountains and city."
92,2018-01-19,[''],Just a little icy the first 100 yards then muddy/dry the rest of the way.
93,2018-01-15,['hiking'],Like it. Wanna try the spring time..
94,2018-01-10,['hiking'],"Went right after a fresh snow and it was incredible. Beautiful views of the city, not too steep. I've been back since it's snowed and there are parts that are EXTREMELY icy. You have to wear crampons or at least hold on to branches for footing to get you up."
95,2017-10-22,['hiking'],"Our first time hiking this trail and we loved it! The views along the trail are almost as good as the view at the  end. We carried our 18-month old in a carrier and it took us a little over 2 hours with a stop to eat something at the top.

Watch out for mountain bikers and runners that quickly approach because the trail gets narrow. Also, I think we heard a rattlesnake, but didn't actually see it. 

We will hike this again soon!"
96,2017-10-18,[''],"My first time, I’m out of shape but eventually made it to the top!"
97,2017-10-14,[''],"went with our two kids and the view was so worth it. Gradually going up Views of the nature is beautiful, literally stopping every 15 min just to take pictures. Breathtaking views of the mountains as well!"
98,2017-10-09,['hiking'],Really steep for the first mile but after it is amazing -- excellent hike to see all the leaves changing. We were up there from 3-5 in the afternoon and it was pretty busy.
99,2017-09-30,[''],"I like this one because you re walking along the mountain, which is rare!"
100,2017-09-30,[''],"Great hike...especially right now with the fall colors. You do gain all 1100 feet in the first mile, but then it is flat flat flat and the view at the end is worth it...especially at sunset!"
101,2017-09-29,['hiking'],"This was a fun fall hike. Really pretty fall colors and great views. if you are out of shape, like me, the first mile is a nightmare. after that it's easy. There are alot of of mine tailing and pretty awesome quartz crystals along the route."
102,2017-09-11,['hiking'],Put in some work at the beginning and then it's smooth sailing and the views are incredible.
103,2017-08-27,['hiking'],Start early so the first uphill mile is in the shade.  Great views!
104,2017-07-29,['hiking'],"It's pretty steep and rocky the first 3/4 of a mile or so and then it flattens out. Very exposed, so go early. Great views!"
105,2017-07-13,['hiking'],"Did this hike earlier in the summer and it was well worth the hike. Steady climb with views overlooking the canyon, then you hit a flat trail that takes you to overlook SLC. Highly recommend!"
106,2017-07-05,['hiking'],The first 0.7 going up is steep and rocky but it's also mostly nice and cool with the shade. It starts to flatten out as you head west and there is less/almost no shade spots. The name is fitting as we encountered two rattlesnakes (we heard and saw them) and a third snake we just saw make its way into the trees. Be sure to also wear bug spray and sunscreen. Great view though.
107,2017-07-04,['hiking'],Very fun but is scary when you see the snakes out there. Great for new hikers!
108,2017-07-04,['hiking'],Easy hike. Not sure why it's rated as moderate. It was a pretty little hike. great views. Would do it again.
109,2017-07-02,[''],"Great sunset hike, first part is the most difficult."
110,2017-06-23,['hiking'],"I do this one a couple of times a year, it's very easy and my dachshund loves it. The overlook is very pretty, the switchbacks are mostly shady. Be on the lookout for bikers on even days when your dog must be leashed."
111,2017-06-16,[''],Can't wait to do it again! Even though I'm not a fan of paying to exit the canyon; cash only!
112,2017-06-07,['hiking'],"Great trail, not very difficult."
113,2017-05-30,['hiking'],"As others have said, the first half is steep and very rocky! It does even out and offer some great views of Salt Lake Valley. 
Young kids can make this hike - you just have to endure complaints for the first half! 

This is the first trail up Mill Creek Canyon and is pretty busy. Dogs are allowed unleashed on odd numbered days but must be leash on even numbered days. (Mountain bikes are even numbered and are not allowed on odd numbered days.) 
There is a dog waste trash can at the beginning and offers poop bags - but no other garbages along the trail. 

Make sure to bring water if you plan on going to the top. Once you get to the 'top' you can continue upwards where it gets a little steep again.

The first hike is covered in shade and trees but once you get past the halfway point you lose shade and will have sun only - wear sunscreen if you plan on staying to enjoy the view."
114,2017-05-29,['hiking'],The only real incline is the first half.  If you can get past that it's easy sailing and a reward of great views the rest of the way.
115,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"The first half of the trail is a definite incline, and quite rocky. I found this incline personally challenging since there was a baby on my back! Once pass the incline it gets fairly easy, and the view is spectacular! Definitely worth it!"
116,2017-05-28,[''],The trail was amazing. We followed it as far as the trail went up the mountain (a little farther than normally trafficked). The beginning and very end were somewhat technical but the trail was pretty moderate. The view was unbeatable. Definitely an amazing sunset hike
117,2017-05-21,[''],Somewhat challenging for the first half but the end result is spectacular.
118,2017-05-16,[''],"Gorgeous views of both the mountains and the valley. The first section of the hike was pretty steep, but flattened out once you start wrapping around the mountain and heading toward the valley. Lovely wildflowers. Lots of hikers and happy dogs make this a pretty safe solo hike. It took me about 2 hours from start to finish."
119,2017-05-14,['hiking'],"A little steep for me because i was a beginner at the time and if was my first hike of the season, but a gorgeous way to spend watching the sun set over the city! The moon was bright on our way down, lighting up the side of the mountain like a storybook. Very cool, a little narrow in some spots around the top."
120,2017-05-10,['hiking'],This hike was beautiful! Wow. Like others said the first half of the trail is a bit more challenging but that section is all shaded. Then the last part flattens out and there are the most amazing views! The whole hike took about an hour and a half maybe 2 hours.
121,2017-05-08,[''],Nice overlook of the Salt Lake valley at the end!
122,2017-05-01,[''],"Nice view of the valley at the end. Steep at first, so you still get some exercise."
123,2017-04-24,['hiking'],I have done this trail four times in the past month and can't get enough! The beginning is a bit of a climb. The trail levels out when it connects to the pipeline trail and is easy from there. The views at the end of the overlook are perfect for catching a sunset over SLC.
124,2017-04-11,['hiking'],Easy after work trail with a great sunset view overlooking the valley
125,2017-04-05,[''],This is a better trail for running. I would only give it a 3 for hiking.
126,2017-04-03,['hiking'],One of my most favorite hikes to do with my dog!
127,2017-04-02,[''],Nice hike. I love that the trail hugs the mountain and the views are great. Took my dog on off leash day and she had a blast. It was early Wednesday and there were a lot of people out with their dogs
128,2017-03-16,['hiking'],Nice to get out with the nice weather.  I look forward to repeating this hike when it's a little greener up there.
129,2017-03-04,['hiking'],Fun trail with awesome views. Really icy right now....excited to go back in the spring without the ice.
130,2017-02-28,[''],"Beautiful trail, especially in winter."
131,2016-12-10,['hiking'],"Went there with our dogs, it was very icy so be careful. Also if you are going with your dogs please clean up after them."
132,2016-12-04,['hiking'],Nice short hike.  Good views of the valley.  Just right for our kids (8&5).
133,2016-11-13,['hiking'],"good trail for dogs, steep to start and flat in the middle"
134,2016-10-10,['hiking'],Great short hike. Short incline and some switchbacks. Lots of great views.
135,2016-09-25,['hiking'],"Went last week.  Nice views, close location, steep at first then goes flat.  Dog friendly.  Nice autumn colors this time of year."
136,2016-09-08,['hiking'],"My dog and I regularly take this trail to Pipeline trail.  It is a beautiful place to overlook the valley.  It is steep at the beginning (first .7 miles or so) but then levels out and is flat all around the Pipeline trail.  This is a great hike for dogs.  We did have to watch out for several mountain bikes but everyone was friendly and shared the trail easily.  One of my favorite places to come for a quick, 2-hour after-work hike with my puppy."
137,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Nice little hike, although there are much prettier hikes in Millcreek..  I recommend turning south onto the Pipeline trail and hiking out to the overlook.  Watch for bikes throughout."
138,2016-08-16,['hiking'],Easy evening hike. Bring bug spray for the mosquitos. They were in full force.
139,2016-07-14,['hiking'],Amazing views! Went on a weekday. Saw a few other people but it wasn't crowded.
140,2016-07-09,[''],First mile was steep but the second mile was a piece of cake! As a beginner hiker I loved it and the view 
141,2016-06-27,[''],"great, next to the dog poo bags along the trail."
142,2016-06-27,[''],A nice short hike that isn't too hard at all. Really pretty and a great view at the end!
143,2016-06-15,['hiking'],"Great work out. Pretty step/uphill for the first .7 miles. Then you can go either left or right depending on your mood. Left gets you to the Pipeline Trail Overlook and is about 1.0 miles to the west. To the east, you can go to Grandeur Peak Trail which was just over 2 miles I believe. We went to the overlook as we did this hike after work. Dogs are allowed on/off leash dependent on if its an odd or even day, but they are always allowed. Park fee is $3 and the parking for Rattlesnake Gulch is where the sign for Pipeline Trailhead is."
144,2016-06-08,['hiking'],"Like others have said the incline for the first 20-30min is a good workout. You'll break a sweat for sure. The incline is shaded which provides a lovely atmosphere. Once you get to the flat area to the overlook, the trees clear and the trail thins. AMAZING views of Millcreek canyon and the north side of Mt. Olympus. We met bikers, runners and super cute dogs on the trail."
145,2016-06-07,[''],The incline was moderate and I definitely broke a sweat. I love how much shade the trail provides and the view of Salt Lake was great! I will be visiting this trail more often in the future.
146,2016-06-01,['walking'],"20 min uphill, 20 min flat to reach top. 180 min round trip. Lots of bugs. $3 fee/car with this trail."
147,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"Awesome, especially at sunset.  Also nice to be with someone fun and adventurous if you get lost in the dark and can't find your way back to your car."
148,2016-05-27,['hiking'],"Kid friendly trail, my 3 year old did it no problem.  You hit the Pipieline trail at the end -- if you go west on Pipeline it leads to some great views of the city.  My only warning, if you bring kids, make sure they know to watch out for bikers!"
149,2016-05-25,['hiking'],"We just moved here from Florida and this was our first hike. It was an excellent beginner trail for us and our dogs. It is a beautiful hike with a great view of the city. My only complaint was that it is moderately trafficked and parts of the trail are slim, so it was a little bit of a challenge to get by other hikers and their dogs. I will probably be taking my family on this trail because it is so great for beginners!"
150,2016-05-03,['hiking'],When I went in early April it was still muddy so that plus the fact that it's very steep made for a long 1.4 miles. Once you get to the pipeline trail it's pretty great.
151,2016-04-18,['walking'],Quick fun trail. Not much work but great if you dont have alot of time.
152,2016-04-12,['hiking'],Lovely hike and fun for the dog to be off leash. Great views of the first mountains in mill creek canyon and Salt Lake City. The only downside is the dog poop left by irresponsible owners.
153,2016-04-09,['hiking'],"I usually stay on the forest side trails, this was a good change. Went in April, as I can imagine this would be terribly hot when it gets warm. Trail is great to walk. Great views."
154,2016-03-29,['hiking'],"It's about a 1 mile hike to a big rock and that's also where the switchbacks start. We took the switchbacks for about 2 miles to a ridge overlooking the city then went back down. We do the 1 mile to the Rock and back with our dog all the time for a quick but fairly steep hike. Dogs allowed off leash on odd days, leashed on even days."
155,2016-03-27,['hiking'],"It was a nice hike. I was confused when I came to the fork in the trail, I thought I just went one way and then back down but I had to chose to go to the peak or the overlook and they were both part of the rattlesnake trail. So we went left to the overlook. Beautiful overlook. The trail itself was ok, but it was super rocky. Also, people didn't take care of their dog's waste, there were baggies all along the trail, the owners could've dropped off the waste in the trash can at the trailhead but they left the bags along the trail. So disappointing. Other than it was a nice hike, I would do it again and explore the peak trail."
156,2016-03-26,[''],"I did this trail with my 7 year old daughter and it was pretty intense. we started out at Millcreek Canyon and climb up. Some parts are very narrow. 
Beautiful hike!"
157,2016-03-02,[''],My puppy's first hike. Good start!
158,2016-01-02,['hiking'],Easy hike up to the what I thought was the junction with the pipeline trail because there was a sign that indicated the trail turned left. I mistakenly thought that this was the junction with the pipeline trail . Snow was hard packed so chains worked well. When I returned home I discovered that I hadn't hiked the entire trail.
159,2015-12-26,[''],"Nice, easy trail with parking at the beginning. Main use for this trail is for parking and to access the Pipeline Trail near its west end."
160,2015-08-29,[''],Easy trail with absolutely beautiful views of SLC at the top. I saw a lot of dogs and trail runners on this hike. Great for all ages.
161,2015-08-18,[''],The beginning of the hike was pretty steep but the views were worth it. Great for a sunset picnic. It was pretty busy though and there were a lot of bikes on the trail.
162,2015-08-14,['hiking'],"This turned out to be more straight up than expected but not horrible.
By the time we reached the top we were surprized that there wasn't a better view.
We tacked on a traverse to see a view of the valley that was parallel to the slope.
This probably tacked another half a mile onto the walk but it was painless.
I highly recommend this for novice hikers.
We will repeat this again and try going a little further."
163,2015-08-06,['hiking'],"This is a great hike for sunset-no snakes. Great valley views and easy to navigate down at dusk. The first part is pretty much uphill but there are some nice areas to stop and catch your breath if you need to. Great trail for kids and those who don't hike much.
Excellent trail for running."
164,2015-07-27,['hiking'],"Good trail for running, and a nice overlook of the valley. Watch out for snakes."
165,2015-05-29,['hiking'],"How to Get There: (The directions, even the driving ones are completely off.) Here is how to get there. 
Take I-215 south until you reach the 3900 South exit. Take a left at the top of the exit ramp and cross over I-215 heading east. At Wasatch Boulevard take a left and head north 1 block to the light at 3800 South. Take a right on 3800 South and head east through residential neighborhoods for approximately a mile before arriving at fee station. The trailhead is .7 miles past the fee station on the north side of the road.

I gave this trail 5 stars because it was absolutely beautiful! There was a good deal of diverse terrain, the first half of the trail is pretty moderately steep, and very rocky. We were wondering if we were on the right trail. Part of the way up there is a large rock and a small ""Trail"" sign pointing to the left. Make sure that you head to the left, and don't skirt around the rock. A little further than that it gets pretty steep until you see a sign at a fork and after this point it levels off and is almost like a walk the rest of the way. Definitely a good workout. 

The view at the top is spectacular!! Worth the effort, so amazing beautiful. We did come across about 6-7 other groups of people and we went on a weekday in the middle of the day. So a very populated trail. 

I was with my 4 and 7 year old and we hike pretty regularly, they did great! My sister's kids who are the same ages, don't hike regularly and had a rough time."
166,2015-05-18,['hiking'],"I did this on a Wednesday with an Outdoor Meetup.com group of about 30.  Trail is busy and active after work.  Not to steep and after about the first mile it levels off nicely.  Many MTB are riding the trail down. So keep an eye out.  An easy trail to navigate, you cant get lost. At the top you get nice views of Salt Lake.  Bring a camera"
167,2015-03-25,['hiking'],"First, parking... Don't park in the student parking, there is a lot near the trail head that is pretty big and you should be able to find a spot. The thing that I liked most about this trail was the amount of different trail heads that sprouted from the main road. Landscape was really beautiful and all trails were well kept and maintained. Trail was really dog friendly and seemed to be a hot destination for dog owners."
168,2014-06-23,['hiking'],"This is my first (or second) trail ever that got me into hiking (Spring 2012).  It's ease and accessibility (I started by walking from my house up Millcreek and eventually to this trail, of course, in small steps) make it a great hike.  The Rattlesnake portion is shaded (not Pipeline), and has a great challenging (for beginners) incline at the top when it connects to Pipeline.  One of my most memorable and favorite experiences on this trail was when I first bought my yacktracks and ran down (not intentionally ran, rather momentum propelled me forward) in the Spring mud.   In short, a great hike that got me to finally enjoy the mountains I've lived near my whole life with a rewarding end of the Salt Lake valley should you go West via Pipeline.  To date, my best time has been 1hr (Rattlesnake to Pipeline Overlook) and probably between 2-3 hours two years ago, bear in mind, I did not exercise WHATSOEVER when first approaching this trail, thus, in my opinion, any one can do it, and if you have to pause every 50 feet, that's okay too :)    

(Time to write a review on Mt. Olympus!)    Happy hiking!"
169,2014-06-22,['hiking'],"The first thing that I'll say is that the map on this site is wrong. Rattlesnake Gulch is located in Millcreek Canyon, not in Red Butte Canyon (unless there are two?). Any how, Rattlesnake Gulch itself is a very fast hike (no more than 30 minutes round trip) but it can easily be extended by hooking up to either the Pipeline trail or the Grandeur Peak Trail. If you take a left at the junction (it's marked) and follow the Pipeline Trail to the Pipeline Overlook, you'll find some of the most gorgeous views I've ever seen. From my car to the overlook and back only took me an hour."
170,2014-04-11,['hiking'],"Good hike,  but it is really hot. There is no shade, so I recommend going in the spring or fall. 3.8 miles round trip, about 2 hours"
171,2014-02-05,['snowshoeing'],My favorite trail. Very easy to get too and spectacular view.
