4,2019-08-04,['hiking'],Beautiful. Humid this time of year but a storm rolled in and cooling things down nicely. The hike is moderate as it’s half uphill and then half down hill but love the loop and the view when you get the the end is amazing. Great hike for those interested in a good hike for half day. Took us less than 3 hours even with stopping at the top for a bit and a slow pace uphill.

Too many dirt bikes, hard to enjoy the trail and get into a good hiking pace when you have to constantly get out of their way. Loud and lots of exhaust also detract from the beauty of the trail. Didn’t do the whole loop because we were over it. "

It was pretty muddy when we went because of the rainstorm yesterday. The mosquitoes seem to be dying down, they weren’t bad. We went at 7 am and the temperature was perfect. Only saw one group of people although there were crowds arriving as we left around 9."

9,2019-07-03,"['hiking', 'bugs']","This is such a fun hike. There are a couple of good, steep sections but it’s fairly tame overall. I’ve done the hike three times in the last week as my workout for the day because I live close to AF canyon. Primrose Overlook is stunning right now. The wild flowers are in full bloom. One of the times I did it recently, I took my seven year old daughter and she handled it really well. So I’d say adventurous kids can do this hike no problem. When you start up the trail to the overlook from the meadow, it’s going to get very steep, very fast. This section is quite short though, and the reward is worth the climb. Bug spray is helpful, there are a lot of mosquitos right now."

I definitely got lost a time or two. That being said, this was easily one of the best hikes I’ve been on and the views at the end are incredible!"

While a moderate hike, the elevation gain will make for a good little workout. Be sure to wear good shoes, as the trail can be slippery coming down. Probably best to hike this when the wildflowers are in full bloom, or in the fall when the leaves have changed."
