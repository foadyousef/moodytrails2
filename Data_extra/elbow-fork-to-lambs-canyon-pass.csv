There isn’t much of a view at the top, and the trail connects to another headed toward Lambs Canyon Road, but it’s well worth the trek."

Finish point doesn’t have much of a view but the return leg is beautiful the whole way (given you’re head down humphing it on the way up!). Runs alongside a stream for much of it, handy for the pup. Decently trafficked by other hikers throughout."
3,2019-08-13,['hiking'],"Great trail! Starts out fairly easy and gets steeper as you go. Beautiful views with the wild flowers, stream, trees and Mountain View’s. As you get to the top, it is very over grown and have to go through some vegetation. Totally worth it!!

5,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"The snow is all gone, getting over grown, but still a fun hike. LOTS of wildflowers. Don’t expect a big view at the top, you’ll have to bushwhack to a nearby peak to get some real views. "
6,2019-06-03,[''],"Nice, steady incline all the way up.  There is still some snow along the trail - maybe a 1/4 mile from the fork to lambs canyon trail / milvue peak.  Should be easy to continue through, but the pup wasn't feeling the snow today so we turned around there."
7,2019-05-27,['hiking'],"1.5 miles to start of hike from first gate (still closed for winter). Great hike! Some snowpack at the ridge line but mostly clear. We only passed 3-4 other hikers once on the trail.
Had fun with our pups and they liked the access to water along the trail."
8,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'snow']","I think during the warmer months, this trail would be wonderful! We didn’t make it all the way to the top due to the very slippery slushy snow. However, it was a nice trail and super gorgeous. "
9,2019-05-11,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Did as part of a Lambs- Elbow one way.  Lots of snow, but this side can at least follow the trail to the summit.  The other side, can lose the trail."
10,2018-10-01,['hiking'],Loved this hike.  We loved the fall colors.
11,2018-09-29,['hiking'],"Steady incline the whole way up the trail, but not bad since it is only 2 miles to the top. Pretty shaded most of the trail. Pretty views all the way to the top."

13,2018-07-13,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, definitely more moderate thanks to the gain in elevation for a short distance, but not grueling. There’s a good mix of the trail that’s both shaded and open. Lots of wildflowers toward the top! The only reason I’m giving it four stars instead of five is because there’s no good place to rest and LOTS of bugs among the wildflowers at the top, so I ended up hiking right back down after I started getting eaten by horse flies. Definitely won't be forgetting my bug spray next time!"
14,2018-05-21,['hiking'],Went on a Sunday evening from 7-8:00ish. The road to the trail was fenced off about 1.5 miles before the start. It is open to cars Jul 1- Nov 1. The trail was very cool and nicely shaded. Very gradual beginning of the trail with some moderately steep points. Lots of great views as you go and lots of sunlight even for so late in the evening. When we went we didn’t see a single other person so we may look to trail run here in the future. A bit muddy but I think it had rained earlier.
15,2018-04-03,['hiking'],"It’s a great hike from both directions.  I enjoy the shade and great foliage in the summer in Lambs Canyon.  In the winter, hike up Millcreek Canyon from the gate and snowshoe Elbow Fork.  Few people do this, watch for moose."
16,2017-10-17,[''],"Did this hike the first week of October.  Very beautiful fall colors. Nice hike, easy for all skill levels. Would repeat."
17,2017-10-14,[''],Two inches of snow on the trail made for slippery footing in the morning and mud in the afternoon.
18,2017-08-19,['hiking'],"Steep all the way up, but shady and beautiful."
19,2016-09-05,['hiking'],Nice enough section of trail.  I'd say there are prettier trails elsewhere in Mill Creek though.  Makes for 1/2 of a nice traverse over the pass and down Lambs Canyon.
20,2016-09-04,[''],"Very nice trail for carrying baby in carrier and having dog off leash.  Water most of the way, good shade, great views of gobblers knob-to-Mt Aire near the top"
21,2016-07-12,['hiking'],"Super Great hike. The six year old did well, the four year old had to be carried.  A pretty steep trail until you get to the ridge where you are in damp vegetation and battling flying bugs.  With all that said, I loved it.  Tremendous views from the top, well worth it."
22,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"Until July 1 you will have to walk up the road a mile or so to Elbow Fork to get on the trail.  Watch out for bikes coming down.   Hiked June 22, 2016 and the wildflowers are great near the pass.  Fairly easy hike although it is uphill all the way up so not much flat walking.  Beautiful forest along the way and nice views of the Salt Lake Valley from near the top of the pass.  Lots of flies out this time of year so bring bug spray.  Great Flowers, not many people and pretty views from the top.   My InReach had us going 6.3 miles from the parking area up to the pass and then back."
23,2014-06-23,['hiking'],Started at Lambs Canyon and hiked from there to Lambs Canyon Pass then down this trail to Elbow Fork Trailhead. There are views of Millcreek Canyon and a great close view of Mount Aire from the trail. The trail is quite good and the wild flowers are beginning to add color to the trail
