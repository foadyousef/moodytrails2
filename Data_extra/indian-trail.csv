0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],This is by far one of my favorite trails.  Definitely “moderate” rated.  Lots of inclines and valley. But so very beautiful and unique.  
1,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'no shade']",
2,2019-08-05,['hiking'],This trail was difficult for me... probably even more so that Malan’s Peak. It was a great challenge and very rewarding to sit on top of a mountain!
3,2019-08-04,['hiking'],I loved this trail!
4,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'rocky']","This trail is amazing. We started at the Cold Water side and left a car 22nd. It was 5.7 miles. It is narrow with steep drop offs at some points, lots of loose rock at parts as well. It’s has a lot of pretty good inclines, but also nice breaks with level or downhill sections. Great workout. Loved it. "
5,2019-08-01,['hiking'],I really loved the hike! Not too difficult and very scenic! 
6,2019-07-31,['hiking'],Great trail. Its a little steep but once you get into the canyon the views are incredible. Pretty much had the whole trail to myself.
7,2019-07-26,['hiking'],Pretty great trail to hike up the hard parts and run down the rest. Did the whole out and back in 2.5 hours. My GPS logged 9.2 miles.
8,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"This is an excellent hike as long as you’re aware of a couple of things. One: don’t miss the sign to turn right (uphill) at around one mile in. It’s on a tree and mostly covered. If you miss it you’ll end up scrambling over rocks on what looks like a trail but it’s not. Turn around if you find yourself in such a position. Two: after the switchbacks when the trail splits and you can go uphill or downhill,  go downhill to continue toward the canyon.

We went from the 22nd street entrance over into the canyon by parking a car at each end so we didn’t need to do the out-and-back. That makes the hike just about 4.5 miles and is definitely the way I’d recommend doing things, especially as the decline into the canyon is much less steep than the 22nd street side. 

Happy hiking!"
9,2019-06-28,['hiking'],great morning home to warm springs and back. 
10,2019-06-22,['hiking'],"I have been trail running for several months now, and this is by far my favorite trail. I try to make it every week at least once a week. It's a steep incline from the 22nd St side, but absolutely worth the pain. Hell of a workout for legs. I love flying on the downhill after losing all faith in my abilities power hiking up the  22nd street side, flying on the downhill is such a sweet treat. Some parts are rocky and gravely, if you aren't watching your step, you could easily roll an ankle. Love love love this trail. It's not crowded at all, even in the morning on gorgeous days. I think the steep incline right up front keeps most from going all the way to the canyon. Do take two vehicles or punch out the 8 miles from 22nd to O Canyon and back!! Takes a little while, but this hike improves my street running endurance. I feel faster, lighter, and more agile. I rock Arcteryx Norvan LD Gortex trail runners and they eat this trail. Do this trail, its gorgeous. One weird thing, Cicadas in the trees are eery as they make clicking noises and sometimes flutter by your head, if you're freaked by big flying bugs, prepare yourself, lol"
11,2019-06-22,['hiking'],"I've hiked this trail numerous times since I was a teenager. If you've never been on it before, be advised it is a very narrow trail. There are many spots where it's a steep dropoff, so watch your footing. Also, when you reach the top where the shack is, I recommend just turning around and going back the way you came in. I've always entered in from the 22nd street parking lot, but you can also begin from the Ogden canyon parking lot where Smokey the Bear is. I've also heard that people will park one car at each lot so they don't have to double back out. If you do double back, it's 8+ miles. Otherwise, it's only 4+. (I tracked 5 total from 22nd St. up to the shack and back) "
12,2019-06-09,['hiking'],"I started the Indian trail on the opposite side this week. It was a little steeper, and although different from the other side, still so beautiful. You get to cross a stream and it is well-shaded. 
Next week I would like to start on the 22nd side and park at the cold water side. By the end of the summer I will hike it out and back."
13,2019-06-05,['hiking'],"Great trail, fairly steep all the way up nice workout. "
14,2019-06-05,['hiking'],"We did only the first 0.7 miles fo this trail. I hike with my 3-year-old and 6-year-old as well as with some friends, so take that into consideration when weighing my review. This hike was not as much in the trees as I anticipated. It did make some of the younger kids nervous as it was steep and narrow and the drop off was pretty steep. However, I wasn't nervous for our safety safe. The view was nice and the kids loved to be able to see a waterfall. I would love to try it again when we can go a little farther."
15,2019-06-03,[''],Great hike that we complete on a yearly basis.  The first leg is steep but the views are rewarding.
16,2019-06-01,['hiking'],Tough trail for running with all of the elevation gain. Enjoyed the downhill going towards Ogden canyon after the cabin. The canyon side is a much better trail. 
17,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"Wonderful hike with pine trees and beautiful views. Long, but plenty of parts of the trail that are flat mixed with elevation changes. "
18,2019-05-28,[''],Not sure how this trail has any less than 5 stars. Started at the 22nd St. Trailhead and made it 2 miles before the trail looked washed away down a steep chute. Had to turn back. Looking forward to completing this trail from the other direction. Gorgeous canyon and alpine views!
19,2019-05-19,['hiking']," Outstanding views at the top of Coldwater Canyon: The trail is very well maintained and very easy to hike, except for a few parts where the trail is narrow. Recommended to all ages.  "
20,2019-05-05,['hiking'],Awesome hike.  feels like the high mtns!!
21,2019-04-29,[''],new to Utah and this was my first trail here me and my kids loved it. 
22,2019-04-25,['hiking'],"We hiked today East-West (Coldwater Canyon-22nd street). We got a little lost near the campsite area at the top of the switchbacks at the beginning of the trail (turn left and go downhill, not right and uphill!) and ended up in a weird scrambly scree section before turning around. It was mostly dry with a few areas of lingering snow in the higher sections. If I were to do it again, I would have appreciated my trekking poles. Outstanding views at the top of Coldwater Canyon."
23,2019-04-19,['hiking'],"Hiked the West end of Indian, trails mostly clear of moisture."
24,2019-04-19,['hiking'],"This is a go to trail for me.  I absolutely love hiking this trail.  I have made the hike from both sides and would have to say the easier route would be starting from the 22nd St, side.  One thing that makes it one of my favorite is my fair skin.  This trail offers the shade my skin needs.  Not mention it is just a beautiful trail.  One thing I have noticed, I happen to encounter more rattlesnakes along this trail than others in the area.  Just keep an eye open.  Usually on the coldwater leg of the trip.  
I had some spare time to today, so I am trying to log all the trails that are either new or neglected in the past."
25,2019-04-18,[''],awesome fun and enjoyable
26,2019-04-04,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Love this trail. Great for dogs and a starting and ending points. Make sure you read the plaque when you are on the 12th Street canyon trailhead that talks about the giant kiln!
27,2019-03-31,"['mountain biking', 'rocky']","Great trail very fast and rockey definitely a harder intermediate trail to ride with some of the rock gardens over all very long,fun, and tenical trail."
28,2019-02-12,"['hiking', 'snow']",
29,2018-10-20,[''],We love this trail. But about three weeks ago my dog got suddenly sick and passed away after hiking in the same spot on this trail two days in a row. I am wondering if anyone else had a similar experience?
30,2018-10-15,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, take your time and really enjoy the views."
31,2018-10-09,[''],one of my favorites especially in the fall. beautiful colors and views. I start at 27th or 22nd.
32,2018-09-27,['hiking'],Starting at the Cold Water Canyon trailhead for this hike there was a large congregation of wasps blocking the trail about 0.75 miles in. They were attracted to the water that flowed over the trail and there wasn't a good way around them. We decided to turn around and hike a different trail in the canyon instead.
33,2018-09-15,['hiking'],Great hike! I would suggest having two vehicles. One at 22nd Street and one at the canyon trailhead.
34,2018-09-12,['hiking'],Love this Hike I like to go up there from 22nd Street and look at the beautiful scenery.
35,2018-09-02,[''],"Love this trail. It is great for a longer hike, with some elevation gain."
36,2018-09-02,[''],Beautiful hike. Good workout with great views.
37,2018-08-07,[''],Great trail for an out and back!
38,2018-07-21,[''],"Loved it.. started from the chimney on 12th St in shade.. so glad last portion to 22nd St where 2nd car was parked was all in sun. Saw all bridges, tee pee, cabin/fort, awesome overlook.. best hike I’ve done all year.. well Adams is still my fav.. and ate some wild raspberries... 3.5 hrs.."
39,2018-06-20,[''],"Started at 22nd st trailhead to the other and back. Should have shuttled but only had one vehicle. Confusing part when past the emergency shelter, remember head left. Took 4 hours round trip."
40,2018-06-16,[''],"Hiked Indian Trail this morning from 22nd Street to the trailhead in Ogden Canyon, then shuttled back to the start. Totally enjoyable, moderately challenging, great scenery. Will do this one again. Only problem was the dog owners who disregard the leash requirements. One of the members of our group had a dog, leashed, which was attacked by an unleashed dog from another group. Simply inexcusable on the part of the dog owner. Hiking time: 2:06:47, distance: 4.52 miles, elevation gain: 1,852 ft."
41,2018-06-14,['hiking'],"I finally completed this entire trail on my second try. Using this app on my cell was extremely helpful as I tend to occasionally find myself on an off-shoot of the trail I'm supposed to be on. This was quite the hike. Medium skill level maybe but I would say it more changes throughout varying skill levels. There is a little cabin (lookout) at about the halfway point. It's worth pushing yourself that far. This was about 1.5 to 2 hours in for me. (3 hours for the whole trail, 22nd Street Trailhead to trailhead in the Ogden Canyon). When you start to head down toward the river, you will find a campground that has a tee-pee type structure built next to the firepit. Very cool. Several more campgrounds, a little man-made waterfall and four bridges later, Eureka...I made it!"
42,2018-05-14,[''],"Beautiful trail, gives variety of path from easy to a bit challenging. Goes along the ridge opening  up new views along the way. Beautiful wild flowers and a view of waterfall from afar. You will encounter view of great salt lake and snowy tips of the summits. 
Would hardly recommend to anyone"
43,2018-05-12,[''],"I hiked this trail with my sister, brother-in-law and daughter. We went a couple of miles, but had to turn back to go to massage appointment. Beautiful views of valley and canyon!"
44,2018-05-05,['hiking'],"Great hiking! Started from 22nd street trail head.   First 2 miles are steep up hill and little hard, but we enjoyed the amazing view and nice breeze coming through the canyon!  We did about 4 miles today, and definitely would like to finish the whole trail next time."
45,2018-04-24,['hiking'],We made it to the overlook point and had lunch. I would suspect this hike is really hot during summer. We went when it was a little windy to keep cool.
46,2018-03-12,[''],"My husband and I did this hike with my little sister on March 4. There was a decent amount of snow, but my little sister made it without spikes or snowshoes. We only went in about 1.5 miles before turning around."
47,2018-02-09,[''],"If you go during winter, wear your Yaktrax. Beautiful hike with great views."
48,2017-11-11,['trail running'],"Beautiful trail!  Definitely a moderate; nothing crazy, just a few steep areas to watch out for.  Went all the way out and back from 22nd street.  Great trail for running."
49,2017-10-18,[''],This tail is so pretty right now with all the fall colors!
50,2017-09-17,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful in Sept. If you start on the 22nd street side be prepared for an incline. It's uphill for about 1.5 miles.
51,2017-09-17,['hiking'],"this was a very nice trail. it was maintained really good and pretty easy to hike, at least to the second bridge. I took my 3 year old and 4 year old and they had a great time. it is really steep for the first half mile but after that was pretty smooth, and by smooth I mean Rocky, sailing."
52,2017-09-14,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. I hiked this part way 3 years ago but my knee started giving me problems so I had to turn around. I wish I could have kept going.
53,2017-08-11,[''],This was epic. I loved it. Some great vistas and making it to the top was really rewarding. Bring a ton of water if it's hot because once you get about 3/4 of the way up it gets steep and hydration is key
54,2017-08-07,[''],Really great view of the city and of Ogden Canyon.
55,2017-07-06,[''],"This has become one of my families favorite hikes.  The section from Ogden Canyon to the Nevada Viewpoint is mostly shady and not too difficult.  There are a few places where the drop offs are very hairy, but the view at the top is beautiful.  We have never run into rattlers ourselves, but several others in passing have seen them and gave warning."
56,2017-07-01,[''],"Started this trail from the 22nd street trailhead. It was pretty steep right from the beginning but eventually leveled off somewhat. There were bees at every turn for the first 3 miles. A lot of the photo ops people are posting aren't until you hit the last mile which just takes you to the road along Ogden Canyon. There was no grand peak or waterfall if you're looking for something spectacular at the end of the hike, I wouldn't recommend this. Just a long 4 mile hike through the rocks and trees and a few steep drop offs so be careful not to slide downhill."
57,2017-07-01,['hiking'],I wasn't that impressed with this hike. Some of the views were pretty but other than that the hike was pretty boring. There are bees everywhere it is kind of a nuisance. There are a couple sketchy parts where if you lose your footing you could fall to your death. You start at 22nd street and end in Ogden canyon or vice versa.
58,2017-06-29,['hiking'],"This is one of my favorite trails. 
once you make it to where the trail follows the stream, it becomes shady and beautiful.

There are places to backpack in and camp, but watch out for glass. there are a lot of broken bottles from drinkers who want to ruin it for the rest of us.
imo, if you're going to drink, use a flask, you don't have to worry about it breaking and your more inclined to pack it out afterwards. and it's lighter than glass usually. That's what I prefer to do anyway."
59,2017-06-29,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful hike.  One of my favorites. Very clean and easy to follow trail.
60,2017-06-24,[''],"We love this trail, it's very shady, beautiful views from the top."
61,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Loved this trail. Beautiful scenery. Saw a rattle snake so careful where you step. The view is amazing and I loved the shade too. I new to hiking. So a note, if the trail v's don't take the one with the tree limb across it. Lol did a lot of rock climbing to get back to the trail."
62,2017-06-14,[''],One of my favorite trails. it's beautiful all year round.
63,2017-06-05,[''],"One of my new favorites, it has some drop off areas and is definitely a moderate. we parked at Smokies sign of 12th Street going into the canyon and walk down to 22nd Street, amazing views"
64,2017-05-30,['hiking'],Awesome place to hike!!!
65,2017-05-28,[''],Great hike!!
66,2017-05-27,[''],This trail was absolutely breath taking! Beautiful wild flowers everywhere and the views are amazing. The trail itself is also a perfect amount of incline...not to hard but not to easy.
67,2017-05-22,[''],"started at 23rd street went to 12th street parking, then back. The way back was a workout, but worth it. Next time we want to start on 12th and see which is harder. Great workout. 3.5 hours."
68,2017-05-08,['hiking'],Fun to do point to point and shuttle between trailheads.
69,2017-05-08,[''],"Great views, great workout!"
70,2017-04-15,[''],superb hike. steep
71,2017-04-09,[''],This is a beautiful trail. I did it in January when there was about 5 foot of fresh powder.
72,2016-12-18,['hiking'],Great trail and amazing scenery. Hard hike if you don't have the proper shoe wear so I recommend you buy some nice boots and bring gloves during the winter!
73,2016-11-07,[''],very sweet walk I like how closed  in it gets . It also offers  some cool history  about when the trail was formed and who lived on the trail in the winter
74,2016-09-22,[''],"Fun, steep, shaded trail."
75,2016-09-06,[''],"Starting at the smoky bear sign in Ogden canyon . There is a small parking area . Trail goes up a few switch backs crossing a couple of bridges   , the trail forks left fork is the trail head to cold water canyon . Continue straight trail curves  right continuing to climb up over a rocky ledge and threw the pine trees across a rock slide and arriving at the emergency shelter on top. 
Turn around and head back or continue to the 22nd street parking lot . 
Trail goes down but then heads straight up for about 1/4 mile trail dose some up and downs until you arrive at a very narrow trail around a large Boulder then down some narrow switchbacks continuing along the mountIn side , rounding the point looking into Ogden canyon , more switchbacks and emerging out looking into Ogden valley .."
76,2016-09-03,[''],This so far is my favorite hiking trail around Ogden . It's a beautiful hike & about 80% of the tail is shaded. There is also free spots up there for overnight tent camping.
77,2016-08-29,[''],its a workout and some nice people you meet there
78,2016-08-08,[''],awesome. very hard. really good workout.  beautiful
79,2016-07-27,['hiking'],the sights were amazing and the trail was a challenge but it was well worth.
80,2016-07-05,['hiking'],"Great trail, we connected by taking Coldwater Creek trail, which is a really good, slight incline!! The trail took us up top to a huge boulder! I was with my 3 and 7 yr old and the trail only got a little difficult for my 3 yr old. Lots of shade until you get closer to the top."
81,2016-06-10,[''],
82,2016-05-29,[''],Challenging and beautiful. Abolutly stunning views of both Ogden and Ogden Canyon. We did the full trail and back which took about 4.5 hours. Totally worth it.
83,2016-03-20,[''],one of my favorite hikes in Weber county.
84,2016-01-27,['hiking'],"I've hiked Indian trail in the summer and fall, this was my first time in the winter. I started from the 22nd trailhead. The mountains and trees look beautiful covered in snow. Some girl commented saying its boring. It's no Lake Blanche, but definitely not boring. There's lots to see-you can get a good look at the canyon below and the mountain peaks on ahead. Lots of evergreen trees so at some points it's like being in a forest."
85,2015-10-17,[''],"Thought it was a fairly average and boring trail. The sites weren't unique or breath taking, not even with the autumn colours. The history behind it is interesting, but again, nothing unique or special about this hike."
86,2015-09-21,['hiking'],"Fun hike, lots of great scenic spots and overhangs. Also like everyone else says watch out for rattlers. With how many spots there are for kids to slip down the slope I wouldn't recommend children under 10 going up the whole way, beginning portion is fine and simple though."
87,2015-06-29,['hiking'],"This is a great trail, one of the best in the area. This trail has great views."
88,2015-06-09,['hiking'],Beautiful!  Watch out for rattlers tho!
89,2015-04-29,['hiking'],"I think this is one of the best trails in all of Ogden.  A moderate trail that will take you across 3 ridges of Ogden Canyon at a nice altitude.  You can experience thick pine forest, rough rocky ridges, and lush groves of aspen.  Awesome trail!"
