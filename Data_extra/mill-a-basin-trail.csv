1,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"Nice views on this busy trail. At aspen tree line begins an abundance of stinging nettles along and off the trail. Great view of BCC from Circle All peak, worth the short detour. "
2,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"Beautiful and peaceful.. one of the few trails less traveled. The trail is really well respected and easy to follow. Wear pants/leggings and you'll be a happy hiker.
It will be magical come mid July with all the wildflowers ready to bloom!
The first section to the fork is a doozie, but probably considered more of a Moderate level if you're used to local hiking.
Experienced younger kids could probably hike just fine (with some complaining), but don't recommend for a fun family hike!"
3,2018-06-24,[''],"this would be a hard running trail just based on the steady 30-45Â° incline to the top, but for walking I might say it is more moderate. Great if you are looking for a lot of vegetation/wildflowers "

My 3 year old hiked up most of this trail on his own, only wanting to be carried when the trail got real steep. I have taken this trail all the way to Dog Lake and then hiked down the other way. It's very rewarding and the views are breathtaking. It's also very secluded, you usually only pass by a few people, if any at all."
5,2016-07-15,['hiking'],"For a hike, it is enjoyable and challenging although I question it being classified as ""hard."" Lots of low vegetation and wild flowers, beautiful smells and camo for animals. I walked up on some deer and a young moose and a note was left that bears had been on the trail the day before. Trail is smooth, good for running. Hikers may want to wear long pants and sleeves due to all the vegetation and swarms of flies. The views are beautiful, didn't see one other hiker on a Friday afternoon... Enjoy!"

7,2013-06-17,['hiking'],"This trail's Overview should be clarified: The ""3-mile Out and back"" is from the Butler Fork trailhead.  About a 1/2 mile up Butler, you stay left to catch Mill A that meets up with the Desolation Trail another mile up.  Since the Mill A Basin trail is really a short section of the Desolation Trail that wraps around the south side Mount Raymond, it can also be accessed from the Mill B North Fork trailhead for a longer route."
