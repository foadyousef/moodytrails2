0,2019-06-23,['hiking'],Beautiful walk around the lake!! Excellent views of the mountains and easy for a toddler to walk on.

I have done this “trail” each year that I have lived in Utah as it is so peaceful, unfortunately, I have not been there since the fires last year tore through this area so it’s possible that some of its beauty is no more."

I personally think Tibble Fork Resevoir is more beautiful, but it’s also windy and sand gets blown everywhere up there. Big East Lake was quiet and not windy. Really loved it, as did my three kids!"

4,2018-08-02,[''],"This was a nice, easy, and beautiful paved trail. It’s less of a hike and more of a leisure walk for the whole family to take in the sights and enjoy. Plenty of benches and picnic tables, so be sure to pack a lunch!"
5,2018-07-06,['walking'],A very well maintained paved walking path around the lake. The best time to be up there is in the fall. The colors are incredible. We were there on a weekday and had the lake to ourselves. The path is pretty much flat and can be done with a stroller or wheelchair.

7,2017-07-28,[''],Easy and stunning.

9,2017-07-03,[''],We really enjoyed the trail around the lake. Very kid friendly.
10,2017-07-03,[''],"Went on a walk around the lake today (Sunday) and it was filled with people hiking, boating, skipping rocks, fishing, and just relaxing. And it was wonderful. The weather was fantastic, it was cloudy and only a little sunny. There was a breeze and it felt great. Highly recommend for leisure activity."
11,2017-07-01,['hiking'],The walk around Big East Lake is gorgeous!  We brought the fishing poles and fished until 10pm when the day-use area closes.  We'll definitely be back.

13,2017-06-07,['hiking'],"Great 'hike' (walk) for kids - nice scenery and paved path you can drive right up to. Grotto Falls is only 5-10 minutes down the road and is similarly simple/beautiful, so they're a good combo in a single day, even with kids!"

It’s a nice easy walk. The fall leaves looked colorful."
