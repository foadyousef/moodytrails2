0,2019-08-24,['hiking'],This is a short but fun and beautiful hike. We only saw two other groups on the way there and then a couple more hiking in as we were coming out.
1,2019-08-21,['hiking'],Great hike to do with your kids
2,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"The trail is open! Thanks to the Spanish Fork Ranger District for restoring this trail. There is definitely some noticeable burn damage from last year's fire, so it isn't nearly as green as I imagine it once was. But the waterfall is stunning! Footing is a bit tricky in some places. This is definitely one of my favorite trails. "
3,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"Trail is open! Thanks to all the hard work done to get it back. Lots of burned areas, but they rebuilt some foot bridges. Waterfall is still beautiful and it’s a quick and easy hike!!"
4,2019-08-09,['hiking'],Nebo loop is closed!
5,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"This trail is now OPEN after having been previously closed due to damages from the 2018 Bald Mountain Fire. I personally verified by driving up the canyon and as of 8/04/2019 several signs posted by the Forest Service in several locations along the Nebo Loop Road have been modified to show the Grotto trail area as OPEN. Still a fun and easy hike, but many burned trees along the mid-to-upper portion of the trail. Not as forested, green, and scenic as it once was along the trail but waterfall at the end remains about the same as always. "
6,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes to take my daughter on - have been going on it together since she was 2 1/2. She’s now 6 and a great little hiker but she still enjoys this short trail because it’s filled with little “adventures”. Log bridges, stepping stones and a waterfall payoff at the end. Definitely recommend for families with young children. "
7,2019-07-13,['hiking'],The signs still say it is closed and beg people to stay out. 
8,2019-05-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'snow', 'washed out']","Road still closed. Path was muddy and bridges are washed out. If you venture on, the waterfall has a lot of water flowing over it right now."
9,2019-02-13,"['closed', 'snow']",road closed due to huge pile of snow on the way there
10,2018-09-17,[''],Loved this trail. Unfortunately it burned in sept of 2018. who knows when someone will go and replace all the wood bridges. Even if they did it will be a very sad sight for a while.
11,2018-09-11,[''],Beautiful hike. Not much water this time of year. Want to do this in the spring.
12,2018-08-21,['hiking'],"Fun little trail with the kids. Loose cows on the trail, so watch for the cow pies. I was surprised at the amount of liter on the trail. Packed out what we could. Beautiful area and easy hike."
13,2018-08-20,[''],Just a quick walk but a beautiful little spot.
14,2018-08-17,[''],It's very easy hike. My two year old loved every minute of it. It's pretty and we loved the water fall.
15,2018-08-09,[''],Short and sweet! There are a lot of bridges to help you along the way and make it easier for your kids.
16,2018-07-27,[''],Great in the fall during the Nebo loop.
17,2018-07-27,[''],"Always a beautiful, short hike along water.  The grotto is easy to access too.  Good for young children"
18,2018-07-26,['hiking'],This was a perfect little hike for my 2 and 4 year olds. I thought it was a little too short for me but was fun to do. Beautiful along the trail. We had the waterfall to ourselves at around 9:30 am but close to 10 it started getting pretty crowded (for a week day too).
19,2018-07-24,['hiking'],Hiked with my 5 year old granddaughter and her mother....we all had a great time .... I received much instruction from my granddaughter. Only two people met on trail.  Hiked at 8:00 in morning back home by ten
20,2018-07-22,[''],"Easy, short, family friendly and fun, but usually extremely busy with lots of people."
21,2018-07-18,[''],"Very pretty, fun little hike it can be crowded though."
22,2018-07-17,['hiking'],This is a super east and fun hike. Would highly recommend!
23,2018-07-15,['hiking'],"The trail on its own is a great introduction for inexperienced hikers. My 5 year old son could accomplish the trail without needing any assistance or requiring a break. It has a few log bridges that cross the waterfall's stream that kids enjoy. The stream's size fluctuates depending on the run-off, but I have never seen it go above ankle deep.

This trail seems to attract a big crowd. plan accordingly around peak times or you maybe disappointed."
24,2018-07-14,['hiking'],The easiest hike I’ve done it is short and so pretty with all the pine trees around. The water fall is small but a really nice place to go . I recommend it to go really early in the morning so you can enjoy the place to yourself.
25,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"Overcrowded and unsafe. 

It was packed with people and little kids. Someone above the grotto dislodged a bolder that came crashing down into the area below. It was a miracle no one was killed or seriously injured. It was a hot day so everyone was in the shade around the edges around the edge of the grotto. If a kid was in the sun or crossing from one side to the other they could have easily been crushed.

My sister in law's ankle was hit by rock fragments. We did some quick first aid, packed up and left. 

There are dozens of other great hikes in Payson Canyon. If you do go to the grotto, I would suggest avoiding crowded Saturdays during peak summer. In any case, keep your kids close and be hyper aware of who and what's above you."
26,2018-07-06,['hiking'],Super easy and lots of fun for kids and our puppy. My 2 1/2 year old did it with no problems. I did have to help him on a few areas but otherwise very family friendly. Bring water shoes to walk in the water at the end.
27,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"We did not see anyone when we went in October. Fun little falls for the girls but nothing to write home about. It also seems very trashy. Soda bottles, cans, bags all over the trail."
28,2018-06-21,[''],"Perfect trail for smaller kids, beautiful waterfall. Plenty of space for kids to play but super crowded. I rated 4 stars for that reason. if it were less crowded it would be 5 no question. The trail is really pretty but short."
29,2018-06-18,['hiking'],"There is no doubt this is a very heavily trafficked trail. The trail is quite leveled out by all the foot traffic as well as some trail sides. Finding loose stones or gravel is almost impossible on most of this trail due to the heavy foot traffic. That being said, there are times this trail is very quiet. When we went in, we saw only one couple at the falls, then exiting we saw a few people entering, which meant we had the whole trail virtually to ourselves for the hour we were here. While the trail is easy, and they have made it easy to get to the falls, there are places there are wooden boards, bridges and logs that go over the stream. Once you get to what seems like the end of the trail, there will be a rock face to your left, a very smooth tree stump ahead of you, and a place to step down into the creek to the right. Go down into the creek and cross through the water or over the log bridge, and around that rock face you will see the falls. You have to go down into the ravine to see the falls or you could see it from above if you climb/scramble up the rock.

Note on the distance: Alltrails mentions .6 miles, the trailhead says .5. I have tallied .9. Actually it would be closer to .8 (.1 from car parking to trailhead)."
30,2018-06-09,[''],We visited in the fall and the colors were gorgeous. The trail and grotto were a little busy since it was a Saturday morning. A fairly easy hike with lots of crisscrossing over the creek.
31,2018-06-06,['hiking'],"Super fun! Very quick, would be great for any age. Bring the baby! Beautiful hike, and the falls make for a satisfying destination. Good one for a hot day, as the trial is mostly shaded and the falls provide a nice cool-off at the end of the trail. Would do again! Great for a last minute outing or before or after work."
32,2018-06-03,[''],Fun for families and short.
33,2018-06-03,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful! Short, easy trail, but busy."
34,2018-06-02,[''],Love this hike! We take our kids and dogs and it is very easy! Our favorite and our “go to hike”.
35,2018-06-01,['hiking'],"Was really easy...even took a stroller, had to lift it a few times, but the trail is super easy and beautiful! Water is super cold, would recommend going on a hot day so you can enjoy the cool off!"
36,2018-05-28,[''],Worth a visit
37,2018-05-26,[''],"Pretty and enjoyable. I definitely do it again, and our two year old managed it quite well. But super crowded. There were so many people in The Grotto that was didn’t spend a lot of time there. So avoid on holidays/weekends!"
38,2018-05-15,['hiking'],Small little hike up to the waterfall. It was a little muddy from the rain but it was great and fun
39,2018-05-06,[''],Gate is open. There's lots of water and around The Grotto it's muddy. No dinosaurs were found!
40,2018-04-09,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Gates are still closed, we parked at the Red Lake trailhead and worked our way up. Bridge at the very end right before the grotto is no longer there - had to get our feet wet to explore the cove. Google Maps has a good GPS marker for the trailhead."
41,2018-03-28,[''],"I would do this hike again, it's very easy. short and sweet, the actual falls are tiny but pretty."
42,2018-02-11,[''],Beautiful trail but avoid it on holidays!!! Seems like the whole state decides to hike the grotto when they’re out of school!
43,2018-01-28,[''],We went just a couple weeks ago in the snow and it was beautiful! It is a lot longer with the snow because you have to park about 2 miles away from the trail head but it was worth the hike.
44,2017-12-25,['hiking'],Easy and scenic hike got all ages. Carried my one month old here and was fine.
45,2017-11-20,[''],"Awesome. Easy to hike, even covered in snow."
46,2017-11-04,['hiking'],So beautiful
47,2017-11-04,[''],We have done this hike multiple times and it is always enjoyable with the whole family.
48,2017-10-25,[''],This place felt almost magical like in a storybook. The cavelike structure wrapping around the waterfall was breathtaking. Very serene and tranquil. Spent 4hrs here and hated leaving. The drive was very pretty as well.
49,2017-10-23,['hiking'],"Nice trail well maintained, clean and a very easy walk good for all ages and abilities."
50,2017-10-17,[''],"very cool, easy little trail, fun for kids great for dogs becaues had water the whole way up."
51,2017-10-09,['hiking'],Beautiful falls at the end. Easy for the kids 2 & 4 to complete.
52,2017-10-06,['hiking'],Super short easy hike with 6 kids (ages 2-11). They had fun exploring. Leaves are crazy awesome right now! Too short for the distance we drove...tacked on part of another nearby hike.
53,2017-10-02,[''],"Short but beautiful changing autumn leaves,  meandering stream and lovely little grotto."
54,2017-09-30,[''],It was really pretty but way too many people and short.
55,2017-09-24,[''],Very short and easy trail with a beautiful waterfalls
56,2017-09-18,['hiking'],Such a great little stroll! We took her dog and she absolutely loved the stream along the trail and all the interesting smells! Highly recommended. I wish it was a little longer.
57,2017-09-14,['hiking'],Easy trail with little obstacles along the way.  The Grotto offers a handful of fun angles for photographers.
58,2017-09-10,[''],Perfect for little kids. Quick hike with lots to explore
59,2017-08-28,[''],super short but fun. really crowded but worth it.
60,2017-08-25,[''],So many people in such a little space. It would be 5 stars if it were a little less crowded. Beautiful area and very easy 5 minute walk with a cute tree bridge.
61,2017-08-18,['hiking'],Had fun taking my grandkids. Quite busy today though.
62,2017-08-13,[''],Beautiful trail with many side kick trails to the streams. Great places to divert from the main trail. Very short and easy but gorgeous falls with pond below to splash in.
63,2017-08-11,['hiking'],"This was a short but sweet hike! Too like 15 minutes round trip. The fall are very cool, the trail is easy and beautiful! Lots of bridge crossings on the stream. 
Great for little kids."
64,2017-08-06,['hiking'],"Exactly as promised - little kid friendly. Also dog friendly. Heaven help you if you're there with owners who let their dogs run. You'll get wet and knocked over. Bit crowded, but if you're patient, it thins out. Enjoyable short walk up to a beautiful waterfall."
65,2017-07-28,[''],An amazing little surprise!
66,2017-07-25,['hiking'],Short hike with a cool Grotto and waterfall. Easy hike for families with small children. Very pretty
67,2017-07-23,['hiking'],"Short, goes a little uphill. The Grotto was smaller than I expected, but still pretty to see. Expect your feet to get wet at the grotto portion. We went on a Saturday and it was crowded at the end. Recommend going on a weekday. Drive up Payson Canyon was beautiful."
68,2017-07-22,['hiking'],"Great, short hike to a pretty waterfall. Very busy place."
69,2017-07-18,['hiking'],Fun and very kid friendly. We went on a Sunday and it was packed. Had to wait for parking. It is a fun little trail with a pretty water fall.
70,2017-07-15,['hiking'],perfect for all ages! my 3yr old and 60yr old parents. wonderful family activity
71,2017-07-12,[''],Great hike for hikers of all levels. It was pretty busy the Sunday we went... but loved it!!
72,2017-07-09,[''],"When the app said this trail is heavily trafficked, they weren't kidding! It was super busy and crowded, but with that being said, it was a great little hike that offered a huge reward for my whole family. The kids loved it and the actual falls atmosphere and scenery was awesome!"
73,2017-06-30,['hiking'],"A short, easy hike over a few small hills and creeks. The bridges have been washed out and destroyed by recent heavy rains and runoff, but it's still accessible. Prepare to get your feet wet at the end as you enjoy the cool pool and falls at the grotto. Perfect hike for a hot summer day."
74,2017-06-29,['hiking'],Loved it! Best hike so far this summer! The hike was easy and great for families. Short and sweet. The water was low that we were able to walk across the river if needed. Beautiful waterfall! Will definitely be doing this again!
75,2017-06-14,['hiking'],"Super fun, kid-friendly hike."
76,2017-06-11,[''],Very busy area. The last footbridge is a little shaky. You're gonna get you feet wet if you want to go into the alcove so bypass it. Short and sweet.
77,2017-06-10,[''],"Great little hike for kids, especially very young kids. Be prepared, there will be lots of people especially during the summer."
78,2017-06-07,['hiking'],"Short and sweet - plus, it's only 5-10 minutes away from Payson Lakes - all of which are great for kids."
79,2017-05-30,[''],Definitely a lot funner if you just plan on getting wet!
80,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"Super fun, short hike. Be prepared to get your feet wet."
81,2017-05-28,['hiking'],Currently the river is high and some of the bridges are out.  There is also red tape out to prevent you from going on certain areas.  Still it was a great hike!
82,2017-05-26,[''],We absolutely love this trail and scenery. It was so peaceful to hear the waterfall! There is one part that is a bit on the harder side to climb over but other than that the rest was great!
83,2017-05-20,['hiking'],Fun quick hike to a beautiful falls.  River crossings were fun and at least one a little wobbly.
84,2017-05-15,['hiking'],"This hike is perfect for a fun, quick hike. It's absolutely gorgeous and our dog loved playing in the water. The water is really high and you should use caution."
85,2017-05-07,['hiking'],Short hike good for the entire family. Nice reward at the end with a beautiful water fall that at this time has lots of water flowing down. Maybe some muddy areas but nothing to stop you from enjoying this spectacular waterfall. Suggest you take this hike now while there is an abundance of water coming down the mountains.
86,2017-05-07,['hiking'],"Nice short hike. Good for taking kids on for a quick trip outdoors. Be careful in the spring of the run off, we ran into flooded river and had a few difficult spots crossing. If you don't mind getting wet and a little muddy it isn't bad. Nice waterfall at the end of hike."
87,2017-05-06,['hiking'],"Short hike, but nice view at the end"
88,2017-04-27,['hiking'],"Great little hike! The waterfall is very pretty. The river is high right now so you can't really go inside, but you can go on top."
89,2017-04-03,[''],It was still snowy slushy muddy on April first but we had a great time. Oh and we had to hike an additional 1.3 miles to get to the trailhead because the road was still closed.  So a 1.2 mile hike turned into a 3.8 mile hike.
90,2017-03-28,['hiking'],"A beautiful trail no matter what year. I love coming here, even though it's so easy it's one of my favorite trails in Utah!"
91,2017-03-27,[''],My young kids really enjoy it. Beautiful and easy for a family with little ones.
92,2017-03-26,[''],"The trail was quite snowy today, but still hike able. Good hike for kids."
93,2017-03-18,[''],"Quick hike! was pretty cool, worth taking a walk, you get to go over skinny bridges and at the end is a waterfall. My dog loved it, had to go through snow to get there but wasnt difficult at all."
94,2017-03-11,['hiking'],"This hike was absolutely gorgeous!! We did it yesterday and the road to the trail head was closed so we walked on the snow. When you get to the trail itself, it is super snowy and slippery. The frozen waterfall was BEAUTIFUL and so worth it, but I wished we had snow shoes or spikes. Super short and easy hike. We loved it."
95,2017-03-09,[''],Did this hike a few days ago. The road is closed about a mile before the trailhead due to snow so you have to walk through the snow to get there but other than that it was a fun fast hike.
96,2017-02-09,['hiking'],The grotto is a great family hike that I took my four kids on (ages 1-7) without any difficulty.  We went during the summer and as such be warned that it can have very heavy traffic on it.  Fun in the water at the end....well worth it.
97,2016-10-31,[''],"Love this, very kid friendly, nice to do to get out if the Sumner heat"
98,2016-10-24,[''],Very easy and pretty so the kids liked it too!!
99,2016-10-21,['hiking'],Definitely kid friendly easy hike.
100,2016-09-30,[''],super easy but pretty trail.
101,2016-09-25,[''],Extremely easy but the falls are really pretty.
102,2016-09-21,['walking'],Easy. Big payoff for short walk.
103,2016-09-16,['hiking'],"I’ve hiked it a bunch. But I hiked it again with the uploaded GPX file, (I just joined Alltrails). My hobby is geocaching; I didn’t get any on this hike. The fall colors were nice. The trail is easy. I hiked up above the falls this time. It was a nice day for a hike. (and my first completed alltrails one)."
104,2016-09-11,['hiking'],Fun hike with a beautiful waterfall at the end.
105,2016-08-25,['hiking'],"My wife and I went up with our 3 and 6 year old. It was fantastic, the kids could mostly do it then selves with some basic hand holding. They played the grotto and loved it. It wasn't busy because we got there at 4:30 pm. We will do it again."
106,2016-07-30,['hiking'],"The trail features a beautiful deciduous forest that I was surprised to find in Utah, and the grotto is neat. There were TONS of people when I went though, so have fun cropping random people's children out of your photos."
107,2016-07-29,['hiking'],"Easy, shaded trail to a small, but fun waterfall.  Went twice in July and enjoyed cooling off in the falls."
108,2016-07-21,[''],"Short, enjoyable hike-walk. Great for kids and groups that may not be ready for longer hikes. Great reward at the end with waterfall and playing in the water. 
**Warning- would have given 4 stars, but if people are climbing around above the falls, yell at them. There's lots of loose (shale?) rocks. Two of the girls in our group had rocks slide off from above and hit them. "
109,2016-07-12,['walking'],Beautiful Grotto. Narrow pathways. Fun log bridges. Very popular. Kids and I enjoyed ourselves.
110,2016-07-10,[''],"this is an easy trail. it's a fun little exertion.  very busy so don't expect quiet, alone time. the was was chilly in early june, but the kids seemed to love it. the adventure is swimming under a waterfall."
111,2016-07-10,['nature trips'],"Although very short, this is a nice stroll and you can take kids who are new to walking."
112,2016-07-06,[''],Easy as it gets. Beautiful trail. Love all the bridge crossings :)kids loved it.
113,2016-07-05,[''],"Short, sweet and cool. Perfect hike for littles and people just getting into hiking."
114,2016-07-05,[''],"Easy, cool ending with a waterfall."
115,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Took us 30 minutes up and back, including the time we took at the waterfall. There were lots of people on the trail which made it slightly difficult at times (some parts of the trail are super narrow, so we'd have to wait for people to come before we could go). This was at around 12:30pm on a Saturday. We took our 4 month old baby and she seemed to enjoy it as well. In my opinion, it's more than a nature walk, but not super strenuous either due to the fact that it's so short. Bonus: you can go any time of day since the trail is very shady and breezy. If it's super hot outside, it doesn't affect you as much."
116,2016-06-20,[''],"This is really just a great nature walk for the kids. Nice path, fun places to climb and jump, and a little waterfall to play in at the end."
117,2016-06-18,['hiking'],It was a nice short hike! I loved the wood bridges to cross and the water fall at the end. Simple hike!
118,2016-06-16,['hiking'],"It's a nice trail.  We took our dogs and we were impressed by how family and doc friendly the trail was.  I agree with all of the other reviews it is definitely short and not strenuous at all but that's why we picked it for a quick after work, week night hike.  Just enough to exhaust the puppies.  I would suggest it to people with children that want to have a fun hike but not too long."
119,2016-06-05,['walking'],It's a walk. Not a hike.
120,2016-06-02,[''],It was a nice little walk and the waterfall is pretty!
121,2016-05-31,['hiking'],Trail was not difficult.
122,2016-05-30,[''],"I don't know if I'd consider it a ""hike"", but it was a fun and gorgeous ""saunter"". :) The little kids loved all the little bridges and the water was fun to play in."
123,2016-05-19,['hiking'],It's easy enough that I usually wear my sandals and it takes about 10-15 minutes to reach the falls. Good quickie when time is limited.
124,2016-02-21,['hiking'],"Nebo Loop was closed about 2.5 miles from the trailhead. The snow is fairly packed down from snowmobiles. There are branches and a few trees down farther up, but it wasn't a problem to go around them. The snow gets real deep once you start on the actual trail. You have a narrow snow pack, and stepping off it would make you sink about 2 feet. Bring those gaiters! There is another tree down across the trail, and you'll have to climb over it. You'll have to cross a few log bridges before you reach the falls, and they're a little slippery. The falls are magnificent. It's a bit longer of a hike during the winter, but it is still very much worth it."
125,2015-10-21,[''],My husband and I took our new puppy on this trail and it was so easy. We got in and out in like 20 mins. It's a good hike and doesn't take very long. I would advise planning other hikes during the day because it doesn't take very long.
126,2015-09-12,['walking'],A perfect hike for small children. It's easy and short with a perfect little splash pool and waterfall at the end! The kids loved the timber bridges all along the trail.
127,2015-09-05,['hiking'],short but refreshing on a hot day
128,2015-08-19,[''],This is a perfect length hike for an afternoon adventure. Not hard and the waterfall is worth it
129,2015-08-03,['hiking'],Great short hike! We hike it several times each year. Very child friendly. It only takes about 30 minutes roundtrip. For pictures and more information about this hike and other waterfall hikes in the area visit: http://www.yourhikeguide.com/the-grotto-nebo-loop/
130,2015-07-15,['hiking'],Fun easy hike with the grandkids. Great family hike
131,2015-07-13,['hiking'],Easy trail with a beautiful waterfall at the end. This was the first trail I went barefoot on.
132,2015-07-07,['hiking'],Pretty fun little hike. Great for a hot summer day as there is plenty of tree cover and a waterfall.  I took the cub scouts and they had a good time hiking around it and to the top of the fall. Very easy but usage is more moderate than light.
133,2015-07-05,[''],"Sweetness! 
An added adventure the little ones enjoyed was climbing to the top"
134,2015-07-03,[''],Fun hike
135,2015-06-30,[''],Super easy and fun. Beautiful falls.
136,2015-06-29,[''],"Fun quick hike with the kiddos. Sad to see so much trash on the trail, probably due to the popularity of the hike. Wished there were fewer people."
137,2015-06-28,['walking'],"Great trail to get out of the house. We took sandals so we can hang out in the water, and was not disappointed. Easy enough for a calm walk."
138,2015-06-27,['hiking'],"Very easy hike. Fun to do with little kids. I wish it were less crowded, but its popularity is understandable."
139,2015-05-25,['hiking'],"Easy kid friendly hike. Cool water, great on a hot summer day. Tons of shade and easy to follow trail."

141,2014-08-07,[''],Great family hike!  Even my two year old could get in and out with no complaining. Short and quick. We also had a moose run by us.
142,2014-07-24,['nature trips'],"Easy for the whole family to hike. Short enough that even little kids don't get ""bored"" with the hike."
143,2014-07-07,['hiking'],"It's actually up Payson canyon,  fyi."
144,2014-04-12,[''],"It's in Payson, not Santiquin."
145,2013-08-18,['hiking'],"This hike is more like a scenic nature walk. The whole trail is beautiful as you cross creeks and eventually come to the waterfall. Can be a bit crowded, so I usually go earlier in the day when kids are in school. Can also be a fun picnic spot with kids so they can play in the water (just be sure to clean up after!) "
146,2013-08-04,['hiking'],Very beautiful nature walk.  Easy for kids. Take a stroll above the waterfall
147,2013-06-02,['hiking'],"Very quick hike, more nature walk .  Perfect for little kids.  Very popular.  GPS from Alltrails lost navigation direction shortly after entering the canyon but trailhead is well marked. "
148,2013-05-22,['hiking'],"B-E-A-UTIFUL!!! And easy, almost too easy.  The trail is quite well constructed.  I went last week (mid-may), cool but not cold.  A fair amount of traffic and a bit of litter on the trail ( yes, I picked up what I could.  I didn't have a bag.), but still definitely stunning.  Only wish my battery didn't die on me, I wanted more pictures!!"
149,2013-04-24,['hiking'],Did this hike late in the season when there was already snow.  It was beautiful!
150,2012-09-16,['hiking'],"I took my family on this hike on a Saturday around 2pm and it wasn't very crowded. My kids (7&4) had a great time. If your kids like playing in the creek and getting wet, this is a perfect hike. We really enjoyed it. "
151,2012-06-17,['hiking'],"Fast and easy hike for families. Took our very small children and they dis fine. Can get very crowded, but the grotto is fun."
152,2012-06-17,['hiking'],Easy hike But extremely busy with tons of kids. Pretty with lots of vegetation.
153,2012-04-21,['hiking'],"Short, easy hike, beautiful all the way up. The only drawback is that it is a very popular hike and gets crowded."
154,2012-04-10,['hiking'],"Great, easy hike and beautiful.  Great for small kids."
155,2012-01-09,['hiking'],Great easy first hike for a beginner or small children.  Lots of fun to play in the water at the grotto.
156,2011-12-24,['hiking'],This hike is short and easy.  There's no excuse for anyone who's in the area to miss this. Absolutely beautiful.
