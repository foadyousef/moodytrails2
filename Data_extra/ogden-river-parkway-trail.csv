0,2019-09-04,[''],Great trail for a stroller run!! A little bumpy.
1,2019-08-29,['hiking'],easy paved trail. courteous bikers.
2,2019-08-11,['road biking'],"Beautiful, diverse trail. Fun to see parts of Ogden you wouldn't normally see driving around. Shaded 90% of the time. You see everything from botanical gardens, to dinosaurs, to the famous swimming pool from The Sandlot, to cows if you go farther west. "
3,2019-08-02,['hiking'],only half of the trail
4,2019-06-08,[''],"we always start at the ogden botanical gardens and walk the trail to the end near the waterfall, and go up the Dee park loop my kids an I love this route we've done it several times and plan to keep going back!!!  defenitly are favorite trail. even if we don't do the whole thing. "
5,2019-06-03,['trail running'],This place is my 2nd home. I try to walk or run the trail 3 to 4 times a week. Beautiful and peaceful. Always feel better after leaving there!
6,2019-04-26,['mountain biking'],This was the first trail I rode on and I love it. Wall and Washington are currently flooded so you have to dodge traffic.  I like to take the shoreline trail from rainbow gardens south drop down to South Ogden to Uintah and hook to this trail in Riverdale.  26 mile ride.
7,2018-10-22,[''],"Just agreeing with other 5 star reviews. This path is an absolutely incredible treasure. Among recreation amenities in general it ranks up there with anything Utah has to offer, and among urban riparian greenways it is probably in the top 10 in the US. If Utah had a more coherent way of managing its human-nature interface, this path and the ecosystem it is part of would put Ogden on the international map as an internationally desirable place to live."
8,2018-07-20,['walking'],I love this trail as it runs by the river. I spent my childhood walking a long it.
9,2018-06-24,['road biking'],I hit the trail early in the morning (0630) the wind was blowing pretty well coming from the east like it does most days.   It is paved all the way and is marked for the most part.  I got off trail one time because I missed the sign for the trail (the orange arrows on the ground) they donâ€™t say they are for the trail but they are.  There are more arrows with different colors for other trails.   I read in the reviews there were a lot of homeless around.   I only saw 2 or 3 and they were closer to the Washington st.   There are a lot of places to stop and enjoy the river and cool off.  Over all the trail is a nice ride if you want to get the family out and riding.

11,2018-05-14,['mountain biking'],Very fun my first trail so far perfect for a family ride
12,2018-04-25,['walking'],Lots of homeless.  :(
13,2018-03-18,['fishing'],I walk this path for the small river fly fishing. Tons of river access all along the path.
14,2017-08-11,[''],Really pretty scenic paved path along the Ogden river that runs all the way through the city. Some parts are nice near riverdale but other parts near north ogden can be kinda sketchy with druggie folks in underpasses
15,2017-08-06,['walking'],"Great place to walk, run, or bike. Beautiful trail along the Ogden River."
16,2017-06-01,['road biking'],"I love the Ogden River Parkway, it's a place to get outside without having to drive to the mountains. I ride my bike, run, and rollerblade it  every summer.  The downside is the stretch from Rainbow Garden to about Washington Blvd are ridiculously crowded in the evenings. It's nice to see people out enjoying it but no one stays to the right to let other pass, dogs on leashes on one side with the owner on the other...when you're biking or rollerblading this gets annoying real fast. I wish people were a little more aware of their surroundings. My solution to this problem has been to start at the pond behind Walmart and go West along the trail from there. You won't run into many people and if you do they are generally people riding bikes, or homeless and I've never had a problem with either. The real problem right now is the high water covering the trail at nearly every underpass and for rollerblading, where the water has receded off the trail,  there are big stretched of dirt and debris that knock you off balance. Still it's one of my favorite places to burn off some energy after work."
17,2017-05-26,['trail running'],Trail is closed at some sections due to high water.
18,2017-04-18,[''],"This was a great trail for me and my young kids. Very clean and well kept for the most part. I like that you get to walk near dinosaurs and through the botanical gardens. The path also goes by a playground and picnic areas with restrooms. The restrooms near the botanical gardens were open on Easter, but I'd recommend bringing your own TP."
19,2017-04-17,[''],"Very busy, but great easy walk."
20,2017-02-23,['walking'],"great for walking,  biking,  roller blading and just getting out to exercise."
21,2016-11-01,[''],I love the parkway
22,2016-09-06,[''],"Very fun trail , we biked it in about 4 hours 
Starting at Rainbow Gardens ending near Weber Canyon on I-84 . 
Up and back 22 miles 
One of the best times I'v ever had riding a bike"
23,2016-09-06,['road biking'],"Good trail for a run, walk or for biking. Super easy. There are always a lot of people on the trail, and many people off the trail. I'm not too fond of the trail in the dark because there are so many transients next to it at night. But it is a great trail during the day and you can get on at several locations around Ogden. I use this trail very often from spring to fall."
24,2016-05-31,['walking'],"Okay, fairly level, lots of people even for a weekday."
25,2016-05-30,[''],"This is an extremely relaxing trail, which is paved in its entirety. There was quite a bit of bike traffic while we were there"
26,2015-10-18,['walking'],Trail was nice!  Paved surface throughout!  Nice people saying high and smiling! Dogs on leashes!
27,2015-04-07,['mountain biking'],"Great trail for walking, running, skating and biking. This trail can get heavy use at times so if you are biking keep an eye out for walkers and runners. This trail spans from the mouth of the canyon west past I-15 and ever turns south and runs clear to Riverdale. Fun trail for the whole family."
28,2015-04-04,['road biking'],Great trail for biking if you can beat the crowds. Rode it from rainbow gardens then merged with the weber river parkway trail down to West Haven. It can get pretty busy once its warm enough for the crowds to come out.
29,2015-02-17,['road biking'],"Great for hiking, biking, running, or a nice walk. 
Ogden River Parkway provides a great easy family hike or bike.  This trail is paved and crosses a handful of parks so the kids will love it.  Take bathing suites with you, as there are a couple of great swimming holes along the way.  We have nicknamed one of our favorites ""the Zoom Floom"" which is located right off of the parkway trail, very near the Walmart just past ""Wall Street"".  Stop in for lunch at the Slack Water.  They have good pizza and sandwiches, and an awesome beer selection.  You can sit right on the river and park you bike next to the tables."
30,2012-08-24,['mountain biking'],Picturesque biking / walking trail that is paved until it meets with the Weber River trail which is also paved. The Ogden trail runs along the Ogden river and has some hills and changing landscape that makes it a lot of fun  for us when we want some quick cardio without having to drive too far.
31,2012-08-16,['walking'],Easy paved trail by the Eccles Dinosaur Park. Very pretty during the fall time. 
32,2012-07-23,['hiking'],"I'd say the best way to enjoy the Ogden River Parkway is on a cruiser bike with kids.  It's flat, pretty, goes through a variety of scenery (and behind the dinorsaur park), and can connect to a variety of other trails.  It makes for a nice stroll too.  Too busy for real road biking though, which is a pity given the beautiful paved surface."
33,2012-05-28,['hiking'],"Easy stroll on a paved trail along the river.  Several parks and picnic areas along the way.   Trail is pretty level the entire length.  Great for a leisurely stroll or a jog.   This would be a great trail for someone just beginning hiking or looking to loose some weight, very easy."
