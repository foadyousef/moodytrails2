1,2019-08-07,['hiking'],"I wanted a longer hike to the peak so I started at the lookout and trekked across the front of the mountain. It was a great hike! That first stretch is pretty exposed and gets really hot during the day because there’s no shade, but the trail is well established and easy to follow. Great views out to the valley and up rock canyon as well. I’d definitely do it again. Saw a huge wolf spider, falcon, and a flock of about 9 turkeys."
2,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"I was excited to find a trail that wasn’t a long haul, and had good terrain for my two grandkids (ages 3 & 4). Both children were able to accomplish the hike with very little difficulty. A great first hiking experience for them both. The view was absolutely beautiful! We also crossed paths with about 20 pheasants...which was awesome. "
3,2019-07-12,['hiking'],"Best to hike for sunset (heavy traffic so go in the AM if you want a solitary feel), right after rain, and spring/fall IMO. Perfect for a little hike date. Also sorry to preach... but if you go, don’t go walk on the branched-off paths. They are there because people want cool pictures. Lets let the flowers grow.

"
4,2019-07-04,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Flowers are in bloom but mosquitoes are also. Bring bug spray. Gets busy with photographers before dusk.
5,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"Easy hike to get a great view of the city. We went in the evening and waited for sunset. As the sun sets, the lights of the city come alive. There is about 3 miles of rough dirt road to the trail head, so keep that in mind. Lastly, make sure you bring insect repellent. "
6,2019-06-27,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Such a quick and beautiful hike. We saw lots of wildflowers and the mosquitoes are out in full force. The road was totally clear of mud and snow. 
7,2019-06-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, spectacular views, very accessable hike. Wonderful way to spend an afternoon."
8,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Short and sweet hike. My young family loved it. Road was rutted but dry. As long as you are paying attention you will be fine in a low clearance 2wd. We were in a Honda Odyssey and had no problems. As mentioned by others, the last little bit is a bit of a scramble, but I just held my four year old's hand and she was fine. "
9,2019-06-15,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. The road leading to trailhead was not sedan friendly.  The last quarter mile of the hike was steep with many loose rocks. Walking stick helped tremendously.  Trail was not muddy. view at the end was breathtaking.  Can't wait to come back in a couple of weeks and see the wildflowers bloom. 
10,2019-06-15,['hiking'],"Short and sweet. Views are incredible. I wore sandals thinking it was only a mile. I was okay, but a lot of people were having issues coming down off the peak.  It was pretty rocky and loose.  Only for 1/8 mile, but you may want to be aware."
11,2019-06-02,['hiking'],"I loved the trail, you’ll probably need 4wd to get to it. Really pretty in the spring."
12,2018-10-27,[''],
13,2018-10-01,['hiking'],"A beautiful, short hike. Lots of flowers, bees, and birds in the late spring and a few small meadows and lookouts. The main overlook is stunning and there is a flat space at the top perfect for a picnic. There is also a meadow half way up where we relaxed and had some snacks. If you turn off the trail occasionally there are some little overlooks along the way. 

A great hike for beginners, kids, and those looking to take a short trip into nature."
14,2018-09-22,['hiking'],Beautiful late afternoon hike with fall colors and great views of mountains and valley. Relatively easy and quick hike to summit. Heavily used trail.
15,2018-09-04,[''],Great views with a relatively easy and short ascent.  Some very steep sections toward the end but all in all it is a pretty doable hike. A little hazy still from the fires but the views were still comparable to those you would get on Squaw.
16,2018-08-10,[''],"We looked all over Utah valley area trying to find a good hike for our small family reunion—something young kids, grandparents and pregnant women could do but also something that outdoor enthusiasts and avid hikers would enjoy. This hike was perfect. The drive is scenic and beautiful. The trail is lovely, albeit short, with meadows and (sometimes) flowers and spectacular views right off the path. The view right before the last ascent of the hike is lovely, and those who felt unable to climb the last bit felt satisfied to stay there. The views at the top are splendid though, and it’s not a long climb up the steep part. We enjoyed this trail so much we’ve been back twice since."
17,2018-08-05,[''],Great easy hike with incredible views. Our 3yo hiked the whole way no problem.
18,2018-07-07,[''],Beautiful! 5 and 6 year old did it with no problem.
19,2018-07-03,['hiking'],Stunning! Definitely worth going at sunset.
20,2018-06-29,['hiking'],"I went with my 9 and 7 year olds.  It’s an easy hike, even for kids except the last hill which is pretty steep and covered in rocks.  My kids were still able to do it without problem, but it was slower on the way down because of the rocks.  The trail head was hard to find.  We tried our gps which took us to the wrong place, but then we opened up this app and we’re able to figure out where to go from there.  The flowers were absolutely beautiful and the view was amazing!  It’s a fantastic short hike."
21,2018-06-27,['hiking'],"Difficult to find the real trailhead as there are a couple of spots to stop before the real place that eventually join the trail after long walks through open fields. The best stop will have a fire prevention sign immediately on the left and a fence to crawl under on the right. 

Beware of rattlesnakes as we saw one right on the edge of the trail halfway to top. It gave us enough warning so I could snatch my 5 year old out of the way but just be alert for them, as always in Utah."
22,2018-06-22,[''],"Finally made it to the peak with Hike it Baby Utah County! Such a fun trail, kid friendly. We had a 2.5 yr old who hiked all the way to the top with his mom's help as it gets real steep at the end. Beautiful wild flowers our right now."
23,2018-06-19,['hiking'],"Pretty easy hike, although the hike up to the peak was a little rocky and a tad more difficult than I was expecting but it was still relatively easy! Beautiful views and incredibly pretty wildflowers along the trail!"
24,2018-06-03,['hiking'],lots of fun. breathtaking views. good trail.
25,2018-05-31,[''],Short but an excellent view. A little hard to find the trailhead- there were two or three times before the actual start that we thought was the beginning. It really is about a 30 minute drive up the road.
26,2018-05-23,['hiking'],The road is open and there was no snow!
27,2018-05-20,[''],"Gorgeous. We went up in the afternoon and stayed while the sun set. It's a very short hike, great for dogs!"
28,2018-05-20,[''],A really pretty hike with incredible views! It was really easy in my opinion.
29,2018-05-08,[''],"Road still closed, but go soon to see the wild flowers!"
30,2017-11-25,[''],ROAD CLOSED FOR WINTER 
31,2017-10-15,[''],Very beautiful hike and great for kids!
32,2017-10-05,['hiking'],
33,2017-08-26,['hiking'],"I am the kind of person that considers a hike to be walking on a paved path beside a water bed. So this was going out of my comfort zone. I’m not in shape, and I am anemic so hiking is difficult for me. 

The trail was easy the whole way until the last 100 feet or so. I stopped maybe 5-6 times to catch my breath before I made it to the top...so if I can do it you can too! 

The scenery was gorgeous, views were beautiful. You won’t be disappointed. I noticed that the very top didn’t have much a view though...the best point is the landing right before the last climb. That’s actually where you’ll find the best view. 

We drove up to the trail in our Jetta and didn’t pop a tire so if you are going in a car just take it slow and you should be fine."
34,2017-08-21,['hiking'],Loved doing this hike at sunset!
35,2017-07-25,['hiking'],"Short hike and great views of Provo and the surrounding area. The dirt road getting up to the trail is rough, so make sure whatever you're driving can handle the bumpy dirt road."
36,2017-07-19,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail and views! Short easy hike, great if your short on time. The road getting there is a dirt road and is quite  bumpy so make sure your car can handle it"
37,2017-07-09,[''],"It was a good trail, very easy, not hard at all. If it was longer, it'd have been challenging. You should try to time the hike so you summit at sunset, otherwise it isn't that pretty. I also don't like that it overlooks the city which is kind of the opposite of what I want to see on a hike."
38,2017-07-07,['hiking'],"Super fun, super short trail with some great scenic views. The last little bit is the hardest, but it doesn't last long. We went before sunrise and got some beautiful pictures to the south of the sunrise."
39,2017-07-07,['hiking'],The best view for the shortest amount of hike time...it was awesome
40,2017-07-04,[''],Amazing view from the top. Never realized a peak in Utah county provided a view of Utah Lake and Salt Lake both. Awesome sunset!
41,2017-06-28,[''],great for kids! a bit steep at the end climb for 3 year old but with a hand to hold she made it! views were beautiful!
42,2017-06-23,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike that is not difficult but has many wildflowers, overlooks, and a beautiful view at the top. There are several ways to get to the top so having this AllTrails app handy helped with navigation. We went last Saturday mid-morning and passed probably seven other small groups. We also saw a dead rattlesnake on the path and so were glad we wore long pants. Excellent weather this time of year and some shade cover. We saw a few little kids (ages 5 or 6) on the summit with us and they seemed to do great!"
43,2017-06-13,[''],
44,2017-06-10,[''],This hike was very easy! Like said in other reviews the last stretch is completely an incline uphill! But the views on this hike make up for it!!! The drive up is longer than the hike and a dirt road leads the way for about 3 miles (for car care).
45,2017-06-09,['hiking'],"Really nice, short summit hike. I enjoyed the views the entire little way. Yes it got a tad steep at the end on loose rock, but we did it. And we had a 4 year old and a 2 year old. The kids loved it. We went midday in June and it was breezy and we didn't have bug problems 

Road was fine, I could have driven a smart car up it!"
46,2017-06-01,['hiking'],Nice little hike. The last part up to the top is steep and some loose rock. Beautiful views.
47,2017-05-29,['hiking'],Quick and easy hike. A nice way to start off the hiking season.
48,2017-05-28,[''],"Such a fun little hike. We took my daughters and nephews. There were parts that were pretty steep, but because it was so short it was really doable with the kids. They loved it when we got to the top and we told them they bagged their first peak. Haha. Great views and really just a good, fun time."
49,2017-05-26,['hiking'],Short hike to great views!
50,2017-04-17,['hiking'],"hiked this from the squaw peak overlook TH yesterday.  Fairly easy hike, climbed about 1300 vertical feet going out 2 miles. Great views of the Provo/Orem and Utah Lake area below the mountain.  Hiked through snow starting about a mile from the TH at 7200'.  Walked back on the road which was also covered in snow and closed to all but ATV/snowmobile vehicles.  Great place for sledding and cross country skiing."
51,2016-10-16,['hiking'],"This was a really fun short hike for the whole family. The trail was nice and there was a steep climb towards the end but totally worth it! The views were incredible of Utah Lake and the valley! There were several areas set up for campfires, something we will be back here to do next time. When you are driving up you hit a gravel road which is bumpy and takes a good 20 minutes until you hit the trailhead which is on your right. Our mid sized crossover made it up there just fine and we saw a lot of non 4WD vehicles up there as well so don't worry! Great hike, definitely will do this again!"
52,2016-10-10,['hiking'],"This was a relatively easy trail, except for the very end where it gets pretty steep. The terrain at the end also can be a little slippery. But overall, this is an easy trail you could knock out in less than an hour. The views are absolutely stunning."
53,2016-09-18,[''],"Great, short and beautiful hike!"
54,2016-09-04,[''],Gorgeous views!  A bit steep in places for out-of-shapers; that is mostly at the end 
55,2016-08-29,[''],Great hike to do with all ages! Gorgeous views!
56,2016-08-25,['hiking'],Fun easy hike with a great view of Utah valley.
57,2016-07-13,['hiking'],Great hike went with my 7 year old and 10 month old. Just wish it would of been a bit longer it was a lot easier than I expected but overall beautiful hike with great views of the valley.
58,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"Best way to enjoy this hike is to do the 4 mile loop, starting at the Squaw Peak Overlook, where you go behind one way and enjoy the view of the valley the other. There is a much shorter version starting just past Hope Campground if you want a quick jaunt. Great for families."
59,2016-07-05,[''],"One of the most beautiful hikes in Utah County that's considered ""easy"" - the loose rock & steep ending compare to the Y not hard at all (& I'm a baby) also the views are out of this world - there's one stopping point but keep going up & then it looks like it stops again - keep going - you'll thank me! The only downside to this hike is the dirt road for 2.7 miles... I have a little car that barely survived it... I'd actually consider walking the dirt road and then doing this hike next time...."
60,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Nice short hike to give the kids a taste for views.  We led four of our kids (and carried the fifth) to the summit and let them enjoy the satisfaction of reaching the top of a peak.  We went in the fall a few years ago, and we frequently point out the peak as we drive along I-15.  This is a great hike for non-hikers."
61,2016-07-01,['hiking'],Really short hike but so pretty!
62,2016-06-27,['hiking'],"I went in mid-June and it was beautiful. Lots of flowers, and pretty short. There are some areas that would be great for camping as well."
63,2016-06-22,['hiking'],"We started the trail lower so we could hike a bit longer (2.2 miles round trip) and then merged onto the main, short,  buffalo peak trail. It was quiet and peaceful until the merge. Gradual ascent until the end which was pretty steep, but the kids handled it fine. There is little shade and it was hot. I read the reviews to bring bug spray and dismissed them. I swear all reviews say it and it had never been a big deal. WRONG. Bring bug spray!!! That was the biggest complaint from the kids, not the heat or the steep climb, but the bugs. I left with three huge swollen bites on my leg."
64,2016-06-22,[''],"Beautiful hike, the flowers and the view were amazing. It was pretty easy so no complaints at all"
65,2016-06-20,[''],"We loved it! Beautiful flowers and amazing views! Very easy hike, great for our young kids. A little tough at the end but very doable. Enjoy"
66,2016-06-15,['hiking'],Great hike! like the other reviews said it is easy but a little tougher at the end with some loose rocks. Great views throughout the hike! Even saw a few horny toads :)
67,2016-06-13,['hiking'],Nice and easy. Little push at the end. The wildflowers were amazing. Make sure to wear bug spray.
68,2016-06-06,[''],Pretty easy hike with a great view. Did run into a rattle snake so heads up.
69,2016-06-06,['hiking'],In a few more days the wild flowers will be incredible.
70,2016-06-04,[''],"Such a great day hike. Pretty Easy climb except for the last part it becomes a little steep, but not to bad. the views are great as well."
71,2016-06-04,['hiking'],"Fun hike with littles. 4 y/o needed to hold hands through the final push. Same with the 3 y/o. Take it slow, a beautiful overlook awaits. Dirt road was well maintained. Handled it with a mini van, no problem. Had some scouts camping along the trail early Saturday AM, but other than that, we were all but alone."
72,2016-06-03,[''],"fun little hike. wish you didn't have to take a dirt road out to the trail though. but great for kids. 
you can also park at squaw peak overlook and bike to it, but that is much longer."
73,2016-05-31,[''],great for kids!
74,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"Short and easy. Only gets a little more difficult near the peak where there are a lot of loose rocks on the steep climb. So beautiful, and such cool views of Utah County."
75,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"Short, easy with a 2 year old and a baby in a backpack, and wonderful views! Worth it for a quick hike."
76,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"I needed a quick hick due to time constraints.  So I didn't expect much but an easy, fast hike.  But not only was this hike short and quick, it was beautiful.  Wonderful scenery. Great hike for all ages.  Even an overweight, lowlander like me. I would highly recommend if you don't have the time or physical ability for a longer hike.  Great to get the kids or a beginner interested in hiking."
77,2016-05-29,[''],great view!
78,2015-10-01,['hiking'],"I think this is a great family hike. My kids loved feeling like they were on top of the world. It's a great chance to be on top of a peak, with only a very quick, short hike. 

That being said, even though this is short and ""easy"" the final ascent to the peak is very steep. Just be aware if you have bad knees or aren't in great health."
79,2015-09-07,['hiking'],"I am out of shape with horrible knees and joints which is why I picked this hike for our family of teens to do on Labor Day morning.  We arrived at the trail head about 10:00 a.m. and it was exactly as described...right across from a sign that said “Protect Your Wildland Playground” .  The sign is on the left side of the road and trail head is on the right side of the road.  The trail is easy to follow.  The end gets very steep with loose rocks all over the trail which makes for treacherous ascending and descending.  I have hiking poles which greatly help my aching knees and gave me more stability on the loose rock.

I am giving this 5 stars because it is a ""real"" hike--IE. in the mountains, and offers great views, and leaves you wanting to go hiking again. It's a great beginner hike or for the old, out of shape, or young. I think everyone could do it.   The colors were just starting to turn on Labor Day 2015.  In another week or so, I imagine the surrounding mountains will be ablaze with color.  We walked through a field of dried out wild flowers that I'm guessing where beautiful yellow earlier in the summer."
80,2015-08-16,['hiking'],"Easy hike, steep with some loose rock right before the top. Beautiful views of Utah valley."
81,2015-08-04,['hiking'],"We always hike Buffalo Peak when we go camping up Squaw Peak Road. This is about 1.0 mile roundtrip, and can be done in 45 minutes or less. As mentioned the last part is a little steep, with some small, loose rock on the trail, but nothing dangerous about it.

The best view is actually found at a rock outcropping just before the final push to the top. From this outcropping, looking south you get great views of Y Mountain, Provo Peak, Shingle Mill Peak, and Freedom Peak. Even though Squaw Peak is the prominent peak in Provo, Buffalo Peak is actually 300 feet higher than Squaw Peak but doesn't have the dramatic profile Squaw Peak has.

Road can be a little rutted to get there, but passenger cars should be able to reach the trailhead, if driven with care. Great hike to do in the early fall as the leaves begin to change."
82,2015-07-28,['hiking'],"Super short hike, easy but last section is step. Great view of the valley."
83,2015-06-28,['hiking'],This was a fun short hike perfect for all ages. I would do this again.
84,2015-06-28,['hiking'],"In terms of distance/difficulty to rewarding view this is a great hike. short, slightly steep, but pretty easy. the drive is tougher than the whole hike but I would come back to camp along here."
85,2015-06-16,['hiking'],I really enjoyed this hike. I started from sunset peak making it a little over 2 miles hike. If you're a super beginner (like I am) there are a few points that are a bit strenuous but nothing you can't push through. Did my first solo hike on this and would definitely do it again.
86,2015-06-14,[''],Depending on where you start this can be a longer or shorter hike (1 mile round trip... or 4). There are some inclines but nothing too crazy. Overall a good hike and good views.
87,2015-06-05,[''],"My wife was a bit apprehensive about getting into hiking. We started with this short, easy trail with an amazing view from the summit. She downloaded the app afterwards and is planning more hikes! This is a great trail for beginners, or those like myself who are trying to get back into hiking after a long hiatus. The end is a bit steep, but so worth it. Awesome camping spots on the way up also. I'll definitely be coming back to this one."
88,2015-06-02,['hiking'],"The thing you need to know about this hike is that it has three different trailheads or access points! (Making this a one mile, two mile and four mile hike round trip!) Two of the trailheads are located up a moderately rugged dirt road. Loved this hike when we did it on Saturday! It has gorgeous mountain views, lake views and city views. For more info on this hike you can check out my blog post (which include a map and GPS coordinates) here: http://wanderookie.com/blog/2015/06/01/buffalo-peak-the-triple-threat-trail/"
89,2015-02-04,['hiking'],"Great, short, and easy hike. The drive up has some impressive views too. Parking can sometimes be an issue if you do a Saturday hike. If you're looking for a quick, easy hike in the Provo area, this one is for you."
90,2013-10-07,['hiking'],"This was a absolutely stunning place to hike around, though it only takes about an hour, I was hiking around for hours enjoying the scenery and wildlife. There were deer, large snakes, and even moose. It's definitely beautiful."
91,2012-07-23,['hiking'],"Short, easy hike that offers great views of the valley and surrounding mountains. It took me 45 minutes but could be done in a half hour. The drive up to the trailhead is beautiful especially in fall."
92,2012-07-13,['hiking'],"The view at the top is great, but it will take you longer to drive there than to hike the trail. Be ready for a winding and rock filled drive to the trailhead. Instead of this hike, consider the squaw peak hike. The view is the same but squaw peak is less of a hassle to get to."
93,2012-05-26,['hiking'],"A short hike with a nice view of the whole Utah valley. No parking at trailhead, but it is a short enough hike that it's not much of a problem. I took two of my boys and our small dog finished the whole thing in under an hour. "
