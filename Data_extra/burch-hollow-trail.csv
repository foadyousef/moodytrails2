0,2019-09-08,['hiking'],nice work out. pretty views. lots of vegetation so I agree that pants should be worn. saw no one on after the burch hollow trailhead. saw a rattle snake and some deer.
1,2019-07-06,"['hiking', 'over grown']","nice hike in morning (mostly shaded)
two sections - 1.5 mi easy along pipeline; 1.6 mi  consistently uphill.
Nice quiet uphill with wildflowers and views at top.

tips - long pants and bring plenty of water for dogs"
2,2019-07-02,"['trail running', 'over grown']","I feel so so about this trail. I liked the remoteness and the fact that I only saw two people while hiking, but the brush and vegetation are no joke. The views at the top are pretty neat with a little rock/cliff formation that appears to be a  climbing spot. I would recommend hiking this in the early spring or late fall when the vegetation isn't as thick."
3,2019-06-20,['hiking'],"Great views along the way and at the top. The trail gets very narrow after the turn off of pipeline, which required a lot of trudging through overgrown shrubs and branches...wear long pants and hat and it's no trouble. "

5,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']","This trail starts on the Pipeline trail and is in great condition, but pretty busy with trail runners and bikers. Once you take the fork into Burch Hollow it gets steeper and more overgrown. The fork is not marked, so just keep your eye out on the left side or follow along the AllTrails map. The trail is obvious all the way to the top, which is just the top of the ridge, but right now (June) you'll be brushing through bushes and sticks. It's pretty shaded in the morning but not so much in the afternoon until you get back to the Pipeline trail. Good workout though, we did it in about 5 hours but that includes rests and side explorations. Not a lot of water on the trail so bring plenty extra if you have a dog. Nice views and flowers at the top."
6,2019-06-03,['muddy'],my son and I had fun today on this trail. we didn't hike to the top. Got there just before 11am and it was pretty busy but still had a lot of fun. Some areas are still very muddy so just keep that in mind. the trail is starting to get very warm.

8,2019-05-27,['hiking'],Great hike! Trail is narrow and steep once you get up to Burch hollow trail. Also very private. Saw a few snakes and lizards :) 
9,2019-05-11,"['trail running', 'over grown']",I liked the amount of vert once you turned off the pipeline. I will remember this descent as the run of a thousand lashings. Seriously not meant to run.

11,2019-05-03,['hiking'],I really enjoyed this trail with my pup. We went on a Saturday.. and surprisingly it wasn’t near as busy as all of the other trails were. There were a couple of small patches of snow-those were to be expected. The trail is well maintained and there’s a lot of really pretty views all the way up.

13,2019-03-06,['hiking'],Mushy and icy today.  Bring yaktrax or similar.  Only saw two people today

15,2018-10-23,['hiking'],"Just a note — @Beth Persons commented in April 2017 of having hiked this and continued on to Grandeur Peak. Please note that isn't an official trail and crosses private property. The Forest Service has erroneously showed it as a trail on some recent maps, but have told me they are correcting it on future printings."
16,2018-09-08,['hiking'],"Dogs do not have to be on a leash on odd days
Trail is easy to find if you're looking for it.
A little overgrown, if you like highway trails, very overgrown and steep."
17,2018-08-18,['hiking'],the trail was over grown and a little steep but it was fun and secluded. we didn't run into any other hikers after we got into the Burch Trail. pretty views of Milcreek canyon.
18,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"Magnificent views up top as you're standing over a ridge that overlooks the side to the Great Salt Lake and most sides of the city. But the trail is extremely overgrown. You'll have to walk through very thick vegetation with wildflowers that are buzzing with tons of bees and different insects. Wear pants if you want this challenge. 

Someone with a machete please help clear this great trail!"
19,2018-07-01,['hiking'],Much of it is on pipeline which if full of mountain bikes (on even days) and makes for a dangerous hike.  Missed the turn off
20,2018-07-01,['hiking'],Great view at the top. Trail is very overgrown.
21,2018-06-13,[''],Fun trail with wonderful views at the end.
22,2018-01-04,[''],it's a path less taken. steep but very beautiful.
23,2017-07-13,[''],"The turnoff to the burch hollow trail (which forks off to the left from the pipeline trail) is easy to miss, so keep an eye on your map.  The trail is steep and overgrown, so I'd recommend long pants if you can handle the heat -- my legs got a bit scratched up.  But the views are tremendous."
24,2017-06-04,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! It's well marked, just keep following the signs to elbow/burch hollow. Second half is def. steep, e plowed during the middle of the day. View at the top is amazing and there are fun things to explore and wander around to on e you're up there!"
25,2017-04-20,[''],"Love this hike!  Just have to make sure you take the correct turns from the pipeline trail. 
Did it last night.  No snow left on the trail! 
Towards the end of the hike there is a stretch of some pretty steep switch backs, as you traverse up to the top of the hollow.  Beautiful views of gobblers  nob, and mt. Raymond behind you.  The trail also connects to the trail to hike to grandeur peek."
26,2017-04-08,['hiking'],"My pup and I love this trail. It has some steeper switchbacks early on but is really a pretty easy hike. We often do it as an after work, early evening hike. The view from the top is lovely. It's a great quick hike couple mile hike for people and pups."
27,2017-03-19,['hiking'],"The gps on AllTrails is a little off, you have to go a little further up the trail before you hit the switchback that takes you up. There's snow at the top which makes it a little slow going, but it's beautiful and at 65 degrees, it was perfect. Great views once you get further up. For sure moderate, not difficult."
28,2016-11-15,[''],"I agree this Burch Hollow part of the hike should not be considered easy or moderate. It was a steady, steep uphill climb. I measured we climbed 3.8 miles up and about 2000 feet of elevation gain! I loved to view at the top and was able to get back down the trail quickly. Some overgrowth and sticky burs that caught on my pants....highly recommend wearing pants!"
29,2016-09-26,['hiking'],Great hike- I would rate it easy until just over half way when you start really gaining some altitude. Once you're actually on Burch Hollow the path gets very narrow and over grown. We tripped quite a few times on roots and stumps that were covered with the fallen leaves. Having a good sense of balance really came in handy when crossing some of natures obstacles!
30,2016-09-11,[''],"Great secret, hiked on a saturday and we were the only people on the hike. Beautiful panoramic view. Hiked in early fall and colors were great. Trail was very overgrown in spots. Great steep hike with awesome views. I would definetly do it again."
31,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"7.25.2016  |  5:30-8:30PM Round Trip
Must Have: Long pants, hiking shoes, bug repellent.

I don't know why this trail is rated as moderate and reviewers say it's easy? Pipeline Trail is easy...Burch Hollow is HARD and doesn't look like it has been hiked in months.

Once you branch off from the Pipeline Trail it's steep and extremely overgrown. There are open lengths as well as lengths where the foliage was so dense I couldn't see my feet. Definitely wear long pants and hiking shoes as you're constantly pushing through thigh to waist deep plants (see pics for what my leggings looked like after).

We saw birds but most wildlife was skittering or crunching in the brush which spooked us a few times. Occasionally critters retreated to the side brush as we passed and I suspect it was snakes.

If you look at the map, we turned around shortly after reaching the long straight length. The foliage was SO thick I was nervous we wouldn't find our way back down. We also hiked this in the baking heat of a July evening and regardless of it being fairly shaded, should have taken a gallon of water for myself and a gallon for my GSD. 

Moral of the story: Watch your feet and prepare to bushwhack!"
32,2016-07-01,['hiking'],Favorite trail of all time! Last fall I took my dog up here every day. Nice for beginner trail running too. Have experienced a few inconsiderate & nasty bikers but generally everyone you run into is great
33,2016-06-24,['hiking'],"This was a nice, easy hike. Had some pretty views and wasn't too populated. I saw a baby rattlesnake on the trail, so keep an eye out."
34,2016-06-05,['hiking'],"Trail is initially a steep climb overlooking the road. It's exposed with shady patches. Take water & consider a shadier option at midday. On odd days dogs are off leash & there's not supposed to be bikes, though many bikers are confused. This is Upper Pipeline- a segment that IS NOT open to bikes all the time."
35,2016-05-23,['trail running'],Great trail for running! Lots of options to add on as well. Wildflowers are really coming out now. Pretty muddy with all the rain.
36,2016-05-17,[''],great trail and a quick getaway for a nice hike. dog friendly is a must so it makes this a great trail thats not to far from home.
37,2016-03-29,['hiking'],Most of this trail is a steady climb up to the ridge between Milcreek Canyon and Parleys Canyon. Still some snow on the trail but neither deep nor icy. View from the top is worth the hike. I was looking for a relatively short hike with a good elevation gain and this trail satisfied that wish
38,2015-11-12,['hiking'],Amazing views from the top
39,2015-01-25,['hiking'],Nice trek with great vistas that switchback n forth positioned halfway up the mountain. Very icy & muddy as I did this during the mid-winter thaw. Lots of traffic originating from the Church fork trailhead. Surprised it's a black diamond as it's pretty standard going unless you bushwhack your way up from the many campsite areas below as I did.
40,2014-07-22,['hiking'],"I am not sure how this is rated as difficult, at least for the first 2 miles.  I rate it as easy to moderate for the first mile which is all switchbacks off Mill Creek Canyon Road.  It is about a 450 feet elevation in the first mile but has several rather wide flat easy climbs. I have not hiked much in life  consider myself a beginner as we just moved from the midwest last year and have not hiked at all previously. This took me about an hour up and back (2 miles out and back). Great with dogs. On bike days be careful of bikers heading down off the trails above.  It is shaded in early am, a really nice hike in the heat of summer!"
41,2013-06-03,[''],Great for those looking into easy but rapid elevation gain.  This is a seldomly hiked trail that looks into Millcreek and Lambs Canyons.
