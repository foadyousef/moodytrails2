0,2019-08-27,['hiking'],"Four beautiful lake in only two miles of hiking, then two miles back. Trail is very rocky and uneven in places. Good hiking boots and hiking poles make it an easier hike. "
1,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"This is our second time doing this hike with our kids. This time we had a 13, 11, 9 and 9 month old with us. We didn't make it to Hooper lake. The sign at the trail head is wrong, but it's a beautiful hike. "
2,2019-08-14,[''],"Great hike, a lot less crowded than Mirror lake. Prepare for rain. "
3,2019-08-11,['hiking'],No Camping. 
4,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"Decided to try fishing at Fehr Lake (8/3/2019).  We had a few nibbles.  The hubby and our middle two kids stayed there to fish and play in the water while I took my 16 and 9 year old on to Shepard Lake.  What a gorgeous trail winding through wildflower meadows, forests, and down a quite rocky trail to reach this second lake!  Last time we tried this hike we thought the little pond maybe 10 minutes before Shepard Lake was it.  This time we knew better!  Super satisfying to actually see the real thing (silly us!).  We had to hustle back up the trail since we needed to start our drive back to SLC by 5pm...plus, rain clouds were rolling in.  Tip: Always be prepared for rain in the High Uintas!  We actually made the hike back up to the parking lot a lot more quickly than the hike down to Shepard Lake and we’re pulling out by 4:45pm.  Lightning and rain are a great motivator.  I do think the footing is definitely more moderate than easy for a good portion of the hike, but the setting is so beautiful and peaceful.  The wildflowers are stunning.  We love escaping the heat of the valley for a day trip up the Mirror Lake highway.  One of these days when we have more time, we’ll go on to Hoover Lake.  "
5,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky']","I’m a middle-aged novice hiker so take this for what it is, but this hike is NOT EASY. The hike to Fehr Lake is easy, but if you go further it’s a STEEP climb down a dry but rocky creek bed.  And Shepherd lake isn’t all that great anyway. We didn’t even make it to Hooper lake and it was four miles round trip, despite a sign saying Hooper Lake was only 1.5 miles. The bugs started being a problem around 1:00 pm. A beautiful setting but not what was advertised. "
6,2019-08-01,['hiking'],Nice hike.  
7,2019-07-29,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Really soggy in a few spots, but clear alternates.  It looks like your walking down a rocky creek a few times, don’t worry you are still on the trails. A lot of sweet dogs on the trail.  Saw bugs, bug weren’t interested in us.  Had spray just in case."
8,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky']",A really fun and gorgeous hike. A few parts are slightly steep and rocky but definitely nothing too difficult and it is still kid friendly. It’s marshy and muddy in a few parts. This is one of my favorite hikes and the lakes are beautiful. I highly recommend it. The mosquitos are the worst I’ve ever seen this year so DO NOT FORGET REPELLENT! 
9,2019-07-28,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']","We didn’t hike the whole thing, but beautiful wildflowers everywhere! No snow except small patches on the mountain above us. Definitely buggy, so don’t forget your bug spray and long sleeves. Small patches of mud, nothing too troublesome. I personally thought it was in perfect condition for hiking. "
10,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Unless you have snow shoes and are familiar with where this heads (there is no coverage up there at all for GPS), I’d give this trail several weeks or more.  Several feet of snow on the trail as of 6/29.  But having done it before, it’s awesome under the right conditions.  So much snow at Moosehorn across the street, so who knows when/if the campsite will open this season."
11,2019-06-29,['hiking'],"Keep going to Shepherd Lake. Fehr is a nice jaunt, but Shepherd helps you feel accomplished and it’s really pretty back there with a shallow shelf to wade in. "
12,2018-10-29,['hiking'],Great hike even with the snow. The lakes are beautiful.
13,2018-09-19,['hiking'],"A great hike for a relaxing day trip to the Uintas. Beautiful is par for the course in these mountains, so be ready to enjoy some world-class scenery. The trail is relatively short, but it does descend pretty rapidly in places and is definitely rocky, so if you're new to hiking or bringing kids along be careful on the way down and budget extra time for the hike back up. Expect to see other people and even some paddle boards or watercraft on the lakes."
14,2018-09-18,[''],"Gorgeous views all along the hike. The path was very clear and easy to follow.  Some of the path was smooth and flat, parts of walking on a wooden path and parts of climbing up and down on rocks. Area is clean without trash or debris and was not heavily trafficked with people. Lots of great spots to place a tent if you were backpacking"
15,2018-08-28,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike with good destination lakes. Very doable with younger family. We crossed paths with a moose during a rain storm and made for some exciting memories. Lots of wildflowers, awesome alpine lakes, and variation of meadows and forested areas on well marked trail."
16,2018-08-15,['fishing'],Quick easy hike. Caught and released a few Brook trout at Hoover lake.
17,2018-08-06,['backpacking'],"This was a great hike for our dog and an ‘Out of Shape’ backpacker (me). We hiked to Fehr, Shepard, and Hoover lakes. We spent time playing around at Hoover and Shepard lakes then hiked back to Fehr lake to camp overnight. Fantastic weekend trip including one of the best lightning storms we had seen in a long time. Fun times!"
18,2018-08-02,['hiking'],"We hiked to Fehr Lake and then to Shepard Lake...or what we thought was Shepard Lake but must have just been a pond now that we have WiFi and cell and can look at the map. LOL!  With one of my kids having some stomach troubles, that was really as much as we were able to do anyway.  Gorgeous trail with beautiful lakes, views, and wildflowers.  We’ll definitely need to go back and to the whole thing when everyone is feeling well!"
19,2018-07-31,['hiking'],4 Miles out and back to Hoover lake
20,2018-07-30,[''],This trail is awesome. Four large lakes to see and the first one is less than a mile in. Great for kids and dogs and overnights.
21,2018-07-14,['hiking'],Great day for a hike.   Easy trail. We went into Shepherd and Hoover lakes.   Pretty lakes with great views of bald mountain.  The wild flowers were spectacular
22,2018-06-30,[''],Great small hike in the high Uintas. Did it with a 3 and 5 yr old with no issues. Limited hike to Fehr lake by doing a complete loop around the lake and having a picnic on the large rocks on the southeast corner. Fantastic area to explore. Don’t miss the Provo falls overlook if you are coming from Kamas as it’s a highlight of the mirror lake scenic highway. Btw it was 85 in SLC and 54 at fehr lake so dress accordingly.
23,2018-06-24,['hiking'],"Weather - High 60's and mostly sunny. Last vestiges of remaining snow on the peaks. Dry, well maintained trail, with boardwalks in a few marsh/meadow areas. Wildflowers blooming everywhere this time of year. This place is gorgeous and idyllic with awesome photo opportunities. Dog friendly. A great place to let your companion swim around and have a good time. This looks to be a moderately popular spot. It's high elevation and out of the way, so it's never going to be packed. Several other hikers had the same idea we did, but it didn't feel busy. If you're into backpacking, there are a few improvised sites just off the trail. It's worth considering an overnight trip. If you're physically fit, this hike is going to a very enjoyable walk. If you're not fit (I'm not), it's still perfectly doable and highly enjoyable. Elevation change is only a couple hundred feet over a half mile. It's downhill on the way in. So be advised that you have a small climb on the way out. 

Note:  
Elevation is about 11,000 feet/3350 meters. You will notice the rarefied air. Not a big deal. Just be aware that 02 levels are about half of sea level. Just take your time if you're not used to it.

Five Stars. Put this one on your list!"
24,2018-06-13,['hiking'],Hiked this trail today. Very easy and very beautiful! Still a little snow so trail was muddy in certain spots but worth it!
25,2017-10-03,[''],"We did this hike in May and the landscape was carpeted with wild flowers.  We continued on to Shepard and Hoover Lakes, taking pictures all along the way.  Bring mosquito repellant and your camera.  Easy hike for any skill level."
26,2017-08-28,['backpacking'],"My dad, my 14 year old sister, and myself went backpacking here last week. Beautiful and very easy hike into the Lake. There are plenty of places to set up camp here, with firepits from previous backpackers and plenty of firewood all around. Would recommend bringing an ax if you will be having a fire. There is also a little spring running into the lake with fresh water, but I recommend either using a filter or boil the water to make sure it's clean. From the parking lot to Fehr Lake, it's just over a half mile. Very easy for little ones as well. If you keep following the trail, it will take you to the other 3 lakes. We only went to the first one, which was about another 2 - 2.5 miles to get to, which was shepherd lake. Gorgeous mirror like water with a waterfall on the other side. We only made it to this lake before heading back to Fehr Lake. We tried fishing at both lakes with no luck, but neither of us are big fishers which could explain our bad luck. Overall this is the perfect place to go backpacking if you are a beginner or have little ones. We were the only ones camping here, but there were plenty of hikers coming through during the day. But we camped on the south west side of the lake, which is the opposite side of the trail, so we were not disturbed. We will definitely be returning here next year!"
27,2017-08-14,['hiking'],Great for kids and families. Absolutely beautiful scenery. We threw in some fishing with power bait and never got a bight in about 2 hours. This may have been because we were fishing the middle of the day though.
28,2017-08-06,['hiking'],"Easy, well maintained trail to three named lakes, plus smaller unnamed lakes. The hike really only gets started at Fehr Lake but goes beyond to Sheppard and Hoover Lakes. For me, an added bonus is Moosehorn Lake, just across the road from the trailhead."
29,2017-07-23,['mountain biking'],"Unless you're an expert mountain biker, would not recommend this trail for biking.  We took a group of 24 youth/adults on this trail with bikes and there are many unnegotiable rocky patches that require dismounting.  At the end of the trail, we climbed the ridge to the Murdock Basin Road and took that all the way to the Mirror Lake Highway for a total 5-hour trip.  The upper section of the MBR has many fallen trees across the road."
30,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"Great trail, easy along the beautiful scenic lakes. Dog friendly. I've never seen more than a few people on the trail.  Stop and stay for a while, but this time of year have your bug spray handy."
31,2017-07-08,['hiking'],"Hit Fehr, Shepherd and Hoover lakes. Then looped around Shepherd lake to see the waterfall on the other side. The trails are pretty muddy in some places, and there's a couple trees down on the trail, but nothing too crazy. Definitely recommend taking bug spray!"
32,2017-07-01,['hiking'],Awesome day hike. Did this on 6/28/17. A few little patches of snow but overall clear. Pretty muddy on some parts of the trail though. Mosquitos were pretty bad as well. But I would def do this hike again. Made it to Shepard and Hoover lakes as well and explored around a bit. There was nobody else on the trail the whole time we were there.
33,2016-08-07,['hiking'],"Great hike!  It was all downhill to get to the lakes, so it was all uphill to get out, but it was not bad.  The third lake, Hoover Lake, was the best one.  We got to watch an osprey fishing.  Other than some noisy people, it was a great day."
34,2016-07-29,[''],Gorgeous hike. Right now the wildflowers are in full bloom. To get the first lake is .5 miles. The trail does have several decent climbs.
35,2016-07-24,['hiking'],"Loved this hike. Perfect lakes to let the dogs swim. Careful of the bugs as they are bad right now! For a full write up and guide to this trail check out my blog: http://www.mylifestyletoyours.com/07/2016/guide-to-fehr-lake-trail/

36,2016-02-11,['hiking'],"Great hike. I highly recommend you keep going to Marshall, Hoover, and Shepherd lakes. Was a little crowded when I went in late August, but once you get past Fehr lake and weed out the weak ones, it opens right up. Dogs loved it."
37,2015-11-15,['fishing'],"Great little hike, easy enough for kids.  Great fly-fishing for some beautiful brookies.  This is a great hike to get away from the road but still be close enough if you need anything."
38,2015-10-19,['hiking'],Nice little lake for short hike
39,2015-08-12,[''],"fun easy hike, also recommend going to shepherd, marshell, and maba lakes about a mile farther."
40,2015-07-30,['hiking'],Great trail if you go to the other two lakes after you reach the first lake. Makes the hike longer and easy to have three destinations. Great for my dog he loved the lakes. Looks like a good spot to camp around the third lake as well. Easy going down harder coming back up.
41,2015-06-18,['hiking'],"This is an easy, super family-friendly trail in the Uinta Mountains. If you're looking for a more even trail with little change in elevation, this is a good hike. The trail is well established and if you go at the end of July through mid-August, you'll likely see some beautiful wildflowers along the trail. "
42,2014-09-05,['hiking'],"Enjoyed this hike. Was up on a Wednesday and there were only 2 other cars at the trailhead. It is a short hike to the first lake and is relatively easy. After stopping to fish for about 45 minutes, I continued on to Shepard Lake. The leg down to Shepard is a bit more difficult with much more elevation lost, but is well worth it."
43,2014-08-18,['hiking'],"Hiked with our two small children - beautiful morning hike, saw a few others on the trail but not very busy. No one at the lake when we arrived. We just missed the height of wildflower season but I imagine it would be spectacular in July. We continued to Shepard and Hoover lakes."
44,2013-11-22,['hiking'],"This hike if for the hiker who doesn't want to hike far at all, but still feel like they are in the middle of nowhere with a lake all to themselves. Me and my buddy hiked this in June 2013 (still had some high level snow in some spots) took is about 15 minutes from the car to the lake. Toddlers can hike this with ease. Fishing was good for us the day we went. Caught 4 brook trout in about an hour. If you go during the week theres a good chance you'll have the lake all to yourselves."
45,2013-07-21,['hiking'],"Hiked this today with my wife, daughter and her husband and two grand children ages 1 1/2 and 4 . The trail was easy enough that the 4 year old hiked the entire trail by herself. The hike took us less than a hour to complete. We only stopped at the lake for around 10 minutes"
46,2011-12-24,['hiking'],"My family camps at Mirror Lake every year.  This was the first hike we did that week.  Even our 3-year-old joined us.  We continued on to Shepard Lake where there is a beautiful small waterfall on the west side.  After a rest and some snacks, my wife headed back with our 3-year-old and our 7-year-old.  I continued on with my 15- and 17-year old kids to Marshall Lake and then back past Hoover Lake toward Mirror Lake.  We bushwhacked back to camp.  I'd definitely do this hike again (except for the bushwacking part)."
