1,2019-07-06,"['hiking', 'no shade']","Enjoyed hiking on an overcast day.  The views were
fantastic!  It was steep at some points, but was worth it.  I would avoid hiking here on very hot days.  "

3,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'over grown']","Great trail until the last quarter mile, scrub battle ensued and I lost, never made it to the top, also I would consider this hard not moderate, wear long pants my legs look like a cats scratching post!!!
Great views though, it’s one and done for me."
4,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'over grown']","Harder than I thought it would be, but solitude and fantastic views all around!  No snow"

6,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","We hiked this trail after a week of rain so it was pretty muddy, but the muddy parts were mostly flat. The views were absolutely beautiful the whole way. There was quite a bit of snow the last half mile or so to the top. We didn’t have spikes with us so we just had to take it slow. Definitely worth it once you get to the top. My watch estimated 5.6 miles but that could be from the snow covering the main trail. With the snow it was a little more challenging but overall a really enjoyable, beautiful hike. "
7,2019-04-29,"['hiking', 'snow']",Hiked on 4/19 and the trail was covered in deep snow about of mile or so in. Knee deep in some places. Beautiful views of SLC out to the Great Salt Lake. Some steep inclines. Saw a moose and tons of deer and moose scat. Little foliage and few flowers at that point.
8,2018-09-18,['hiking'],"Poorly maintained trail.  There were several times I had to reconnoiter to determine where the trail was.  Most of the latter part of the trail is overgrown with thick shrubs, small trees, and bushes.  Be prepared to fight your way through this.  Long pants and a long sleeve shirt are a must.  This is also more of a ball-buster of a trail than you might think from it being on a ridgeline.  There are several steep and long climbs.  After about two hours of fighting the jungle of undergrowth I gave up and turned around and went back.  There are some nice views of the valley to the west, but overall this trail isn't worth it."
9,2018-07-28,[''],"I was expecting more of a long ridge trail run, this is much more of a hiking trail.  mostly steep ups and downs with few flat sections.  as others have noted, the trail is poorly maintained after mile 2 (before the steep climb to the first peak). Pants would be advised."
10,2018-06-23,['hiking'],"Views from the trail are great but the last mile or so of the trail is completely unmaintained at this point. Bush whacking at it's best. A machete or gas powered weed whacker is recommended. The app states 8 miles but our fitness watches recorded closer to 12. Overall a great hike, just more strenuous due to the last part of the trail."
11,2018-06-12,['hiking'],"Amazing views. Not very well maintained about halfway through, though. But a lot of fun. I will say, that it’s on the highest end of a ‘moderate’ rating. Some pretty tough sections."
12,2018-05-29,[''],Bring plenty of water and snacks a light jacket if you start late even in full summer time
13,2018-05-14,['trail running'],"Wear long pants!!!  In the middle portion, the trail is narrow and there are tons of sharp bush branches that stick out across the trail, impossible to avoid, and some of them are sharp enough to draw blood. I got plenty scratched up.... Other than that it was awesome"
14,2018-05-14,['trail running'],"Grew up in salt lake and haven't done this trail until this week.  Good experience, really gradual except the middle and the end.  The trail isn't maintained near the end which is a little bit of a pain.  Excellent views the entire way."
15,2018-02-03,['hiking'],"Immediate ascent, but otherwise pretty moderate. Did the hike in January, so still some snow pack. Actually prevented me from finishing the last mile of the hike. 

Views are amazing.  Definitely recommend this one."
16,2018-01-19,['hiking'],"This was a challenging hike for a chunky, out of shape, lady like myself, but a good challenge. Muddy as all get out in some parts, but the ascent was enjoyable and rewarding."
17,2017-11-26,['hiking'],"Hiked this yesterday and it was lovely. With this warm weather in November, the trail is dry with the exception of the top, shadow section of the mountain. It’s a little muddy but not bad at all. *There were a lot of bow hunters*"
18,2017-09-05,['hiking'],"Several comments about poorly maintained trail are accurate, but much farther along than half way. I would say 3/4 or more of the way the trail is fine. I took my family on this hike thinking it would be a gradual climb up to Perkins Peak since the elevation gain over 4 miles is listed at 2500 feet. Gradual is no where to be found on this trail. It is many fairly steep vertical climbs and descents repeated over and over. Several of the family turned back at 2 miles and the rest that didn't go all the way turned back at 2.5 miles in. If you just hike to the 1st summit (about 2.6 miles from the trail head) it's actually a fairly pleasant hike and decent view of downtown SLC from there. Hiking all the way to Perkins Peak is difficult as you'll descend and ascend multiple peaks (I believe 6) before you even reach Perkins Peak at the end. There are not any good decipherable trails to the top. Wearing long pants is a must as you'll be scrambling through thick scrub oak. Hiking back was difficult as there were still several ascents to get back to the trail head. I would have preferred a hike like Grandeur Peak or Mount Wire Big Beacon better with just ascending to the summit, and only descending back down the mountain. The constant up and down was not my preferred style of hiking."
19,2017-08-12,['hiking'],"Second half of trail is very poorly maintained. Trail turned from road to decent trail to deer path to thick brush to nonexistent and impassable. Neat views of Salt Lake City and Emigration Canyon, but my ambitious group could not find a way to the final peak that would not have required a machete."
20,2017-07-13,['trail running'],Uncrowded - didn't see a single person during my run. Fun climbs/descents with a couple pretty steep sections.
21,2017-05-28,['hiking'],It's a moderate trail with one or two slick sections as one gets to the steeper parts.  I did not go all the way to the city view.
22,2017-05-16,[''],Only hiked half of it and turned around. Glad I did because it started hailing/snowing right after. Then the sun came back out. Nice trail though! Lots of sunflowers and gorgeous views. The hike is pretty steep on parts of the section. You can see the city and the Salt Lake on a section of it. I will definitely go back in the summer and hike all of it!
23,2017-01-07,['snowshoeing'],Showshoed to the peak about 2.6 miles into this trail. The last 3/4-1 mile breaking trail. Lots of wildlife tracks in the snow and a couple of beds where a Moose spent some time. Great view of the Southern and Northern Salt Lake Vaiiey
24,2016-12-05,[''],Great for snowshoeing!
25,2016-09-05,['trail running'],"I usually love a good ridgeline, but somehow this one didn't speak to me.  The lower section I guess is easy, but once you start to climb up above the marked ""start"" point of this hike (even though having it be the start point makes no sense) it's moderate, and the trail quickly fades (or at least that was what I found in 2015).  It does have nice views down both sides, but is a low enough ridge that the views aren't really expansive, and there is no shade.  I guess I'm just spoiled ;-)"
26,2016-07-02,[''],"There are some nice views, but very little shade. Good early spring hike."
27,2016-06-27,[''],"I absolutely love the north east side of this trail. the hiking was easy going and there was a great variety of flowers, trees and wild life. the views are amazing. I can't wait for the leaves to start changing, I will definitely be up there again. 
the south side of the trail was fine enough but most of it looked the same and there's almost no shade. its pretty hot. 
I love this area and I can't wait to do more of the nearby hikes."
28,2016-06-18,['hiking'],"Great hike, I love the options here, seems like endless country lies before.  The views are amazing and you start at a high elevation, so there isn't really too much climbing involved.  Beautiful!"
29,2016-05-31,['hiking'],"Great hike on a sunny 70 degree day. Lots of sunflowers, balsam arrowroot, mule ears, larkspur; beginning wall flowers, bluebells, paintbrush at higher elevation. There is a trail intersection at approx. 3.4 m with no markings and 4 groups of hikers came through and wondered what trail went where. Very confusing. I continued upwards to what likely was the ""look out"" I'd heard about. This was a group of craggy rocks you can sit on and dangle your feet in the air. Trail continued, but I saw no need to go further. The view from this Look Out was breathtaking. With info from other sources, I think round-trip was 10+ mi."
30,2016-05-31,['hiking'],"Great Beginner Trail; nothing technical; however as many have mentioned it can get very steep and up and downs will tire you out if you're new.

There is ample parking at the trail head; you'll know you're there as there appears to be a pumping station and there is also bathrooms. Seems to be a stopping point for a lot of bikers and motorcyclists.

For the first ~1.5 miles of the trail definitely seems like it was some type of service/fire road as its two track; a little further it narrows a bit; but the trail is very easy to follow.

About 2.5 miles in you'll get your first view of SLC; which is where we ended up turning around as we had several people who had never been on a hike before and were tired.

Great views of Emigration Canyon and also I-80; if you headed further up looks like you could get even better SLC views.

Headed out on Memorial Day; and was lightly trafficked (saw maybe 3 other groups total; 7 others?) cell service was present the whole time if your concern is safety."
31,2016-04-13,[''],Great hike! Amazing views will do again!
32,2016-04-09,[''],Good to run. Trail seems to be an old service route for a gas line or cell towers.
33,2016-02-13,['hiking'],"Some fairly steep sections but generally fairly easy going. If there is snow, it gets less compacted and therefore harder to walk on the further from the trailhead you go. Snowshoes would be a bonus, especially on a warm day. Nice views of the valley (well, today of the inversion) but nice to get out of the smog!"
34,2015-10-08,['hiking'],NO DOGS ALLOWED! Everything online says otherwise but there are signs posted at the trailhead showing no dogs allowed. Trail overall rates pretty easy with some moderate and steeper climbs as well as some tricky descents when the rock is wet. Beautiful hike that doesn't take too long as long as you're used to hiking.
35,2015-09-13,['trail running'],Gorgeous! It isn't too strenuous and offers stunning views of Emigration and Parleys Canyons. It was perfect for train running and wasn't crowded at all.
36,2015-04-29,['hiking'],"This was a great trail on a beautiful day. As has been said before, the elevation is deceptive because of all of the up and down. There is zero shade, so if it is a sunny day, you are in it the entire way. The wildflowers are coming out right now which was very nice. When you get out to the point where the valley comes into sight, it is a great view. I would do this trail again."
37,2015-01-18,['hiking'],"Nice winter hike as the elevation is not too high and the snow is not too deep. No shade and windy. Gorgeous views. The trail is not your typical mountain hike, it takes you up, then down, and repeats that a few times over throughout. No need for snowshoes. The path is packed down. Microspikes are nice to have for the downhills as they can get a little steep and slippery. But you can still be ok in hiking boots if you're careful."
38,2014-12-07,['hiking'],All alone on this one...it is a nice hike with a few great views.  Fairly easy.  Lots of wildlife signs but no sightings.  Would do this again if looking for a quick hike.
39,2013-09-23,['hiking'],"Fun hike with some nice views, but deceptively hard. Total elevation gain is not much but you're going up and down over the ridgeline, so in the end the elevation gain is 2-3x the total. Ran into a wild turkey on the trail that scared the s**t out of me."
40,2013-05-31,['hiking'],Great little hike with very little traffic. I went on Memorial Day and only saw two other people the whole time I was there. The hike takes along the ridgeline between Emigration Canyon and Parley's Canyon. Towards the end you get some great views of the Salt Lake Valley and at the end there is a nice little clearing to sit and enjoy the view or have lunch.
