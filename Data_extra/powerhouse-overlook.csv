Picturesque views of the valley and the mountains make this a “stop-and-admire” type hike. On the other hand, the trail to the summit (from the outlook) is largely overgrown. My wife and I tapped out after about a quarter mile because we were wearing shorts. Longer pants are a must if you want to take the extra half-mile or so to the summit."

the view is beautiful but I didnt enjoy the hike."
2,2019-08-15,['hiking'],"Great hike, we went early in the morning and had shade almost the whole time. Came up Spring Canyon and then continued on to the overlook. Very rocky, so trekking poles made the going much easier. There are wild raspberries (thimbleberries) among a large section of the trail and amazing views up hobble creek canyon and out across the valley. We saw a red-tailed hawk and some ruffed grouse along the way. Well worth the hike, and there are some great camping spots (flat meadows) near the top. We didn’t find any water sources so bring plenty. Our hike was about 8.7 miles up and back."

4,2019-07-29,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Driving up to the trailhead is a little rough but once you get to it the trail is direct and easy to follow. It is very rocky but very doable. It’s semi steep yet easy enough. We went with our 4 boys ages 10, 8, 5, and 8 months and they all made it to the top and back with no major complaints. I do recommend shoes with good traction as the rocky parts can get slippery on the way down. The view at the top is beautiful. "
5,2019-07-25,['hiking'],7/24/19. Great hike! First mile was rocky but not too bad. We hike past the lookout to the peak. After the lookout there was a little overgrown path that lead to the peak but you are walking through a lot of bushes and trees. Beautiful views and pretty shaded along the way up. Took us about 3 hours and was 4.8 miles to the peak (slow hiking after overlook due to bush and small trail)
6,2019-07-19,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Fun short hike with great views at the top!  Mostly on a ATV trail. Quite rocky. Looks down on Hobble Creek Golf Course. Mostly shaded. Enjoy!!
7,2019-07-15,['hiking'],I went with my adventure group Get Out There Girl last weekend. This was a steep rocky hike and the views were spectacular. 360 degrees of gorgeous views. I could have spent hours up at the peak. It was beautiful and I highly recommend this hike. 
8,2019-06-23,['hiking'],"Beautiful summer evening hike. we started late (8:23pm) the beginning was very rocky from ATVs loosening large rocks. some of the turns had steep banks which forced you to walk across the rocks for the first 0.6 miles up. It makes for a more difficult ""moderate"" hike. the sides of the trail this time of year are lush and green. Thick, dense and beautiful. However, after you get past that, the trail goes flat for the reminder of the first mile until you reach a beautiful large meadow. we saw a few Elk, before they ran up into the thick pines, then we noticed a bull moose about 60 yards away watching us without a care in the world. because it was getting dark, we turned around and headed back down, slipping a few times on the loose rocks. But the beauty of nature and wildlife was worth the 5-star rating tonight."

Like people said before, the beginning is really steep (had to stop two times to catch my breath because of the elevation). The view at the top is 360°! Very pretty. There’s also a pretty meadow about halfway through the hike. "
10,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'rocky']","This trail has an amazing view for its’ length. We reached the trailhead in a Corolla, however I would not recommend it and recommend taking a vehicle that is more equipped for off-roading. The beginning of the trail is full of loose rocks and is a little scary at times however it is very doable if you are careful. We only encountered one other group of hikers. Amazing view at top! "
11,2019-06-15,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Fun trail with some great views of the valley. Starts out steeper than I expected.
12,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Took my 10 year old niece and she did fine. There’s a decent incline at least half the way up. We stopped several times on the way for water breaks, snacks, and appreciating the lovely views. We saw a few lizards, a wild turkey, lovely wildflowers, and some gorgeous bright little orange/black/white birdies.The panoramic view at the top is so lovely and very worth it!"
13,2018-08-28,['hiking'],"Nice short hike with great view. Takes a bit to get up the bumpy road to the trailhead.

When you get to the parking lot, the trail is in the far right (SW) corner."
14,2018-08-18,['hiking'],"The views at the top were gorgeous. Worth the hike. Personally, a short distance for the views you get, though the trail is ATV trail also so very rocky and rough in certain spots."
15,2018-07-21,['hiking'],"Did this during the end of July around 10:30 AM.  Took us 2 hours with 2 dogs and many water breaks.  It was warm, probably 85+, but we brought plenty of water.  ATV trail to the overlook and then a short trail to the summit.  We encountered 1 group of three and 1 razor.  Like everyone said, loose rock, dusty dirt, lizards, berries, aspens, moderate amounts of shade, 1 pretty meadow."
16,2018-06-30,['hiking'],"Absolutely gorgeous views, quite a hike up hill to get there!"
17,2018-06-09,['hiking'],Uphill and rocky. Had a baby in a pack and that made my center of gravity off. Didn’t make it to the end because of short time. Didn’t plan for non-paved and narrowing road to trailhead. Good lookout about 1/2 way up. Pretty foliage and many blooming flowers. Lots of bees doing there work.
18,2018-05-28,[''],"a little steep, but a beautiful trail. the elevation gain is worth the view from the top. there looks to be a trail the goes a little further. we followed it for a bit, but the brush gets a little thick and we didn't want to kill or damage anything. it's beautiful and green. definitely a hike I'd recommend. 

bring some water! there are quite a few stretches in direct sun!"
19,2017-06-21,['hiking'],"Quite steep the whole way up and on some loose rocks. Gorgeous view of the valley tho, and a fair amount of shade. The perfect summer escape hike. Getting up the Squaw Peak road wasn't all that hard and I could have done it in a passenger car probably. Lots of cool little lizards. We continued on past the overlook to do the Powerhouse summit, required a bit of brush beating through a faint trail along the ridgeline but we made it!"
