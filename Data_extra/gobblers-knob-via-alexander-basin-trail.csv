0,2019-09-08,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky']","The entire trail boasts some of the best views ever! There were so many meadows and Aspen groves. As long as you bring plenty of water & snacks for you & your pup and take a safe pace up & down, you’ll have the best day ever! "
1,2019-08-31,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
2,2019-08-31,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","if you want to hold hands, don't go on this trail! Great stair stepper the whole time.  "
3,2019-08-28,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
4,2019-08-25,['hiking'],So steep. Legs are jelly. Ridiculously steep. Worth it? Absolutely. Views are insane. Meadow and wildflowers on steroids. I clocked 5.5 miles to the knob.
5,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"Get ready for steep! From the Mill Creek side it’s 3,000 feet of elevation climb in just over 2 miles. That equates to some heavy breathing from your inexperienced, out of shape, “hiking” buddies. Feel the burn because you will.  The hike is beautiful the entire way up. Lots to look at and plenty of shade for a majority of the hike. Definitely worth summiting. Don’t stop at the saddle. The rest of the hike takes all but 10 minutes or less from there. If stair master is your thing, I’d 10/10 recommend. "
6,2019-08-23,"['hiking', 'over grown']",Short and steep but really beautiful at the top! I started around 9 am and only saw 3 hikers on my way up. It started to get busier as I came down (so closer to 11 am). There’s no stream along the trail so bring plenty of water for your pup! The trail gets confusing in the last mile to half-mile. Stay left at the large boulder field and then stay right and head toward the rocky ridge line (the summit). 
7,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"Not busy if you start around 8am on a Sunday. The traffic seemed to pick up on our way down around 11am. Still a few flowers left here and there -- also, toadstools, pika, and a couple of moose. This hike is steep as advertised but not sketchy in nice summer conditions. The path is occasionally a little overgrown but otherwise well-trodden. While there is intermittent shade and the first mile is forested, the trail gets pretty hot toward the bottom later in the morning. If you're partial to greenery and 360-degree views, these are some of the best in the Wasatch."
8,2019-08-10,['hiking'],Trail is actually 5.2 miles out and back not 4. Excellent hike. Gorgeous meadows and the view from the top is spectacular.
9,2019-08-08,"['hiking', 'scramble']","Excellent hike, well shaded. Towards the end there is scrambling a little climbing
"
10,2019-07-31,['hiking'],Short and steep with no snow to the summit. 1hr45 car2car on a cool overcast morning. 
11,2019-07-30,['hiking'],"Great day with tons of elevation.  No snow, no crampons needed.  Pack water, you’ll need it if starting after 9am.  Hardly any people (7), was just a bonus.  Lots of loose rocks, so trek poles helpful if ankle intrinsic muscles aren’t super strong.  Worth the views up/down big cottonwood canyon !!"
12,2019-07-16,['hiking'],"Spikes are necessary, for several portions of the actual trail. (There’s a few snow patches left, see my pics.) And at least one pole, since it’s quite slippery with the steepness coupled with rocks, pine cones, etc., that have collected. 

Also, please clean up after your dogs and humans. (I gathered two bags of poo and other trash that people left.) Thank you to all the nice people on the trail, it’s so appreciated when others show they know that uphill hikers have the right of way! "
13,2019-07-12,['hiking'],"Spikes are not necessary as of today, since it has been so warm and the snow is melting rapidly. The trail was easy to lose and I ended up freestylin' up the rock field which I would not recommend. The way down was much easier since I could see the trail clearly. There was a ton of ladybugs hatching at the summit, so cool! This is not for an inexperienced hiker. It starts out fairly steep and becomes much trickier with loose rock and dirt. "
14,2019-07-10,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']","Probably the toughest 2 miles up you’ll ever do, but definitely worth it. Lots of loose rock and some slick snow patches closer to the summit, so bringing spikes may still be a good idea (it’s July as I’m writing this review). Park in the lot that says Alexander Basin trail and follow it up—on AllTrails the start of the trail is straight up from the road up an embankment which isn’t correct."
15,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"I hiked to the top via the Bowman Fork trail. I wanted to descend through Alexander Basin but had a hard time finding the trail. First I went one way, realized that was wrong, backtracked to the top. Then went another way, was on a trail.... but then realized it wasn't the Alexander Basin trail. Ended up descending about 1000 feet through steep snow fields (somewhat harrowing) before I could join the trail (and therefore didn't experience the steep trail/scree other people have written about, although that sounds like it would have been better than what I did!). After that it was fine, but I thought Bowman Fork was the nicer trail and will probably choose that when I want to go back to Gobblers Knob. Went back via White Fir Pass to Bowman Fork since my car was parked at the bottom of Bowman Fork."
16,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"Found iPhone on the snow near the top, locked with 6 digit code, left at entrance station. "
17,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"Ok I knew this was going to be steep, but holy you know what, I didnt think it would be that steep.  the scramble to the saddle on loose scree was crazy. coming down would have been a nightmare but I was able to use the snow fields and slide down.  the view from the top was amazing.  I had poles which was a huge help.  Not for the faint of heart or inexperienced.  "
18,2018-11-22,[''],Great trail!
19,2018-10-09,[''],Great hike! Not for those wanting an easy walk. The scenery changes as the summer progresses. I have Verizon as my cell carrier and get service right before hitting the saddle of the basin. Love that because I can share pictures at that moment. I wear microspikes and take hiking sticks every time.
20,2018-09-24,['hiking'],One of the best hikes in all of the wasatch! Certainly challenging but worth every second of it!
21,2018-09-05,[''],Up to the trail split is very steep and loose. Not fun
22,2018-09-03,['hiking'],This is a challenging trail with a steep climb. My poor knees were not happy but it’s definitely worth a try.
23,2018-09-01,['hiking'],"For me and my friends, this hike was the complete opposite of pure misery, but instead pure joy! Very scenic route up to the top, and WOW, what a great view at the very top. Yes you might feel a little tired going up if you aren't in shape, but that's just a given. Would do this hike again any day."
24,2018-09-01,['hiking'],"I hiked this today with the dog. She took it like a champ, but after hitting the saddle was pretty beat, so we turned around. 

It’s definitely steep (60% grade near the top) and a bit loose underfoot. I wished I’d brought my poles to save my knees a bit on the way down. 

There’s no water I found on the way up, so bring plenty for your four-legged friends. 

It took us about 1.5 hours to get up to the saddle, and about an hour to get back down to the car. 

The views up on the saddle are fantastic, temps are still nice, and I had no insects pestering me. Overall, a jolly stroll."
25,2018-08-16,[''],amazing views! very steep and will kick your butt! the only thing that would make it better is a nice creek.
26,2018-08-11,['hiking'],"I’d truly say 3.5 but not an option. Once the trail gets technical (trail vs rock slide) there are no cairns! I figured it out after looking at the trail for a few minutes but contemplated just scaling the mountainside like an idiot biker. 

I was at 2.8 miles by the time I got to the top, when I hit 2 miles I hadn’t wandered off trail so the 4 mile out-back range is wrong. I did hit up Raymond so I can’t give an accurate mileage report for you. 

The bees, gnats, flies, and ladybugs (they were biting too) were outta control up top but still worth the scramble."
27,2018-08-08,['hiking'],Short but sweet! Great views! Still need to tackle Raymond! … :-)
28,2018-08-08,['hiking'],"I don’t mean to be a kill joy, but this was pure misery coming back down. I’m all for a challenge climbing up a steep incline, but I fell 3 or 4 times on the way down because of the rocks constantly sliding under foot. It took hours of inching myself down and I was very very done by the time I got back. Am I doing something wrong? I am wearing hiking shoes. Sorry to be a crybaby, but just a warning if that doesn’t sound fun to you. The views ARE magnificent. It’s just hard to enjoy the hike when your eyes are glued to your feet the whole time."
29,2018-07-30,['hiking'],Early 30’s; home regularly and this one kicked my butt. VERY steep. Beautiful the whole time and very rewarding.
30,2018-07-22,['hiking'],Dogs are allowed on odd numbered days
31,2018-07-22,['hiking'],"Hiked this today and this hike was definitely a challenge... it didn’t waste anytime making you climb 3,000 feet. Once you get out of the dense canopy/trees, you have awesome views of the mountains down below. Once you get to the basin, there’s a ton of pretty wildflowers. The view from the top made it well worth it-360 view of everything down below. Would recommend for average-above average hikers. "
32,2018-07-22,['hiking'],"Omg, this trail was very challenging in places and incredibly beautiful!  Lots of wild flowers and cute little bees pollinating. Plenty of shade in certain areas, and once you make it to the top, the view was epic!  I will definitely be doing this one again.  Make sure to bring lots of water.  We weren’t planning to do such an intense hike today and so didn’t plan appropriately and ran out of water at the top.  Had to make it all the way back down with no water . Thank god for the shade! Very steep in places, but so rewarding!"
33,2018-07-16,['hiking'],Very steep. Great views the whole hike and amazing wildflowers.
34,2018-07-05,['hiking'],Excellent! Beautiful!!
35,2018-07-05,['hiking'],Steep! Worth it.
36,2018-07-04,['hiking'],butt kicker
37,2018-07-03,['hiking'],"Went on this hike yesterday and it was AWESOME !
Its steep and it gets steeper till the end but you get to see some amazing views. You also get to witness the beauty of the big cottonwood canyon on your left when you are close to the summit. 
Was a challenge but worth it ! ⛰"
38,2018-07-03,[''],"Great hike, enjoyed the views all around."
39,2018-07-03,['hiking'],Grasses and flowers higher than your knees. The first part and the last part are steep. Nice work out.
40,2018-06-11,[''],Gate closed till 01Jul
41,2018-04-21,[''],The gate is closed to part of the canyon so you have an extra 3 mile walk up a snowy road to get to the trailhead. there are still several feet of snow on the trail itself so I highly recommend snowshoes.
42,2018-03-11,['hiking'],Had my first encounter with a black bear on this trail!
43,2017-10-26,['hiking'],"Lovely hike as always.  The gate is now closed, so I biked up the 3 miles to the trailhead.  The trail was pretty clear up to the steeper climbs through the meadows, then icy but manageable.  I was out of time and so turned around before the final climb - it was snowcovered and probably would have been difficult with the ice."
44,2017-10-13,['hiking'],Hiked this morning and couldn't quite summit due to dangerous ice on the last part of the trail.  If I had some trekkers I would have done it.  Came across a moose!  I would love to go back in the summer.  It's a little late in the year for this one as it is in the shade most of the morning.  It was very steep much of the way.  Definitely a difficult hike but I can tell the views would have been worth it about 2 week ago.
45,2017-10-05,[''],Steep! Awesome kick butt workout!
46,2017-10-04,['hiking'],This was a doozy. 6-8” of snow on the upper third of the hike and no clear trail. Took me 2 hours up and just over 1 to get down. Views are beautiful. Fall color is visible in the lower valleys. Worth the work.
47,2017-09-30,[''],"One of my favorites, took für pass back down... had to bush whack, since this trail is not used often. So beautiful though, and way easier on the knees. Ran into a moose!"
48,2017-09-15,[''],difficult but great views at the top. get ready for some steep climbs. we went when the wildflowers were out of bloom but could tell how beautiful it would have been!
49,2017-09-12,['hiking'],"Get the hiking boots or shoes ready! Steeeeeeeep trail, aggressive grade pretty much all the way to the top. It flattens out a bunch of times throughout the hike, only to get you ready to go up. The hike up is challenging, and most likely you will be staring at the ground. But the top and the way down is well worth it. The views while hiking down make it seem like a different trail! Have fun! Bring water!"
50,2017-09-10,['hiking'],LOVED this hike. It is verrrrry steep though. The first mile feels like 271921 miles but it is so so worth it once you get to the top. The only thing was that there was no running water for the dogs. Wear good shoes and bring lots of water!
51,2017-09-08,['hiking'],"The trail was great! The first two miles do feel more like 10, but totally worth it one you are at the top! If you track your trip on the app you will see that the miles take forever to complete. We Took short breaks as needed. We packed lunch and had it atop the mountain! We would definitely do it again earlier in the day. The way down was a lot quicker, we did it in about 3.5 hours total"
52,2017-08-24,[''],"Definitely difficult but gorgeous and well worth it when you get to the view at the top.

Took my pup and he loved every second of it. Saw a nice bull moose on the way down.. luckily some people coming up scared him off.

Also! It may be helpful to know, as I almost went up the wrong way, when you get to the giant rock field and start preparing yourself to climb it, look to your left and there's a big boulder, the trail is right next to that :)"
53,2017-08-20,['hiking'],You gotta work for it but the views are spectacular! Took the dog and had a great time!
54,2017-08-20,[''],thought I did 7 miles but I guess that's from bowman fork.
55,2017-08-17,['hiking'],"Hike risk, high reward. Hands down one of my favorite hikes in all of Utah! It's tough, but the wildflower, forests, and views are beyond worth it!"
56,2017-08-06,[''],Amazing experience
57,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"Short but steep for a hike, not lightly travelled but wildflowers were beautiful and views from the summit were spectacular.  Mr. Bull Moose delayed my departure for a bit, had to bushwhack around him."
58,2017-07-30,['hiking'],"5 stars for the view--3 stars for the crazy amount of work to get that view :)

One of the most physically strenuous hikes I've ever done due to the rapid ascent. It was a 4.5 mile hike, but felt like a 10 mile one. Legs were jello at the end.

The wildflowers were generally out in force, although the cone flowers were spent for the season. There were sections with shoulder high flower stalks!

The view from Gobbler's Knob is great--you get a good view of Salt Lake, and Big Cottonwood Canyon, AND Millcreek Canyon.

I did manage to get off-trail though. There's a section where you need to cross a rock fall. For some reason I decided to go up the fall ... that added an extra 45 minutes, and it was exhausting. I found the ""right"" trail coming back down. I deserve a merit badge for my stupidity, or something, for that one.

Also a heap of blessings upon a pair of hikers that shared a bag of frozen grapes with me--the most delicious trail snack ever!"
59,2017-07-25,[''],The wildflowers are incredible.
60,2017-07-24,[''],"Mostly uphill and rocky, views are incredible, well worth every second. Watch for moose though, a large bull had bedded down on the trail so we had to bypass him via some pines."
61,2017-07-23,['hiking'],"this is an amazing hike I found it difficult went straight up the basin trail this morning and walked to baker pass and followed bowman fork back to the main trail down. this fork is much easier than the main trail but is extremely over grown, making it hard to navigate at times. but overall this is by far one of the best and the hardest hikes I have ever been on. looking forward to doing it again some time"
62,2017-07-19,['hiking'],"This is one of the best hikes in the Wasatch. It's very strenuous but it pays off at the top. The views are incredible.

I've hiked this four times in the past and I've seen a moose every time."
63,2017-07-05,['hiking'],"Gorgeous views from Alexander Basin! There's still a snowfield on the last climb to the peak and I didn't want to try and make it past by myself, especially given how steep it was and how I didn't tell anyone where I was going :) I'll definitely be back later in the summer!"
64,2017-07-04,[''],"this trail was so beautiful. we are definitely going back. its steep, but as long as you keep a decent pace you'll do just fine. worth going to the top."
65,2017-06-27,['hiking'],The gate up the rest of the canyon does not open until July 1st. It's over 3 miles up the road past the gate to get to the trail head. This is also true to get to Dog Lake Trail head on this side.
66,2016-10-31,['hiking'],"This hike was a good one! Its really steep right at the beginning, mellows out for a little ways then gets steep when you are walking up the final 1/2 mile.  Saw a moose and some Elk on the way up.  The trail was muddy since it is in the shade the entire way."
67,2016-10-01,['hiking'],Majestic and worth the climb.
68,2016-09-23,[''],"This is my new favorite hike up the Millcreek area! Defiantly a rough hike for me (especially because I was carrying a 47lb pack with a toddler in it), it took me four hours to complete the entire hike. The views were amazing! We did the hike late September and the fall foliage was beautiful. I'm definitely doing this one again!"
69,2016-09-18,[''],very pretty. Pretty difficult.
70,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Really Beautiful hike with steeper climbs alternating between lovely meadow/basin areas.  I saw two young bull moose hanging out about 2/3 of the way up, it seems this area is a favorite for moose.  No question that it's steep, but well worth it with a gorgeous trail and rewarding summit with wonderful views."
71,2016-08-26,[''],Great trail! Very steep in most sections. Somewhat slippery over gravel and sand. Beautiful views! Our dog loved it too.
72,2016-08-23,[''],"difficult hike, some light scrambling towards the top, view is amazing at the top. A lot of trees to start and then little shade, sun exposure is a lot so bring tons of water. We went mid afternoon and I went through 4 liters of water plus! Love that dogs are allowed!"
73,2016-08-13,['hiking'],"I gave this trail a five because of the views from the summit. As mentioned by others this is a steep trail. The recorded track came in at 2,800+ ft in less than a 2 miles. Trekking poles were very helpful on the steep parts coming down. Just missed seeing three moose by 15 minutes"
74,2016-08-07,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, lots of wildflowers, great views and a good likelihood of seeing moose. Very steep trail though so wear shoes with good traction for the way back down."
75,2016-07-30,['hiking'],Spectacular views although go early or later in the year. Despite are early departure Me and my fellow hiker drank all of our water going up (2 liters each). I had to run across the road to the creek at thr end to cool off! Dont attempt in the extreme heat!
76,2016-07-25,[''],"Great out and back hike to start late in the day.  The wildlife was fantastic, 5 moose total: 3 bulls a cow and calf."
77,2016-07-19,['hiking'],"Great hike, do it soon because the flowers are absolutely amazing on the upper basin and ridge line!  Two things to note about this trail:  the trailhead is 7100ft and Gobblers Knob is about 10250ft, so the 1600ft gain listed here is laughably inaccurate.  Second, I've seen at least one moose in the upper basin every time I've done this hike so be aware of your surroundings, don't have headphones in, etc."
78,2016-07-07,['hiking'],"Great hike! It's only 2.6 miles one way to the summit, but the steep pitch really wears you out. It took me about 3.5 hours round trip as well, with a steady pace of walking and running. It could take up to 5 hours if you don't hike much, but any hiker can do and will enjoy the hike."
79,2015-09-08,['hiking'],This trail isn't bashful about a climb.  Worth it at the top though!
80,2015-08-23,['hiking'],We reached Alexander's via Bowman Fork. It was quite the bushwhacking experience!! Gorgeous views amazing foliage and quite the hike. Not for the faint of heart! Definitely worth the effort. As others have mentioned lots of biting flies. Be sure to take repellant.
81,2015-07-30,['hiking'],This is a great hike! Took me closer to 3.5 hours round trip then the suggested 5 hours. The trail is fairly steep but each peak takes you into another basin. The final summit is more of a scramble up rocks (bring poles) but the views and flowers up here are well worth the trip! There were some large biting flies so I would suggest putting on repellant before hand.
82,2015-07-25,[''],Beautiful!
83,2015-06-02,['hiking'],I used this as a route to Gobbler's Knob. Quite steep and very beautiful.
84,2014-08-10,[''],"Meadow after alpine meadow.  Every bowl leads to greater and grater alpine wilderness.  We hiked August 3rd and saw a glorious amount of flower.  At least three very, very distinct and individual varieties of Indian Paint Brush.   See my review about Gobblers Knob and getting stuck in a lightning storm in early August but without question the best area for wild flower I've yet to see."
85,2013-07-08,['hiking'],"I was warned by a fellow hiker at the trail head that this was a pretty gnarly hike due to the loose rock and steep trail and that I may enjoy an easier hike down the canyon. This only fueled me desire to conquer this trail. With that said, yes it is a pretty steep trail to start out but then you get to the switch backs and it became very enjoyable with a stead climb. I came unprepared with vans shoes and a bottle of water. Hiking shoes (obviously) and even trekking poles would have been a Good idea.Nice views from the basin and top with rolling meadow areas. The only huge downside is the flys! Apply bug spray or you will be covered even when moving.    "
