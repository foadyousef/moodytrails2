Kind of rocky but not so bad you can’t pick your way through them.   Stayed at Notch lake, mosquitoes were horrible and fishing was slow. Rained quite a bit but we were camping in the mountains with family so it was good times.   It helps when you are prepared for bad weather.  "
4,2019-07-20,"['backpacking', 'bugs']","My group of six backpacked for three nights at Bench Lake (about half a mile past Notch) and we had a beginner backpacker with us. A great beginner trail! Only very small patches of snow left but none on the trail. Rocky at times. Decline in and incline out but it really isn’t too bad. Mosquitos were swarming us at Bench Lake, even with full strength deet spray and a thermacell - the worst was every night between 6-9 pm. No fish (we did see leeches and salamanders) at Bench Lake but solid fishing at Notch. Notch Lake had a ton of people staying there and the bugs were just as bad. If you can stand the bugs, I absolutely recommend this trail. "

6,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow', 'washed out']","Went there on Saturday there is at least 2 to 3 feet of snow on the beginning of this trail. We turned back will try again later on summer. Some roads on these area still closed. If you miss winter go for it:). I gave 5 star because AllTrails don’t let you comment without rate, the area is so beautiful I bet the trail will be as well."

8,2018-09-10,['backpacking'],Highly recommend. Beautiful backpacking spot. Lakes all over.
9,2018-07-29,['hiking'],Went in early on a Friday and hiked by ourselves and it was beautiful... on the way out that afternoon we passed 60+ people. Crazy busy!
10,2018-07-07,[''],Loved this hike!  Wild flowers were beautiful!
11,2018-06-17,['hiking'],"This was the perfect hike. Downhill to the lakes and the way back up was not bad! Definitely an easy hike you could take your whole family on to get some amazing view of lakes, mountains and meadows. I'm an avid hiker and absolutely loved this trail."
12,1999-07-31,['hiking'],Nice easy trail that you go mostly down to get to the lake and then have to climb mostly up to get back. My wife thinks that this trail is uphill both ways. Notch Lake is a reservoir so there is a lot a bare shoreline in the fall. Some people like to jump from the cliffs on the opposite side. Bench Lake is also a litter past Notch Lake
