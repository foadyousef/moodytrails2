1,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"This trail is steep in places. Many hike up it. I haven’t done serious hiking for awhile. I am 65 years old. It took awhile, but I made it. Hiked with my 27 year d son."
2,2019-08-24,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",
3,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"gravel, well marked trail. I'm a beginning ""hiker"" and this was a moderate trail as far as distance and terrain of trail but it is very steep. "
4,2019-08-02,['hiking'],Did this trail today because Battle Creek trail was closed. It was super steep for most of the trail. We had 6 kids with us and they couldn't make it to the end. We went until we saw the G a d then turned around. Not a ton of shade so it was pretty warm even before 10 am. The view of the valley is pretty amazing though. 
5,2019-06-10,['hiking'],Super steep but beautiful and rewarding! 
6,2019-06-06,['hiking'],"It was cool to go to the G, but the actual trail is poorly marked."
7,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'no shade']","Not my favorite, but it's west-facing on the front of the mountain, so it's a good option if the mountain trails in the canyons are still snowy. 
This trail is SUPER steep (use poles on the way down if you have knee issues) and exposed with little shade.
The views at the G don't supersede the views you have on the whole trail."
8,2019-05-19,['hiking'],"Agree with other reviews of pretty steep at the beginning and end. It was raining so it was muddy but especially so closer to the top, though we still did fine. Took me an hour and 15 total to get up and back down but I had my small dog with me so we stopped more frequently. Great views and a good distance though. There were a couple spots where there are multiple options to follow for the trail so I was never sure if I was in the right spot but always kept going and I got there just fine. "
9,2019-05-04,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",Perfect for Spring! It was fun for the kiddos.
10,2019-04-28,['hiking'],Steep in the beginning and the end. Quick half hour or so up. I do this hike about 3 to 5 days a week. Recommend hiking boots and water.

12,2019-04-10,['hiking'],"The hike itself isn't very long and it didn't feel as steep as hiking the Y; however,  the trail was far more narrow and slick making seem less kid friendly than the Y hike.  Hiking without stopping, the hike only took 32 minutes but it shares a starting point with Battle Creek so you can knock that one out while you're there as well.  Beautiful views of the valley."
13,2019-03-30,['hiking'],diffantly steep at the beginning and end but would do again.  much more fun than the Y and a lot less busy!
14,2019-03-19,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Very good hike! I had to stop a few times on the way up because it was so steep that my calf muscle were burning. Very good view the whole way up and down. I would definitely recommend going on this hike!
15,2018-12-11,['hiking'],"Hiked up hoping to get above the smog, but this wasn't quite high enough. Trail was mostly in good shape, just a bit wet and muddy in a few places, otherwise you were walking on gravel and a little bit of packed snow.

On the way back down, we saw a handful of Bighorn Sheep about a quarter mile from the trail head. Very cool!"
16,2018-11-24,[''],"Good hike, steep and rocky but definitely worth the view. I think hiking it in the fall would make for a little bit of a prettier hike, but it wasn’t too bad."
17,2018-11-23,[''],I would recommend this hike in the fall. Not much color now all the trees have lost their leaves and there grass is brown. But for this area the grass is brown most the summer to. Great views of the valley.
18,2018-09-17,[''],Hiked with a 10 month baby and thought the hike was pretty good. It’s super steep going up and gives you a great challenge. I’d recommend hiking boots and water!
19,2018-08-04,['hiking'],Meh. Good for kids. That’s about it.
20,2018-07-01,[''],"Trail was good, the ‘G’ was disappointing, not nearly as nice as the ‘Y’.
Great view of the valley for most of the hike."
21,2018-06-09,['hiking'],super fun hike but very steep. Not very much shade so be prepared! Bring lots of water and a hat.
22,2018-05-23,[''],"New hiker with kids, the first half of the trail was extremely steep and shadeless. 2nd half more wooded and evened out. At the G my son (5) tumbled down the steps next to the G and cut his head and got scrapes. Had to get 3 stitches. Be careful around the G!"
23,2018-05-21,[''],"This was not a good hike. It is not kid friendly at all. Steep, narrow and no shade made for a very boring and rough hike for kids. Luckily we had cloud cover. I can’t imagine what it would be like in the full sunlight. Also there is nothing to do at the top and 0 shade."
24,2018-05-16,['hiking'],"so... I am a beginning hiker but since the weather's been beautiful I so want to take advantage of all the opportunities there are to hike in these beautiful mountains. I didn't actually find the G Trail sign so I ended up going along a different trail that put me kind of hiking up the face of the mountain which was very steep. at the end I hiked up higher so I could connect to the main G Trail and hiked that on the way down. it was very difficult very steep very narrow, & slippery with gravel. I thought it was a pretty hard hike, and not moderate at all, at least for a beginner hiker. However, it was absolutely beautiful up there and I'm glad I did it."
25,2017-09-15,[''],"Not my favorite but not a terrible hike. Only rating this as a two because of lack of shade and a very narrow trail for much of it. It was fun to ""bushwhack"" and explore the woods as I did geocaching with my Dad! This is right behind his house. Hiked this July 18, 2016. It was neat to learn about the letters representing different towns/cities and how the local HS lights it every year! I can always see the G visiting my Dad's house so it is nice to say I have been there! :-)"
26,2017-08-07,['hiking'],great other than the lack of shade.
27,2017-07-17,[''],A low-shade hike to one of the local letters. Nice views of the valley.
28,2017-07-12,[''],I loved it! it was easy without being boring.
29,2017-05-29,[''],"Better than the Y hike! You get some shade from trees along the way on occasion, no switchbacks, and also has a great view throughout. I enjoyed it! It is a steep climb though, so bring water!"
30,2017-05-29,[''],"Nice view of the valley the whole time. Dog friendly, and a little challenge. perfect distance."
31,2017-05-07,[''],Steep incline but short hike. Good visibility of valley for most of hike. Not a lot of shade  in summer so it gets real hot. Be sure to bring lots of water for you and your dog!
32,2017-04-23,['hiking'],"Carried 1-year old twins up, and the 3, 6, and 7 year old kids did well. I met fewer people on the trail than I expected. It was also steeper than I expected. Great views of the valley most of the trail."
33,2017-04-01,['hiking'],"Hiked it with my 3 year old. We had to take a few breaks, but made it just fine. Views at the top and throughout are amazing."
