5,2019-07-03,[''],"This is a great horseback riding trail. Especially great in the morning. Lots of shade, gorgeous meadows, spectacular views all the way up and at the top, you can see forever. Bikers  have always been courteous and willing to yield right of way to horses. It takes about 2 1/2 hours to ride the loop at a walk. I am guessing that you can almost double that if you are on foot. Great place to spend the day."

8,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Went last weekend. Great trail. Nice views. Extreme mud in places. Still some snow at the top. Still pretty easy and fun all things considered.

10,2019-04-19,['hiking'],Always a great trail.  If I am going to share a trail with someone that hasn't been in the area this is where I will bring them.  You can take the short route and just go up to the Overlook or you can make a day of it and circle Sardine.  I might be a little bias since I spend most my winter is this area.  This was an incredible year for snowshoeing.  Great spot to keep in mind for next year.
11,2018-11-27,[''],Enjoyed the work out!  Great ride/workout under 1.5 hours.
12,2018-11-05,['mountain biking'],"This is one of my favorite mtb trails.  It has a southern exposure which means that on warm sunny days I always fill up the water pack.  I have ridden the trail loop clockwise and counterclockwise.  I prefer clockwise.  I now ride with tubeless tires, but even before I had tubless tires I found the climb to not be  as foreboding as it appears from the parking lot.  I like to deflate my rear tire so that there is just a touch of give.  The first third of the ascent is gradual with good traction.  The second third is steeper and exposed  with some rocky terrain to impede the climb.  The rewards are great views of Snow Basin to the right and after a short ride great views to the west.  The final third is less rocky and better traction to the saddle on the the summit.

I like to reinflate my tires back up to 50 psi, drop my seat a bit, and do a quick assessment my bike before the descent.  The downhill ride is a hoot!  It seems like I'm riding downhill forever.  With very few rocks, banked turns, easy switchback turns and long descents.  After getting down to the bottom I wanted to do it again.  Follow the trail over the bridges traveling clockwise until you hit the gravel path.  Make a left to the parking lot.  Or hang a right and do it again."
13,2018-10-22,[''],Conquered this loop with my son and sister and n-law and nephew.  So much fun..
14,2018-09-04,[''],"This was a really pleasant hike. Utah has been so dry this year that, unfortunately, it wasn't the most beautiful hike (everything was brown and dead once the early morning light had gone away), but it was still a fun hike. I'd agree with other reviewers: it's not really a difficult hike -- especially not going up Sardine and down Ogden Outlook: if you're looking for a slightly more challenging (but still comfortable) hike, I'd start up Ogden Outlook and then come back down Sardine. I would have liked this hike more if there weren't some aggressive mountain bikers. I don't mind sharing the trail, but I get bothered when mountain bikers go flying around turns too quickly and are acerbic. Most bikers were fine, but there were a few who were too aggressive. We also saw a moose, and we heard a rattlesnake near the top, so do be mindful of wildlife in the area."
15,2018-08-28,['mountain biking'],"For the ogden and surrounding areas this is one of the best trails you can take on for mountain biking or for a shorter hike. A lot of shade, nice views, and smooth singletrack makes for an enjoyable ride. Just watch out for corners and blind spots where some bikers/runners seem to think they always have the right of way"
16,2018-08-26,['hiking'],Nice hike. Looking forward to doing it again when the smoke has cleared to get some better views. Not hard at all.
17,2018-08-21,['trail running'],This is a great trail.  As has been mentioned in previous reviews there are a lot of mountain bikers but it isn’t to hard to get around each other.  The views are incredible we saw a moose pretty early on.  We’ll be bringing the kids back in the fall for a family hike.
18,2018-08-14,['hiking'],Not sure who picks the difficulties of these hikes. Not a hard hike unless you are talking about the fast maneuvers to get out of the bikers way.  great trail with great views.
19,2018-08-12,[''],I wouldn't rate this trail as hard. I would say more moderate. we started at 7 am this morning. The weather was cool with an awsome view from both ogden lookout and Sardine peak.
20,2018-07-13,[''],Nice views on top watch out for snakes
21,2018-07-01,['hiking'],"As a hike, it was spectacular but there were A LOT of mountain bikers so stay on the lookout.  If you’re a mountain biker, I’d recommend a bell for your bike so that we know you’re coming."
22,2017-12-23,['cross country skiing'],"When it really snows I like to cross country ski or fat bike this loop. There is minimal foot and even snowshoe traffic, due to the length and difficulty. Good for strong skiers to tackle. I like going counter clockwise and this affords a decent down by the power poles if you ski with full metal edges. With fresh powder try to beat the snowboard crowd up to the top. The reward  is AT  ski nirvana. Fat bike it on lesser days too."
23,2017-12-13,['hiking'],"This was a fun trail! Today was my first time doing it and it was beautiful. Good things about the trail is that the elevation gain is very spread out and gradual, it is very well marked and cut out, and the view from the top is beautiful. There were several great view points and I would say my favorite is actually right before you head back down the trail. This was a very difficult hike to complete in the snow, but beautiful (wear snow shoes for sure and it will be easier). Overall I really enjoyed it and it was a good level of challenging. Lots of moose tracks!"
24,2017-12-03,[''],"One of our favorites! Does see a lot of foot traffic, due to its popularity."
25,2017-10-10,[''],Beautiful hike but too many bikers
26,2017-10-07,[''],Awesome hike but I wouldn’t rate it as difficult.
27,2017-10-06,['trail running'],"Steep trail is worth it. Elk and moose in the area, lots to see."
28,2017-08-02,[''],"Great trail, awesome views!"
29,2017-07-22,['trail running'],Amazing views from both the overlook and backside of Sardine.
30,2017-07-11,['mountain biking'],Love this trail. Hiking or bikeing are both great here.  One of my favorites so far.
31,2017-07-04,[''],"It is a very brushy trail, especially on the ""back half"" of the loop (opposite Ogden overlook) but has very nice views. It's a little buggy right now, but has great flowers. I also saw several snakes so keep your eyes open. Overall, great spot for a hike, bike, ride or run!"
32,2017-06-22,[''],great for biking!
33,2016-10-17,['hiking'],"Leaves are changing in mid-September when i did this hike, and West side of the loop has the overlook and a few other places with very nice views. Getting up to Sardine Peak itself will be a scramble of a few hundred feet through underbrush - take a small trail marked hikers only southeast of the peak. If you take the wider trail directly east of it, it just takes you around - doesn't get any closer. East side of the loop has some great views of Pineview on top, but after that it's just a lot of wooded switchbacks that all look the same. Good for bikers, but made for a boring last half of the hike."
34,2016-09-04,['hiking'],What a workout...but the views will keep us coming back time after time! ♡
35,2012-09-01,[''],"Top ten favor for run, bike."
