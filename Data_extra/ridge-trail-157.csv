You can see way down into American Fork Canyon in one direction, and clear into Heber Valley in the other. You also get majestic views of Timp. In early to mid summer wildflowers flank the trail, and many are waist-high and even chest-high! This year is a late bloom, so there are forget-me-nots and lady slippers, bluebells and white umbrils, but the spectacular lupine aren’t quite out yet. ***updating today (July 16) the lupine are out and the trail is just breathtaking!

The first section of the trail alone practically overloads you with beauty !  Something new and gorgeous presents itself around every bend. 

I am an artist, and I’ve made several paintings of various vistas from this particular trail. Including some horses, the lupine, with Timp as a backdrop, and stormy skies and colorful foliage in the fall. It is beautiful every time of year you can access it.



Note: Horses, bikes and motorbikes are also permitted on this trail. But the motorbikes should be banned! There is nothing worse than having your peaceful hike in the mountains interrupted by a noisy motorbike, followed by the lingering stench of gas and oil. That is seriously the only drawback to this incredible trail! "

Great hike for larger dogs; some parts get a bit steep but it’s well worth it. 
You’ll come to a point close to Tibble Fork where a sign points to the trail, of you go the opposite direction you come out by the dam at Tibble Fork."

Start on ridge-157 and make your way back in the Elk Camp trail. It makes for the perfect loop that’s challenging and rewarding with some great views. Occasionally you might run into some wild like - deer, elk, and especially moose (see photos)"

From the Alpine Loop Summit parking area, start hiking on the Lame Horse Trail. You come to a trail junction quickly (.1 mile). Go left at the junction, taking the South Fork Little Deer Creek Trail 252 downhill in the aspens. The trail comes to a road and stop sign. Cross the road to the trail post. At .60 miles you come to the first of many meadows. The trail descends for 1.6 miles and crosses Deer Creek. Today this was really just wooden walkways with no water running underneath. The next landmark is the Cascade Scenic Drive Highway. The unmarked trail continues directly across the highway. From the highway, the trail starts up for the ridgeline in a sagebrush meadow. You leave the meadow for an aspen grove, then scrub oaks and finally conifers near the top. At 3 miles, the trail open up and smooths out to spectacular views of Mount Timpanogos. You arrive at the ridgeline and trail junction. Go left on Ridge Trail 157. Don't take the trail heading downhill. This section takes you to the highest point and the trail drops to the junction for Mud Springs. At this junction and all other junctions, stay to the left. Stay on Ridge Trail 157. The trail takes you back to the Summit parking area. Other users on the trail are mountain bikes and motorcycles. This is a beautiful loop hike with diverse terrain!

Directions: In Utah County, take Highway 92 (Alpine Loop Road) up American Fork Canyon or Sundance Canyon. Drive to the summit and park at the Summit trailhead.

Destination: Loop views
Difficulty: Moderate
Round trip: 6.5 miles
Hiking time: 2.5 hrs"

6,2015-08-19,[''],This is an amazing ride. Well worth the time. I plan on making it a regular trip.
7,2015-06-15,['mountain biking'],Best mountain biking I've ever done!
8,2015-06-08,['mountain biking'],"We rode the Ridge Trail from the Summit Trailhead and looped back on the South Fork Deer Creek Triail. From that direction we had a fun downhill ride through some pine forests and popped out just above the Elk Camp. The climb from there to the summit was uphill the whole way but wasn't too terrible, following a creek, forests, and meadows to the summit."
9,2015-06-07,['mountain biking'],"We rode this trail from the Summit Trailhead to the junction with South Fork Deer Creek Trail 252. The views along the Ridge Trail were incredible. Much better views of Timpanogos and the surrounding mountains than you can see from the road. We encountered a bull moose just feet from the trail and a lot of deer as well. The trail passes through forests and meadows with amazing views all along the way. The trail has a lot of ups and downs but nothing too difficult. The trail is also used by dirt bikes, but we mostly saw other bikers and hikers. Would definitely do this trail again."
