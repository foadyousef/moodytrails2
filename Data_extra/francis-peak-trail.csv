1,2018-06-19,['off road driving'],Very fun little off roading trail. Has a quite a bit of rocks and puddles so I recommend something with some ground clearance. Very pretty view up there!

Farmington Canyon road is no longer plowed in winter, and you will find the gate locked early in the season just above Farmington Pond.  We love skiing around the Farmington Flats area, and we miss the winter access!  But it's still a fun little mountain biking loop when the road is open.  Our six year old had no problem with this trail, and was happy to see a little fawn along the way.  Beautiful area.  Narrow winding dirt road with steep drop offs."
