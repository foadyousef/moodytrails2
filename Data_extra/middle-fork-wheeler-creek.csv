I would suggest starting at old snow basin road, rather than the suggested route, just alot more fun..not difficult, well maintained trail, few bikes or others on trail when I went there, incline is gradual, there are some rocky areas but overall its on the lower end of a 'moderate trail..this is a must for fall colors!"
1,2019-07-21,['hiking'],it was pretty hot. didn't finish and quite a bit of 
2,2019-07-05,['hiking'],"Decent trail. About 50% tree coverage, and the coverage there is isn't that great. There's a small creek about halfway you can refill water at if you have a filter. Otherwise you'll probably be happier with 2 liters. I was up there in about 80 degree weather 3pm-6pm and the sun was brutal. A lot of nice views though. I saw a total of three people on the trail, all on bikes. And I didn't see the first one until about 5 miles in."

4,2018-04-05,['hiking'],Looks great for later in the season but still too muddy for us after a day of skiing... We were passed by some trail runners though!
5,2017-12-23,['mountain biking'],"Combined with the lower Wheeler Creek trail this was a slow burn of a fat bike ride. I also enjoy this route on metal edged cross country skis when fresh snow has deep cover, as it can become quite rutted as it is a popular snowshoe trail."
6,2017-07-25,['mountain biking'],"This was one of the first mountain biking trails I've ever done. It was challenging for a beginner, but very doable."
7,2017-07-11,['hiking'],Good easy hike. Always lots of people and finding a place to park can be hard.
8,2017-05-29,['hiking'],We did the East Fork/Middle Fork loop this afternoon. It wasn't too busy considering the holiday but we should have either started earlier or waited for the evening-our dog had a hard time b/c it was pretty hot. Good thing there were plenty of streams to wade through. Middle Fork has more shade but East has better views. A great hike!
9,2017-05-06,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes so far. Cant wait to hike the trail next weekend.
10,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Fun little hiking trail, but nothing spectacular in terms of views. The climb was so gradual it felt like a level walk most of the time, and the loop is a actually a series of connecting trails so without a map it got a bit confusing in areas. They should put in a map at the trailhead. Loved the wildflowers and beaver pond though."
11,2015-09-05,['hiking'],Easy but what ever you do. Do not go of the trail or you might get bit by wasps and hornets. One of my sons got 7 stings and my other son got 3 and their cousin got one on the eye.
12,2015-06-11,[''],I hike this one a lot. I usually run into moose and other wildlife and it's not too crowded. I like to connect to this from the Wheeler Creek trail. It's an easy and pretty trail.
13,2015-04-19,[''],This is a much quieter section of trail than I expected - I did not see anyone else during my walk through this section. Must have been my lucky day.
14,2015-04-12,['hiking'],Mild winter allowed for this amazing hike with my brother. The trail was hard packed snow and we even saw a couple of mountain bikers out. I will be back in the summer to hike this amazing trail again.
15,2013-09-05,['hiking'],"I have hiked and biked this trail several times.  If you hiking it, it is best to to this one in the morning, by the afternoon this trail is usually being used quite a bit by bikers.  When we biked this we went across the old snowbasin road took it up to the top of the hill and finshed out the trail by looping along the mapels trail around to snowbasin and back to the Green pond trail, about 8 miles, tons of fun."
16,2012-07-23,['mountain biking'],Beautiful bike or hike.  I think best enjoyed on a Mt. Bike.
