I recommend following the direction as guided by All trails, that way you get this steepest part on the gravel road instead of the washed out trail coming down from twin lakes. Lots of parking at the base. We saw moose and deer. It was not an easy trail to follow if you didn't have a map or All Trails- lots of little paths and crossings. Taking our time it took about 2 hours 15mins. "

5,2019-07-17,['hiking'],Wonderful hike! Not too many people
6,2018-09-19,[''],"This is a wonderful hike! Gorgeous views and variety. Take it counterclockwise from Silver Lake Rec center (hitting Twin Lakes before Lake Solitude). The first half of the trail was crowded on a late Saturday afternoon, but the second half was empty.  

Note: as you’re coming down after Lake Solitude, be careful to stay on the trail. You’ll be walking down an access road and see another small lake ahead of you. As soon as you see it, take the (mostly unmarked) small cutoff to the left. We walked an extra half mile down the road before realizing we had left the trail."
7,2018-08-25,['hiking'],This is a nice loop. It passes near the Solitude ski lift
8,2018-08-01,[''],a great intermediate hike. amazing wildfowers and last time there was a bull moose feeding on the edge of lake solitude.
9,2018-07-30,['hiking'],"The hike from Silver Lake to Lake Solitude is super easy. We arrived at Lake Solitude at dusk, and it was gorgeous. It then gets much steeper as it winds along a road. The view of Twin Lakes from the top is AMAZING! Coming down to Twin Lakes from up top is quite steep and narrow. Then beware of a large section of loose little rocks on the way back down to Silver Lake from Twin Lakes - worth it for amazing views (especially from one little spot off to the side of the trail)."
10,2017-10-20,['hiking'],"This was a beautiful hike. The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it isn't well marked. There are many trails that shoot off, and it is easy to get on the wrong trail, which happened to my husband and I.  Thankfully, I used the map from this app which took into account my location via GPS to see where we were. This came in handy when we found ourselves on the wrong trail, which ended up being a shortcut. We went to Lake Solitude first before making the trek up to Twin Lakes. The hike from Silver Lake to Lake Solitude inclined but only moderately and was easy. After Lake Solitude the trail climbs abruptly up to Twin Lakes. The view of Twin Lakes was stunning. We would definatley do it again!"
