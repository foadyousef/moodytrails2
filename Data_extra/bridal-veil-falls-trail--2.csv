0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],Heavy traffic trail but worth it. I would highly recommend hiking up to the upper Falls.
1,2019-09-03,['hiking'],The waterfall itself is amazing you can park at the trailhead and walk but it is very crowded with people and bikes. If you are interested you can continue driving down the road and park right at the waterfall and enter the trail there. I would recommend seeing this waterfall then continuing down the trail to Upper Falls it is also nice with way less people.
2,2019-08-30,['hiking'],Great short paced trail for family. The falls were beautiful. We brought our Frienchie and they had ice cream at the end. 
3,2019-08-27,['hiking'],"Short and sweet! Half paved, half rocky, but very do-able !!! Loved it! For the short time we had in Provo, it was perfect!"
4,2019-08-26,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail with rewarding falls. Within the first mile, you’ll see families picnicking near the river, and see the beautiful veil falls. Good for biking and bringing dogs. Pretty heavily trafficked. For more of a challenge, also do the upper falls trail. There were ribbons lining the trail going up the trail :) the upper falls were just beautiful and if you turn around you’ll also see a view of a great mountain!"
5,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Easy but worthwhile trail. It’s very well shaded and stays cool, and the short hike to the falls at the end is worth it. "
6,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Super easy paved trail to walk on! It’s populated towards the afternoon, but was pretty empty and enjoyable on a Sunday morning. Just past the waterfall/bridge you can find a trail that will take you up closer to the waterfall. The trail up to the waterfall is pretty steep and very rocky. Overall, a great easy hike/walk for any ages!"
7,2019-08-24,['hiking'],Awesome trail. Must do. Easy n rewarding
8,2019-08-22,['hiking'],"I’ve run this trail a million times, it’s super easy and can be done by walking in about 10 minutes! Fun, quick hike. "
9,2019-08-17,['hiking'],will definitely go on this trail again! so pretty 
10,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"The paved path is awesome for anybody! We did some hiking as well. Right after the falls, there is a path that goes up where you can stand at the base of the main falls. It is very rocky and steep but we took our dogs up it and we were fine! We went on the Upper Falls trails too. It is also rocky and steep but definitely worth the hike up - no one else was there! It was awesome."
11,2019-08-16,['hiking'],I wouldn't call this a hike but our dogs love walking this trail! 
12,2019-07-28,['hiking'],It was a nice hike.  The only problem I had was that people riding their bikes weren't as considerate as they should have been.  When I'm riding my bicycle and there are people ahead of me I announce myself and inform them which of their sides I'm passing on.  But maybe that's just me. 
13,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Great trail run!! Beautiful view and Provo canyon parkway right next to it:))
14,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'rocky']","This is one of our family favorites!  Easily accessible and only a short hike up to the falls.   Once yippy get up there,  it's a gorgeous view of not just the falls but also the canyon. 
It can get pretty busy along the base of the falls on the paved walkway,  especially on the weekends.  If you go with kids and you want to hike up to the falls like we always do-  stay on the switchback trail (zig zagging up)  sometimes it looks like the trail goes straight up-  don't take that trail!  If you're on the proper trail,  you should be switchbacking (across, from side to side until you reach the falls).  We have accidentally taken one of the trails that goes straight up and it is to steep for kids, with the loose dirt and rocks it is hard to grip the ground and end up sliding down the hill.   Doable for an adult but was a little  scary for my 4 and 9 year old.   Since then we have been mindful to stay on the switchback trail all the way up to the falls.   All in all,  one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the state in my opinion."
15,2019-07-19,['hiking'],Beautiful!!
16,2019-07-19,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
17,2019-07-18,['hiking'],"The first part of the trail is paved and really easy, great for all skill levels and ages. The second part is up rocks and dirt and can be narrow in several places. The moms with little ones in our group had to turn back a little ways up after the paving ends. You also have to watch carefully for the turns so you don't miss them. Beautiful hike, most of it is shaded. We went in the middle of the summer so the breeze from the waterfall felt amazing."
18,2019-07-15,['hiking'],If you do more than the paved area don’t bring small children. Very sketchy and rocky if you’re climbing to the top to get a better look at the falls. 
19,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"Paved until the view area. Very easy hike, with a nice reward at the end. You can hike to the bottom of the falls from the view area, but that part is not paved."
20,2019-07-13,['hiking'],beautiful walk to the fall! 
21,2019-07-08,['hiking'],Amazing hike but can get dangerous if you don’t have the right attire on and also if you climb to high.  Coming down is the “fun” part 
22,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"The walk to the falls from the parking lot is paved and super easy. If you're looking for a very long paved trail that follows the rapids and is peaceful, go for it. It's actually a great biking trail. Walk another mile or so past the falls and you will see a graffitied house on your right there's a path that is pretty Rocky that leads you up to another water fall that you can get really close to. It was ok but there are many other hikes that I've done that were much more worth it. Plus some people clearly lacking class graffitied the thing the whole way up which is unfortunate."
23,2019-06-28,['hiking'],This isn’t much of a hike but a very beautiful view. 
24,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
25,2019-06-21,['hiking'],very short easy hike. there is a small trail that leads up to the waterfall that can be a little dangerous but well worth it.
26,2019-06-21,"['hiking', 'rocky']","My husband and I had a ton of fun on this hike together! Plenty of shade, and a good trail to follow. The falls were a great end point/cool down. "
27,2019-06-12,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",It’s very very easy. Hike up the waterfall to get a beautiful view of bridal veil and also the mountains opposite. Easy short hike. 
28,2019-06-10,['hiking'],Awesome!
29,2019-06-06,['hiking'],Nice short walk ... lots of people
30,2019-06-03,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Initial trail is easy and very pretty. Falls and Provo River are gushing with water. Easy hike from parking lot to the Falls. If you want more adventure, you can hike to the top of the lower Falls. Trail is narrow, steep and rocky and will require some scrambling. Well worth the view of the Canyon and the Falls! (6/2/19)"
31,2019-05-30,['hiking'],"This is a very easy, very family friendly paved trail. The bridal veil Falls are very pretty. From the base, it is possible to scramble up a bit to get a closer look at the falls, but it’s very loose with quite a bit of small stone under foot. 

I walked this trail May 29, 2019. There were a lot of people here, Several supervised  groups of children in bicycles we're on the trail. There were also quite a few skateboarders. 

I imagine this trail can become extremely busy in-season.

This is an extremely easy to access trail right off the main road. Although it was very pretty, it’s probably not something I would need to do again. However for those just passing through, it’s a no brainer since it is so easy to access."
32,2019-05-25,['hiking'],Easy going and beautiful! Our kids loved it!
33,2019-05-19,[''],Easy going trail with opportunities for steeper hiking. 
34,2019-05-16,[''],Easy peasy. Great for kids to scooter.
35,2019-05-11,['hiking'],Pretty busy when the weather is nice but worth it! 
36,2019-05-11,['hiking'],Nice casual walk.  Great for kids!
37,2019-05-04,['hiking'],Really easy and short. The kids always stop to play in the water.
38,2019-04-28,['hiking'],Trail isn’t really a hike but it’s fun and a great one for little kids!
39,2019-04-26,[''],It was a nice view but not really a hike at all.
40,2019-04-25,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Well worth the trek to the waterfall! Signs to the trail to stand next to the waterfall says it’s “steep” but it’s quite easy and kid friendly. There are a few spots on the trail you will need to be careful but it is a quick easy hike up. Well worth it to take a picture next to the falls. The water was freezing cold but worth standing in the water for a great picture.
41,2019-04-14,['hiking'],Parking lot still closed but parking wasn’t too bad along the road.
42,2019-04-13,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'rocky']",
43,2019-03-31,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Did this trail last summer, very beautiful! Not too hard until you climb up, or down the falls."
44,2019-03-31,[''],"Easy trail from the parking lot to the falls. If you climb to the waterfall, the trail turns steeper and more difficult. Many loose rocks. Very fun hike."
45,2019-03-27,[''],Nice trail. Parts of the trail to the falls was washed out but still passable. Clear and dry.
46,2019-03-04,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'snow']","March 3 2019. Was hoping there would be enough snow to snowshoe, but honestly some spikes or crampons would have been better. Made it on top of the ice bridge at the falls no problem"
47,2018-12-21,['hiking'],Trail almost completely covered in ice right now so it is a little hard to navigate.
48,2018-10-21,[''],Super easy walk to the falls. Great hike if you have little ones!
49,2018-10-11,[''],Easy walk to view the falls.
50,2018-10-10,['hiking'],Very pretty during the fall with some great views. The trail gets a little rocky and loose but overall it was fun and short.
51,2018-10-01,[''],"This was an amazing hike. My 4 & 6 year old even hiked straight up the waterfall to the pool where the main fall lands. Incredible views, very fun, and did this while holding my 2 year old in an ergo. *I wouldn't recommend everyone attempt that, but I feel pretty confident in my hiking abilities.

My brother-in-law did the same with his and there 3 & 5 year old did great too."
52,2018-09-22,['hiking'],The pave path most of the way makes this a much less strenuous hike until you get to the trail. There are many rough trails up marked by trail signs. I took the most eastern (up canyon) trail near the picnic table. It seems to be the best trail from what I saw
53,2018-09-07,[''],beautiful falls and shaded paved trail to the base of the falls. just pass the falls there is a bridge to the left with port-a-potties..to the right of the bridge is the safest way up the falls. it is dirt narrow trail that then turns to gravel and rock. Very narrow all the way up but not strenuous. Just nerve wracking that you could slip! We took our 12 yr kld daughter and I was so afraid she would slip. people were carrying babies and toddlers and i think they were nuts!! once to the falls it ia gorgeous and fun!
54,2018-09-03,['walking'],It is so beautiful!! it's a very nice place to take your family or yourself for a nice walk. No parking fee.
55,2018-08-21,[''],family friendly
56,2018-08-20,[''],"July 2018 - The trail is in two parts, there is the paved trail along the bottom caynon next to Provo River. Well maintained as part of the Provo river trail, many parking lots, and food trucks. The trail to go up the to the mid-point of the falls is pretty skech in places. Very narrow in many parts, and loose shale rock everywhere. There are a few places where the the trail has clearly been wiped out by rock slides and is a little puckering for the less then fleet of footed. There is also another option to get to the mid-point, climb the falls themselves, lots of loose shale rock, water, and steep."
57,2018-08-01,['hiking'],"My 8 year old son loved climbing through the waterfall to the upper falls. I thought this hike would be too crowded to be much fun, but it was actually pretty awesome despite all the people at the bottom."
58,2018-07-30,[''],"Easy getting to the falls. A little more difficult if you climb up the face of the falls to where the water is coming off the mountain, but still doable. great adventure for kids!"
59,2018-07-23,['walking'],"Not too bad for a first walk in UT. 
Traveled the route and ended up a steep rocky area (too steep for me for as of now).
You can continue walking (paved path), it’s just surrounded by trees and a river on the right for maybe 3 more miles."
60,2018-07-22,[''],"This is a lovely trail. Show up before nine - it gets busy. The easiest way up to the falls is after the sign with ""this is the right trail"" written in sharpie. Walk a little further down the paved path and you'll find the less rocky/slippery trail. 
The waterfall is gorgeous, surrounded by stair rocks that are relatively easy to climb. Had two pre-teens with us, and saw a few younger children on the trail with their grandparents."
61,2018-07-21,['hiking'],"Short, sweet and family-friendly with great views! There wasnt much of a crowd from 9-10 am when I was hiked it in July."
62,2018-07-17,[''],Easy paved trail along the Provo River but the waterfall at the end of the trail is worth the hike. Be prepared for a busy trail though
63,2018-07-10,['hiking'],This was our first hike in Utah. We just moved here from New Jersey and this trail was a warm welcome to Utah. It was perfect for my 11 ya old daughter who made it to the top. My 9yr sold loved it too. Definitely bring some shoes for both hiking and water play for the kids. They had a ton of fun. Definitely will go back.
64,2018-07-09,['hiking'],You can park just on the other side of the river from the waterfall if you want to shorten this trail.
65,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"Great falls, nice parking spot? You can hang out at the bottom or hike part of the way up. I think this is a great Sunday pit stop after being on the road a long time. Not really a hike even if you do go part way. Maybe good for a date with a girl who doesn't like to get her shoes dirty but wants the social media attention."
66,2018-07-01,[''],"Very pretty but often super crowded. Great little adventure for young families as it is short, sweet, and the “reward” is almost instantaneous thanks to the large waterfall at the end :)"
67,2018-06-27,[''],
68,2018-06-26,['hiking'],"Definitely not 1.3 out and back. More like .5 out and back. 

This trail follows the Provo River Parkway Trail. It was so quick to The Falls, we actually kept walking thinking you can get closer to it. We turned back and spent time in the pool area at the bottom. The water was shallow in some parts at the bottom, so my not so loving water baby could walk on the rocks, but not get too wet.

Nice for a fun cool off time during the summer, but really easy so it was packed with people.

Would do it again!"
69,2018-06-24,[''],Easy and beautiful.
70,2018-06-19,['walking'],"Family perfect hike. I proposed to my wife here!

great trail, mostly paved, access to parks and recreation areas. the falls look great and catch the sun rise beautifully.

Enjoy this trail and let it take you places."
71,2018-06-18,[''],"This is a great trail, I was surprised how easy and quick it was to see the waterfall! It’s a pretty waterfall but there is definitely crowding in front of the waterfall but other then that the trail was mostly cleared!"
72,2018-06-16,[''],"This is a hiking trail if you just find it! You have to park and walk the paved park first until you see the falls to your right. Keep going past them and across the bridge, and there’s a steep dirt trail (not marked) to your right that will lead you to the falls. Very pretty!"
73,2018-06-09,[''],The easiest n most beautiful waterfall. I had so much fun with my boyfriend.
74,2018-06-08,['hiking'],"Gorgeous water fall, but rather short hike on paved trail. Great for families with small kids. There is a small trail just past the bridge which leads up to the mid part of falls."
75,2018-06-05,[''],"Lovely waterfall. Great hike to do with parents, grandparents, or little kids. Wish it wasn’t so close to such a busy road"
76,2018-06-02,[''],Super easy trail. Paved.
77,2018-05-31,[''],This is not a trail. This is a skateboard park with a water feature. A girl was walking a hairless cat on a leash which was awesome and made my day!
78,2018-05-12,['hiking'],"Not a ""hiking trail"" at all. It's a paved bike/skateboard/pedestrian path. The falls are certainly beautiful! It was honestly disturbing to me to see all the families allowing their young children to scramble up the rock slide towards the falls. Some were only wearing flip flops/ sandals. The slide is not stable and I'm unsure why folks think it's a good idea to climb up. Aside from that, a nice evening stroll."
79,2018-05-10,['hiking'],"This was a super easy hike. We tried going up the dirt path to the higher part of the falls, but turned back because we didn’t have our gear with us. The falls were beautiful!"
80,2018-04-09,['hiking'],"Easy hike. Google Maps also has a marker for where the trailhead actually begins. We missed the real trailhead the first time we trekked the falls and ended up scrambling up the slickrock at the base of the falls, which is bad because there aren't many stable footholds. The trail is well-maintained and mostly a steady incline to the base of Bridal Veil Falls."
81,2017-10-29,[''],"This is not so much of a hike unless you climb up to the lower part of the falls. Hiking up there is a bit dangerous and not recommended for kids or people with bad footing. Other than that, it is gorgeous!"
82,2017-10-21,['hiking'],This place felt so magical. So amazing and breathtaking. Beautiful river and waterfall. Took some awesome pics and videos.
83,2017-10-16,[''],"Easy trail , good views and beautiful waterfalls"
84,2017-10-11,[''],Short hike and very easy. Views of the fall colors were amazing. Be prepared for crowds though!
85,2017-09-19,['hiking'],"The falls are certainly beautiful. But on busy summer days in the last year or two they’ve become completely overrun with people, and cars are parked clear out onto the highway. This place is getting loved to death.

To get there, after turning off the highway and going a hundred yards or so, there’s a parking lot and a really nice picnic area. You can either walk the paved path to the falls, or walk the grass and connect with the path on the other side of the picnic area. It’s an easy walking/bicycling paved path.  This is a good family area.  Alternatively, you can drive further along the old highway past the picnic area and park just across the river from the falls, and cross a footbridge there just east of the falls.  And there’s a turnout/viewpoint on the main highway up on the hill.

WARNING: This is both one of the prettiest sights in Utah County, and also one of the most dangerous places to go.  Many people have died here.  Some have died from getting into the Provo River during spring runoff, which is likely to kill you and will almost certainly kill a child who falls in or who puts a foot in the river and is swept away into the snowmelt at spring flood.  The river is immediately adjacent to the picnic area and the trail to the falls.  Some have died from falling off the cliffs.  The swarms of people have spread to the cliffs, and they just scramble all over by the dozens or even hundreds, kicking rocks loose on others.  Let me make this as clear as I can, because some people claim the best thing to do is to hike to the top of the falls.  There is no trail to the top of the falls.  There is not really even a trail to the base of the lower falls, just the remnants of an old and unmaintained trail with some sketchy spots that some people actually go across in flip flops or with babies in arms, tempting fate.  Above where the lower falls hit the slope it is mostly scrambling up the east side, and above the base of the upper falls it is rock climbing up the west side.  That is the area where most people who die on the cliffs meet their end.  There is no restaurant at the top (there used to be one, and there used to be a tram). When Utah County acquired the property it had the restaurant dismantled and the pieces flown out so it would stop attracting people.  Climbing up there as a day hike is utterly foolhardy.  If you are so abjectly stupid that you insist on trying it anyway, make sure your cell phone batteries are charged so you can get the SAR volunteers to risk their own lives to come save you when you realize that rolling the dice with your life isn’t such a good idea.

If you keep your kids away from the river, and you stay off of the cliffs, it’s a great place. In the winter it is a world famous ice climbing destination, although in 2016 the county started closing the area occasionally due to supposed avalanche danger, which is an outrageous bit of nanny state behavior."
86,2017-09-18,['trail running'],"It is a pretty waterfall with an easy trail. Almost anyone can do it. It is usually crowded so go on a weeknight or day. 
Upper falls is close by and is gorgeous with hardly any crowds. It's a little more challenging as well!"
87,2017-09-09,[''],"All paved and beautiful scenery
 very easy walk, run, bike ride"
88,2017-08-29,['hiking'],"Easy paved walk from lot to bottom of falls.  One trail for pedestrians & one for bikes ,etc.  mostly all walking in shade except for bottom of falls in full sun.  Be careful getting off & on route 197. 

The falls are outstanding."
89,2017-08-21,[''],"if you decide to go for the bottom of the falls,  look for my pics,  and take the dirt trail"
90,2017-08-08,['hiking'],"Easy, short hike, fun to play around in the waterfall at the top. Kids love it!"
91,2017-08-03,[''],Loved this hike! Easy and absolutely beautiful!
92,2017-08-01,[''],"Ok. They did repairs on it this spring, I am guessing after the two students died hiking this last fall. There were patches of small rocks that slid under your feet with no sides so you could slide down the side of the mountain. But the views were pretty"
93,2017-07-29,['hiking'],loved it! Can be busy though.
94,2017-07-29,[''],It was a great little hike to do with small kids.
95,2017-07-18,[''],"Paved path for the lower fall. There is an area at the lower falls where everyone can wade and enjoy the cool water. The path to the upper falls is narrow and steep in areas. Well worth the effort. My family walked out to the middle of the pool of the upper falls, and my twin sis climbed into the downpour!
There is an upper upper fall. We did not make any t to that one. I understand there is a trail above that some hike."
96,2017-07-18,[''],"Crowded, but great falls!"
97,2017-07-16,[''],"The paved trail to the lower part of the falls is extremely close to parking. There is currently some construction going on there, but nothing that got in the way of our Sunday hike. The path up to the falls proper has had some rock slide damage and parts of it are narrow or nonexistent now. But it is completely doable if you just watch what you are doing and go slow."
98,2017-07-14,['hiking'],Good warm up trail before hiking other trails in the area.
99,2017-06-29,[''],One of our favorite short hikes. Perfect for kids who like to explore!
100,2017-06-28,[''],Perfect little hike with small kids
101,2017-06-27,[''],"If you do this hike, you have to go to the top of the falls, where the restaurant is. I think it's being taken down now, but it makes the hike much harder and will require some climbing, but it is a blast."
102,2017-05-29,[''],"Paved trail. Did this while 8 months pregnant. Fall is along the trail; so no real hiking involved. Raging river along trail as well from snow runoff. Highly popular area - people bbqing and picnics, etc."
103,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"Great weather, easy hike, very very busy, lots of people."
104,2017-05-27,[''],Just beautiful ❤️
105,2017-05-24,[''],"Bummer, it was closed due to rock slide danger.  Sign said from Nov 2016 until further notice.  Today is May 24, 2017."
106,2017-05-24,['hiking'],"Steep, rocky, and fun; great view on top."
107,2017-05-06,[''],A lot of fun for a close in hike.
108,2017-04-22,[''],"The trail is currently closed for construction. In the meantime, you can see the falls from the main road. So beautiful!"
109,2017-04-08,[''],"The walk to the lower/base of the falls is very easy and paved. It can be done with strollers and small kids. The paved area actually goes on for about 13+ miles but doesn't ever reach the (middle or upper) falls. IF you're looking to hike to the middle and upper falls, they can only be reached by climbing the face of the falls or hiking the trail that is marked with CAUTION signs. The trail isn't to bad but has sketchy areas with small kids...definitely NO strollers, bikes etc. I would rate it Moderate..especially with kids."
110,2017-04-07,[''],been doing this one for meat 25 years the trail has been consistent and unchanging
111,2017-03-18,['hiking'],"The hike is more of a paved walking trail, but wonderful picnic and views of the falls. Did not hike up the falls which would increase difficulty for sure. Kids were riding scooters which I thought was great idea if you have little ones. Very scenic."
112,2017-02-09,['hiking'],I wouldn't call this a hike. You walk through a park that approaches the falls. You can climb up the steep rocks to get closer to the falls but it's hard and underwhelming. Still a must see if you are living/visiting Utah.
113,2016-11-10,['scenic driving'],Just a quick stopover to look at the beautiful bridal veil falls and snap a photo! It's very accessible to those who just want to see it.
114,2016-10-09,['walking'],"Our whole family did this hike a few weeks ago. It was more of a walk than a hike. It's paved the whole way to the falls which are right up close to the trail. It was extremely busy with people, dogs, bikers, and even skateboarders. Watch your little ones on the trail, we had several bikes zoom down the trail that could have easily ran down our kids if we had not pulled them to the side. Overall it was a nice easy hike with some pretty views."
115,2016-09-17,[''],It was great for a family stroll but is not really a hike. You can take the stroller as it is paved. The waterfall is pretty. It has been crowded every time I have been but it is a good place for kids to get their wiggles out.
116,2016-09-07,['hiking'],"Good, but not exciting. Don't bring Scouts or expect a challenge."
117,2016-09-05,['walking'],"Nice paved trail for a stroller. Gets you right up to the foot of the falls. Very popular hike, parking can be hard to find."
118,2016-09-05,[''],Very scenic and offers various levels of difficulty depending on if you stay on the beaten path or the more adventurous trails. Worth the climb.
119,2016-09-01,[''],Great shaded easy walk.
120,2016-09-01,['walking'],"This is a cool place if you know what you're going for. You're going because you want to walk and talk, and maybe take young kids and your small dog. I found it was hard to wrangle adolescent kids here because it was too boring for them, though. Cool falls. Grandmas and girlfriends love them. (I do too.)"
121,2016-08-24,['hiking'],The tail is great for kids and so much fun. Tons of people by the falls but still very peaceful.
122,2016-08-22,['hiking'],"Very easy and short, and you get a great and close view of one of the falls.  Definitely wear sneakers or boots, flip flops won't do with the rocky parts of the trail."
123,2016-08-17,['hiking'],"About 40 to 45 years ago we rode up that tram a few times. I think it was the steepest rise between two towers (in the world, i was told - I was young and believed anything). Also the Heber Creeper (steam train) traveled here and back to Heber City. Beautiful place."
124,2016-08-12,['walking'],Easy trial and beautiful waterfall
125,2016-08-05,['walking'],Very easy and beautiful!
126,2016-08-05,[''],Great for adventurous kids.
127,2016-08-03,[''],"Easy. Fast. Snippety snap. Beautiful. 
Romanic when hiked in the dark. 
Family friendly."
128,2016-07-30,['hiking'],"Easy hike, heavily trafficked. If you want more of a challenge, ignore the sign and keep going to Upper Bridal Veil Falls."
129,2016-07-29,[''],Easy and beautiful
130,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"Fun and easy walk. 
Ending with a beautiful waterfall. 
Kid friendly."
131,2016-07-24,['walking'],Did this last year.  Thought it was a hike so we were disappointed it was a paved walk.  If you have really small children and want a short outdoor trip then this is a perfect way to get them started.
132,2016-07-19,['walking'],A paved trail that leads you straight to the lower part of the falls. It was pretty crowded when we went in the afternoon.
133,2016-07-17,['hiking'],"It's a fun place. There is a trail available to hike the lower falls and upper falls. But we hiked the falls through the waterfall from the base, that was the thrilling part and it made the entire experience so much better. We did hike with a 2 year old but it's better to hike the usual trail with smaller kids as the waterfall trail becomes slippery after a point."
134,2016-07-02,[''],Super easy trail with a beautiful view of the mountains and waterfall
135,2016-07-01,['hiking'],Kids loved playing in the water on a hot day.  A little nerve racking with small kids around the edges
136,2016-06-30,[''],So easy and paved the whole way! Family fun hike!
137,2016-06-30,['hiking'],Loved this trail.   Would definitely do it again.
138,2016-06-23,['hiking'],"This was a easy short trail. Great views, and the kids I brought absolutely love it. We went early this morning. There were very few people there. It was cool and very pleasant about 8:45 am."
139,2016-06-23,['walking'],Perfect little trail if you have a stroller with you and are out of shape. The trail itself is nicely paved and is surrounded by trees giving you plenty of shade and a breeze. There is always traffic both ways but not too much to disrupt the experience. Perfect for a weekday nature walk with the baby.
140,2016-06-17,[''],"Super easy trail to bike, walk, or run with little ones to the falls, complete with picnic areas."
141,2016-06-10,['walking'],"Paved path the whole way up. Easy for kids. Shallow enough water for kids to play in. Honestly, too crowded for my tastes."
142,2016-06-05,[''],Short and sweet.
143,2016-05-10,[''],"Love the options around the falls. Smaller, steeper hikes off the paved trail around the park."
144,2016-04-15,[''],"Very short but very good hike  for young kids,make sure to bring quarters so they can feed the fish that was my kids favorite part!!!"
145,2016-03-23,[''],It's very short yet beautiful
146,2016-03-20,[''],"First time going up here. The trail was dry up to the falls, muddy in some spots. A great hike and not that hard to complete."
147,2016-03-19,[''],"This was actually really fun. I loved the terrain and how different it was. I can't do a continuous steep incline, I need variety. There was some ice still on the trail which made it risky but I really enjoyed it. The waterfall is incredible! Relaxing to me :)"
148,2016-02-21,['hiking'],Came here for my ASL bucket challenge.
149,2016-01-04,[''],Great option for a quick winter outing. And the falls are amazing when sculpted in ice!
150,2015-11-12,[''],"Easy stroll (we actually brought the stroller for the 1yr old) from the lot to the falls. If we didnt have the kids with us we would have attacked the steep trail leading up the falls and shot for the overlook. I did run ahead on my own and scurried up the lower portion of falls, which I would only suggest if you are a skilled climber/hiker. Overall, enjoyable little break in our day resulting in some nice family photos."
151,2015-08-22,['hiking'],Very short. Not even considered a hike. Beautiful waterfall.
152,2015-08-19,[''],"Easy, but good for kids"
153,2015-08-14,['hiking'],"It's a beautiful waterfall and very populated there, it's fun to see families having a good time and the hike only took maybe 10 minutes up and spend a few minutes in the falls before descending. Would like to try the upper falls when I'm not with a 3yo & 5yo."
154,2015-08-04,['hiking'],"Popular waterfall up Provo Canyon, right along the Provo River Trail. This tiered waterfall is the tallest in the state, and has a small pool full of rainbow trout along the Provo River Trail. View are great from the trail, or more adventurous hikers may follow a dirt/rock trail that takes you to the bottom of the falls. Small children not recommended for this part of the hike, but they will be content along the trail watching the rainbow trout. This is a great spot  that is busy on the weekends, but takes little effort to get there. One can cross the Provo River on a footbridge then walk just a couple hundred feet to the falls, or you can park near Nunn's park and walk about a half mile up the Provo River Trail to falls. There are great places for a picnic along this part of the river trail.

155,2015-07-30,['hiking'],Short walk from the parking lot. Usually lots of other people around. We use the paved trail along the river  to bike and access the Provo river.
156,2015-07-19,['walking'],"My daughters loved this spot. I call it a spot cus it's really not a hike. Bout a .25 mile paved walkway that leads you to the base of a gorgeous waterfall. 

This was my first time there and I know now when we return, we will definitely bring food to grill and hang out there. There are tables and grills along the path for families to enjoy and relax along the river. Scene is pretty cool but is right below the highway which is kind of a buzzkill if you're looking for a secluded outdoor spot. 
The fish pond had some big rainbow trouts that my kids loved, especially when they fed em. 
We came here right after a 4 mile hike from Stewart Falls and I was glad it was this easy. 
Photos uploaded from the base of the falls. I will definitely try the climb to the mid tier of the falls next time we return."
157,2015-07-13,['hiking'],It is very crowded.
158,2015-06-27,['hiking'],This is a very easy hike for all fitness levels. The falls are beautiful. It is so easy that it is often quite crowded. Paved and smooth.
159,2015-06-14,['hiking'],This has been one of our family's favorite hikes. we hiked to the base of the falls. Our children range in age from 8 to 17. We also brought our two dogs with us. We brought some friends on this hike one of which has special needs. It was perfect!
160,2015-06-09,[''],Crowded unless you go during the week.
161,2015-05-31,['hiking'],"Bridal Veil Falls has a bit of everything for everyone.  Expect crowds at all times at the base of the falls on the Provo River Parkway.  If you come to do mild hiking, you can get up close to the lowest tier of the falls where there are shallow pools.  If you feel somewhat adventurous, you can continue to the middle portion between the upper and lower tiers, although there are signs posted saying you are not supposed to.  Its a little hairy but you can go out right to the edge to the falls.  If you are a very experienced mountaineer you can go past up above the falls, but I would generally dissuade anyone from attempting this; multiple people have died attempting to get above the falls."
162,2015-03-10,['walking'],"Easy and fun for the whole family, short walk for the car park and you're at the foot off the water fall. Nice little area to feed the fishes and short hike to nearby park for a picnic."
163,2014-11-09,['hiking'],Easiest hike I've ever been on. We decided to make a little more challenging so we headed up the rocks to the actual falls and then hiked west along the mountain. Found some much more challenging stuff and some good places to set up for rock climbing. Really fun and probably headed back next week.
164,2014-10-26,['hiking'],"The waterfall is impressive, but the ""trail"" isn't much to brag about. Its a paved path. Trailhead is clearly marked and only takes a few minutes. There's an overlook a few hundred feet further up the highway that gives you the same look of the falls, so the main reason to do this ""hike"" is to either get down to the water or to do the trail up the falls."
165,2014-09-22,['hiking'],"This trail was super easy, we had a 4 year old with us on our hike and he was able to do it no problem! He didn't cross the falls, but other than that he could to it all! The falls were gorgeous and the cool mist was nice after the hike. We accidentally parked in the Viewing Area lot and had to walk down a trail to get to the lower area to start our hike, and I honestly would reccommend this! The area we walked through was full of greenery and so beautiful."
166,2014-07-18,[''],Too crowded and not as exciting of a destination as people make it out to be.
167,2014-07-16,['hiking'],Its a beautiful hike for early in the morning.  Any other time of day it is too crowded and congested to really enjoy the hike.
168,2014-05-30,[''],"I went with my friend for Memorial Day it was busy,but I like planing to go again but not in a holiday"
169,2014-05-18,['hiking'],Great hike for the whole family. The falls were beautiful. It was a little crowded but the hike can handle the crowds. Bring quarters if you want to feed the fish.
170,2014-05-07,['hiking'],"Beautiful falls, feeding the fish is fun but the facilities are poorly maintained and the hillside is cluttered with debris.

Two words to the wise:

1.  Go before temperatures start hovering around the freezing point.
2. Do NOT hike to the top of the falls unless you are properly geared and are starting out early in the day.  (Oct, 2012:  A young local university woman plummeted to her death after losing her footing while attempting to descend in trail at dusk.)"
171,2013-08-18,['hiking'],"Super short, incredibly easy hike. Great to do with younger kids. "
172,2013-07-11,['hiking'],Short easy hike.
173,2013-07-06,['hiking'],"Short steep hike up a trail to base of falls, or for more fun you can scramble up the creek itself. Beautiful falls, but super crowded. You can splash around under the falls if you want to get wet. "
174,2013-06-22,['hiking'],Very short hike up to this very picturesque falls. Very photogenic spot! A little to crowded for my taste.
175,2013-06-22,['hiking'],"Bottom line: Fun. From the start its a pretty gradual assent and nothing to crazy until you hit the actual falls. A very quick hike with a rewarding payoff. Great to take out the kids and show them a good hike and some great scenery. The trail is heavily used so please! Leave no trace! And if you go, take up a wal-mart bag and maybe hike out 5 pieces of trash or something, let's keep this place nice for years to come. =) "
176,2013-06-21,['hiking'],Very short hike and congested .... However very neat place to take some cool pics.
177,2013-06-16,['hiking'],Very quick and easy! At the bottom there is a little pond with fish in it. They have fish food that you can buy and feed the fish. Really fun for kids. If you go up the trail it's really easy and at the top you can stand right under the waterfall 
178,2013-05-19,['hiking'],"Quick, easy hike. Many people on the trail. Great views of the canyon and the mist felt good today in the hot sun. I would recommend this trail if you are looking for a quick hike or if you don't have very much time on your hands."
