0,2019-07-19,['hiking'],"A very simple trail, moderate terrain, well trafficked by bikers"
1,2019-07-03,['hiking'],decent trail. not my favorite.
2,2019-05-10,['hiking'],"Not my favorite. It’s a popular mountain bike trail which makes its tricker when running with a dog.  

When I’ve gone up during the weekday, it’s quiet and lovely! Also a great place for bonfires during the fall!"

4,2019-04-12,[''],Great trail for mountain biking!
5,2019-03-31,[''],Fun going down on a mountain bike
6,2019-03-13,[''],i think this trail is my new favorite trail to run 
7,2018-06-28,['mountain biking'],"The trail weaves back and forth across a rough rocky ""road"".  At the end of the road the trail continues, which I rode another couple of miles on.  Turns out that goes into a wilderness area, but it is not marked.   I rode it on a weekday very little vehicle traffic or bicycle traffic."
8,2018-06-07,['hiking'],"Not a bad trail. Having never been on it before, the trail was a little confusing because it crosses over the road so many times.There we're some runners and mountain bikers when i went up, but definitely not crowded.  I would definitely do this trail again. I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars if I could."
9,2018-05-29,['mountain biking'],"Not a difficult trail from an ascent or technical perspective. It is wicked fun flow on the downhill. There's a couple places to get some air and a couple mild rock gardens. I took my full-suspension, but there's nothing that a hard tail can't handle."
10,2018-04-29,[''],My favorite trail to mtb as of 4/29/18 there is snow  .1 mile into the wilderness
11,2018-04-07,['mountain biking'],I love green canyon. Don’t know why people complain about other people using it. My only complaint is off leash dogs. Please take your dogs out on this bike but please keep them on leash!
12,2018-04-04,['hiking'],Long time favorite.  Shame to see so many people up there now though.
13,2018-03-30,['hiking'],There are 2 trails. One that is wide and one that is more for hiking. They both go back a good ways. I only saw 3 bikers today and they were respectful of hikers. It was an enjoyable hike. Not too hard. I would definitely do it again.
14,2018-01-15,[''],Way to many people at all times
15,2017-09-13,['hiking'],Awesome workout
16,2017-06-21,['hiking'],"This trail is fairly easy, and it starts getting really pretty a few miles in from the trailhead. I would recommend driving farther up the road and starting the instead of at the initial trailhead."
17,2017-06-19,[''],It's a great easy trail for a little family and some dogs.
18,2017-06-05,['hiking'],"Loved it, easy trail.  Beware of lots of mountain bikers."
19,2017-06-04,[''],"Hiked today (on a Saturday) and there were 30, yes 30 cars in the parking lot.  I about got ran into multiple times by out of control bikers coming down.  Several yelled profanities at me for having my dogs with me.  I'll never go back.  I'll stick to providence canyon.  So much better."
20,2017-05-27,[''],Good trail for the family
21,2017-05-21,['mountain biking'],Perfect trail. The further you go the more fun it gets.
22,2017-04-08,['trail running'],Lots and lots of new snow.
23,2016-09-18,[''],Awesome trail. Watch out for hikers the downhill is worth it.
24,2016-08-31,['hiking'],"nice easy trail, good amount of shade. dog friendly. some annoying flies. not steep"
25,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"Not the best hike by any means. If you hike the bike trail, you get run over constantly. If you hike in the road, you get to breathe dirt every time a car drives by. If this is what you are looking for, then it's the perfect hike for you!"
26,2016-05-30,['mountain biking'],"Great place for beginner mountain bikers to get used to single track, and the few added features make it fun for everyone."
27,2016-05-25,['hiking'],"Simple, easy, hike.  The view of the canyon isn't immediately noticed, but it is exceptional.  Not so much a hike as a simple stroll.  LOTS of snakes.  Keep your eyes open for Great Basin Rattle Snakes.  Leave them alone and they'll leave you alone."
28,2015-05-15,['trail running'],"Great single track trail. Used mostly for mountain biking, so if you are trail running, you'll want to be careful. Not many good views, but the trail itself is fun and well maintained."
29,2013-05-30,['hiking'],Very nice single track trail. Great for mountain biking but watch out for hikers and runners on the trails.
30,2012-12-06,['mountain biking'],"very fun trail on a bike, can be shuttled to the top.  uphill isn't bad even on my DH bike, i usually ride the road up to keep the trail open to people going down.  Has a couple fun jumps in the creek crossings, someone has made a couple rock obstacles on the sides of the trail to have fun on. one leads straight into some trees."
