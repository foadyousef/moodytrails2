0,2019-08-26,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']","I parked at the North Ogden Divide trail head. My
Strava tracked 12 miles for this hike. Really nice in the early morning. Very windy at the top. This trail does share with dirt bikes so be aware. Pretty rocky and wouldn’t recommend it for dogs unless they have boots. Pack in your own water as well, there is none on the trail. Panoramas are incredible and there is a nice little camp spot 2.2 miles in that would be awesome at night for stargazing. "
1,2019-08-19,[''],"Good and well defined. Incredible views of cities below and mountain ranges. Most oof this trail is loose shale and rock. Tough on a dogs peds. Fit them for boots to protect their feet and they’ll do fine. Watch out for motorcycles and mtn bikes.  There was a report of a 4’ long rattlesnake, but I didn’t see or hear anything. "
2,2019-08-17,['hiking'],dusty but no bugs.  
3,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Lots of flying bugs, including bees. If you’re highly allergic, carry your epi pen! Otherwise, I loved the trail. I’d say moderate is accurate for the distance and elevation gain (the gain is cut significantly if you don’t take the trail over every bump and instead take the tracks around). Wildflowers abound, especially around those hills! The end bit of the loop around the peak is way overgrown, at the last ten meters you’ll think you’ve lost the trail completely and then *poof* magically it rejoins the trail. Saw a few other hikers, mountain bikers, and dirt bikers. Not too crowded on a hot Sunday. Enjoyed the views of Mt. Ogden and Benny from here, as well as an angle on Ogden I hadn’t seen before. Took me about five hours round trip and I was in no hurry, stopping often to take in the views (and the breezes!)"

5,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade', 'rocky']","IMO, this trail should be rated as hard. Lots of gravel throughout making the decline slower on a steep trail. Went in mid-June, and the bugs were relentless in parts, especially in tree/shaded areas (beginning, and close towards the end). We saw lots of dirt bikers, which was annoying as we had to keep moving out of the way for them. Aside from that, the views make it all worthwhile!! Being native to the area, I can't believe it took me this long to get up on this trail. Definitely more challenging than we expected, as again the trail is rated as ""Moderate."" Would definitely like to go again in the fall. "
6,2019-04-19,['hiking'],"Took a stroll up here Thursday afternoon.  Weather was perfect, slight breeze on ridge.  The dog had to hit a small patch of snow off the East side, but after that he was ready to hike a little more.  Trail work being done on low half of mountain."

8,2019-02-23,['snowshoeing'],Cold windy cloudy beautiful day to snowshoe to Lewis peak!
9,2018-09-25,[''],"the views were amazing, though the incline made it a tad harder than moderate, plus.the distance. worth it though!"
10,2018-09-15,['hiking'],"One of my first hikes in Utah and it was a beauty! Fall colors are starting to appear. We went early, as much of the trail is exposed, and I was glad we did. Nice breeze!"
11,2018-09-08,['hiking'],"Did this as a hike/run, fall is a great time to go for some great views of fall colors. Go early as the majority of the trail is exposed. First 1 1/2 miles are a beast!"
12,2018-08-04,['hiking'],Amazing sights everywhere. The beginning is quite steep but becomes a little more moderate and easy for the last miles. Some marking were a little unclear but the path was relatively well kept. The second half is almost fully exposed but there is a little shade.
13,2018-07-15,['backpacking'],"Great trail, lots of shade.  Only got to the first shoulder. Pressed for time.  About 5 miles."
14,2018-07-12,['trail running'],Beautiful hike through dense forest followers by open ridge  trails with views in every direction.
15,2018-07-02,['hiking'],"The hike is beautiful. It provides sections with shade and many others with great views of the Ogden Valley, Ben Lomond Peak, Pineview Reservoir, Ogden Peak, and Ogden Canyon. It is somewhat steep at times but not terribly difficult. The smell of horse mint and other plants is so refreshing.  There is no water on the trail. Bikers and dirt bikes also use the trail so keep an eye out."
16,2018-06-24,[''],"This is one of my favorite hikes. If you can just make it past the initial switchbacks, then you’ll probably be fine. After that, there are some lesser uphill climbs (there are routes around some of them, if you want to skip some!of the uphill portions), but it’s generally a very moderate hike with great sight lines all along the trail. This trail in my experience tends to be a busy one and it also allows motorcycles, of which there were more than 10 that passed me on my last hike."
17,2018-06-12,['hiking'],"During the Spring the initial north face switch back elevation climb is through dence vegatation including oak brush and spruce trees.  The trail starts with a very cool single track and even at times a shady tunnel effect as you climb upwards.  There is a small spring coming down one of the switchback turns.  A good place to rest in the shade if you need it.

Finally, you come to the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and after passing a giant spruce tree the trail opens up and now you're exposed to the sunlight and drier sagebrush.  In the late Spring you'll find lots of colorful wildflowers with the  panoramic views of the Great Salt Lake, Ogden Valley, Mount Ogden and Ben Lomond.

When you reach the posted sign: Lewis Peak 3 mi North Ogden Divide TH 2 1/2 mi the trail will divide a few times on your way to Lewis Peak.  You may either climb the small peaks along the way to enjoy the panoramic views or you can save your energy and skirt around them.  In either case you won't be disappointed.

After two miles of gentle up and down changes in grade you'll come to the  final ascent through a hillside covered in quake and aspen.  Again the top of Lewis Peak is exposed.  So, hopefully your wearing a hat, you put on your Sport 50 SPF, brought at least a liter of water, a snack and a extra pair of dry socks.  After taking in the views, it's time for the 5.2 mile trek back.

It's a mostly downhill from now on and so you might feel those blisters start to  develope.  The wind can pick up in the afternoon, it might not be a bad idea to carry a light shell in your small pack.

In the winter, after a fresh snowfall, I love to snowshoe this trail."
18,2018-06-02,['hiking'],"Did this yesterday.  Almost turned back about 1.5 miles in  because I ran into very low, dark fog, but I waited it out for about 10 minutes and the sun started breaking it up.  Glad I didn’t quit because it was a great hike, great views, and nothing dangerous (like real narrow edges over a steep cliff, etc).   The only “bad” thing is there are some steep rolling hills between about the 3rd and 4th mile, which means the return trip isn’t “all down hill” right away.  I think it will be great to do again in fall."
19,2018-05-20,['hiking'],"Panoramic view of ogden valley. Very steep but fun and more than moderate IMO
Can be muddy.  Pretty narrow.  Don’t enjoy bringing the dogs here. Much better dog trails. Some shade. Loose rocks and divits from horses can be hindering."
20,2018-05-09,['off road driving'],Incredible ride you can access from  Pineview or Ogden Canyon. The switchbacks going up from Ogden Canyon can get pretty rough and requires some skill to get up. Hikers keep in mind this is a Dirt-Bike trail please step aside and let motos pass. Riders keep your speeds down around blind corners!
21,2018-04-24,['hiking'],Nice hike with spectacular views.  Very narrow in parts and can be muddy which sucks going down.
22,2018-03-27,['snowshoeing'],"A great hike all year round.  I especially enjoy snowshoeing on this trail.  There is enough elevation gain at a gradual grade, that makes for a good cardio workout.  I always bring at least a liter of water, wear sunglasses, head covering and I pack a snack and a light weight shell to protect from the wind.

The switchbacks are shaded, but the summit is exposed to the sun and wind.  Excellent 360 degree panoramic views of Ogden Valley,  Mt. Ogden, Ben Lomond and the Great Salt Lake."
23,2018-02-12,['hiking'],"Snow packed and ice covered trails. Ice trekkers are a must right now on the trail. I only went to were South Skyline Trail loops, then the snow wasn’t packed down and snowshoes were needed. 

This trail is quite the hike up and has beautiful views."
24,2017-11-26,['hiking'],Didn't see a soul. The last quarter mile was a bit icy. Def recommend
25,2017-09-08,['hiking'],Took a lot of rest stops but was worth it. It is a well maintained trail.
26,2017-08-20,['hiking'],The trail has very nice views of Eden. The trail is very steep and exhausting until you get to where it flattens out. It was not busy when we went on a Saturday around 10am.
27,2017-08-18,['hiking'],One of my new favorites. The first two miles are tough both way. But the incline is not terrible after that! Beware of rattlesnakes in the summer months!
28,2017-08-04,[''],Definitely a harder moderate route... ha. Beautiful trail. Fun. Takes about 2 hours each way.
29,2017-06-16,['hiking'],
30,2016-10-17,['hiking'],"Great well maintained trail, except when i went, all the signage was down. I hiked part of the way with someone from out of town, and when she was jogging back she ended up on the trail to Pineview and went a couple miles before realizing it due to the missing sign. Other than that, trails were in good condition, nothing washed out or dangerous, and easy to follow as long as you don't mind going uphill and know which way to turn."
