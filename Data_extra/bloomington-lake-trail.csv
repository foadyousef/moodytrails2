0,2019-08-29,['hiking'],This was a really easy hike in. I carried my paddle board in and had no trouble at all. Definitely would recommend!
1,2019-08-13,['hiking'],"The views are amazing, easy for the whole family! "
2,2019-08-09,['hiking'],"lovely stroll.   wild flowers in bloom.  lots of people.  there is a day use fee box, $5 per vehicle including ATV. "
3,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"Amazing beautiful series of lakes clear up high :) we loved it as did our doodle pups. Wildflowers are in full bloom and road up was tons easier driving to get in the razor. We were the only ones there from 9am to but by 11am a gazillion people showed up. Go early! 
Must do rope swing. "
4,2019-07-21,['hiking'],"Okay, the real challenge here is not the trail itself, but the road to get up there.
This loong dirt road gets bumpy and quite narrow sometimes and there is quite a lot of traffic.
Drive slow, watch for incomong cars and get a good 4WD SUV.  

Though, this is a pretty nice little family trail, with two very nice lakes !

Bring your bathing suit!"
5,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'rocky']","We hiked this on 7/11, you can park at the trailhead now, it's not blocked by snow. Lots of wildflowers on the drive and hiking up. Rope swing worth trying. very short and easy hike. "
6,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"We went early in the morning, beautiful and quiet! It is an easy hike, we were able to do it in our sandals! For those that want to do it, I recommend getting your feet wet, and to go before noon because that’s when a lot of people start showing up! "
7,2019-06-24,"['hiking', 'snow']","Great hike! Right now the gate to get to the trail head is closed. It’s about 2.5-3.0 mile hike from the gate to the trail head. When you get to the trail head there is snow! Right now you hike in the snow pretty much from the trail head to the lake. Super pretty! It was a great hike, but I’m sure there would be less snow if any in late July/August! "
8,2018-10-07,['rock climbing'],"always a great time in this beautiful little spot of serenity and fun. little bit of every thing; hiking, rock climbing, swimming, rope swinging into the lake, Cliff diving, camping."
9,2018-09-24,[''],"my husband and I went a few years ago and loved it!  it is such a beautiful place. However, I remember the road being horrible. is it bad right now?  I would like to take my minivan if I can, instead of my truck."
10,2018-09-22,['hiking'],"This was a fun family hike and the lake is beautiful, nestled in a canyon bowl."
11,2018-09-07,[''],Fun and beautiful
12,2018-09-04,[''],it was amazing
13,2018-08-18,[''],I've been want to go for sometime. It was mich more than I expected. view was great. kids loved the rope swing.
14,2018-08-17,[''],"Breathtaking scenery, easy trail. Not a lot of shade. Glacier lake at the end with a rope swing if you dare!"
15,2018-08-13,['hiking'],This is a fun hike for the entire family.
16,2018-08-09,['hiking'],Loved this hike!!! The lake was so much fun!
17,2018-08-04,['hiking'],Very easy trail. Bloomington Lake is very beautiful. Lot of people at the lake but what a beautiful little setting. 
18,2018-08-03,[''],"The lake is 5 star pretty! The trail is hammered out, wide enough to drive a bus down. Don't hike here if you want a quiet place, more of a high school swimming hole. Probably would not go back."
19,2018-07-31,[''],Super easy hike and the lake is refreshing to swim in. My kids enjoyed seeing the fish and my daughter loved all of the flowers along the trail.
20,2018-07-17,[''],gorgeous
21,2018-07-10,['hiking'],Absolutely beautiful! It's an easy hike but if it's hot it can be a little difficult going back. It was worth it though. so beautiful! would definitely go back!
22,2018-06-28,[''],"Such a beautiful place! There are two ponds you pass on the way which are gorgeous as well! We went paddle boarding, cliff jumping, and they even have a rope swing! If you don’t want to get in the water that’s ok because the view is worth it! Great for all ages! The trail was easy to get to and the gate is now opened! So it is a pretty short hike!"
23,2018-06-11,[''],"Just made this hike yesterday. The snow has melted from the road up, but the gate was still locked. Added at least two miles to the hike, maybe closer to three. There shouldn't be too many bugs, though; I think my girlfriend ate most of them on the trip back down."
24,2018-05-26,[''],As of today the trail is still buried under feet of snow. You aren’t able to continue up the road past 1045. The ground is super muddy and again buried under feet of snow.
25,2017-09-05,['hiking'],"Trail was very crowded today (Sunday before Labor Day). Parking lot was full, overflow was full, and all the large trucks passing each other on the narrow road was a little sketchy. Love the trail though - been up here a few times, and it never disappoints."
26,2017-08-17,['hiking'],Was there 8/15/17. It is a short easy hike.  Quite busy with families camping and swimming. Bring swimming clothes so you can do the rope swing. The road getting to the trailhead was a little rough and narrow in some spots but fine otherwise.
27,2017-08-07,['hiking'],"We hiked this today!!! Very heavily trafficked, even for a Sunday, but a fairly easy hike! Beautiful scenery. Lots of people jumping off the rope swing!!!"
28,2017-07-24,['hiking'],"Drove up there yesterday (7-23-2017) from bear lake and the roads were fine, I saw a honda civic that drove up there. Looks like some fresh gravel had been spread out in areas.

Id definitely re visit this area, tons of flowers along the trails, very cool!"
29,2017-07-23,['hiking'],Was up there this week (7/21/17) and the road was not washed out. Beautiful (and cold) lake!
30,2017-07-19,['hiking'],"Anna Price, how was the trail this week when you went?  Maggie said it was washed out.  Planning a trip there for next week so would love to know if trail is still washed out."
31,2017-07-18,[''],Love this hike! Beautiful lake is worth it.
32,2017-07-15,['hiking'],"Not a long hike, but very beautiful. The rope swing is awesome, but that water is frigid. On the opposite side of the lake you could ride a tube right into the lake the snow still comes right down to the water in July."
33,2017-07-13,[''],"Gorgeous! However THE ROAD IS WASHED OUT (7/13/17) we had to shuttle our family reunion 30 mins to the trailhead with our taller vehicles. By the time we left at the end of the day, the road was ""CLOSED"". We had to push one vehicle out of the river. If you are planning on hook summer of 2017, check to see if the road has been fixed or make sure you are in a tall truck with 4 wheel drive just in case. I can only imagine how bad it will be in a couple weeks."
34,2017-07-11,[''],Awesome! We go every year
35,2017-06-24,[''],We were there a week ago and there was so much snow that we couldn't find the trail. But it sure was beautiful wandering around the snow packed mountain!
36,2017-06-23,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! Still a good amount of snow on the trail and we had to park 0.1 miles from the trailhead because there was still a ten foot patch of snow on the road. Rope swing is up and very fun even if you just swing and don't drop into the ice covered water. Warning: part of the road is washed out but passable in a taller car. We were fine in a minivan but some in our group turned back.
37,2017-06-05,[''],"Just a fair warning, went on this hike June 2 and there is still a lot of snow which makes the trail non-existent. Also, the road is still snow covered, making it more like a 5 mile hike instead of 1.5. Not too hard to find the lakes (just head toward the mountains to the left/north) but it's fairly difficult finding your way back because of the snow. Got lost for a couple hours because we couldn't follow our tracks back (they melt so fast). Wouldn't recommend it now, but I bet it's amazing once the snow melts"
38,2017-02-09,[''],Great hike! It was perfect for our family outing. Beautiful scenery!
39,2017-02-04,['hiking'],Nice hike for little children and family picnic.
40,2016-10-06,['hiking'],"This is an easy hike, suitable for families with small kids. With the exception of one steep part of the road, it is an easy drive from Willow Flats Campground. I spent many summer days and nights as a boy, camping and hiking in this area. The air is fresh, and the water is incredibly clean and cold."
41,2016-08-09,['hiking'],Short hike. Very pretty and lots of wildflowers.
42,2016-07-30,[''],Love this but the water is FREEZING!!
43,2016-07-18,['hiking'],This is a great short family hike! During the warmer months take your swim trunks and hop on in! The rope swing was there and looked like a blast!
44,2016-07-12,['hiking'],"Definitely echo what another commenter recently posted, it's so easy to get to that it's a little mixed bag on the people you encounter. The disaffected skater crowd, Boy Scouts, family reunion crowd were all represented today, but... the lake and scenery are stunning.  It's well worth a few hours. And, if you get there early enough, the crowds will be light. Pack a swim suit and towel, a Bloomington Lake plunge from the rope swing is mandatory (or should be)."
45,2016-07-11,['snowshoeing'],nice place... busy place summer weekends.
46,2016-06-26,[''],"This hike was nice but it's so easy access that you get all sorts of people up there. We encountered some drunk teenagers and many dogs not on leashes.
We took our dogs but had to leave before we really wanted too because of the leash problem. So if you do want to bring your dog, PLEASE obey the rules and keep them on a leash. It's not fair to the rest of us. 
It probably would be an exceptional place to go in the non-tourist months before it snows and shortly after the Forest Service opens the gate."
47,2016-06-23,['hiking'],Gorgeous spot for swimming. Easy hike for all skill levels with a huge reward at the end.
48,2016-06-06,['hiking'],Leisurely hike.. Very kid friendly.
49,2015-08-24,['hiking'],"Great hike with kids. The drive in the dirt up takes about 35 minutes, but worth it. The lake is beautiful and the rope swing looked awesome. The line was very long so we didn't get the chance...next time!"
50,2015-08-20,[''],Great hike! Gorgeous scenery!
51,2015-07-24,['hiking'],Amazing hike. The hike is short and easy and the scenery is stunning. Cliff jumping and rope swing at the lake. The dirt road is kind of an investment but totally worth it.
52,2015-07-10,['hiking'],A small but steep hill right of the parking lot was the only moderate portion. The lake is beautiful and the rope swing was awesome.
53,2015-06-19,['hiking'],"It was a beautiful scene. The road up to the trail was in good condition. I made it up the 10 mile gravel road in a pt cruiser. The hike was short, with one or two steep sections, but it was fairly easy. Definitely a beautiful scene. The water was cold, but the hot sun made the dip in the glacier fed lake fairly comfortable. It was beautiful and would recommend it to anybody who is able."
54,2015-04-09,['hiking'],Although this is a very short hike it's one of the most beautiful places we've seen. Definitely worth the drive out and the perfect place for a picnic.
55,2012-07-01,['hiking'],its a nice hike.
56,2012-02-28,['hiking'],"I love this hike.  Although short, the lake is a beautiful scene.  Short enough hike that my young children had little difficulty.  If you are daring bring your swim suit and go off the rope swing that is occasionally there.  Be warned that the lake is extremely cold."
57,2011-08-12,['hiking'],The hike was easy but the lake is beautiful!!!! Great quick hike!
