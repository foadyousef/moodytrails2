0,2019-08-27,['hiking'],"Loved this hike.  78 degrees.  Loose rocks, a steady climb and a couple of water crossing to pick your way across.  We only saw one other person this morning.  Made it to the mine before we had to turn around.  Some wildflowers still to enjoy. The starting point wasn't as intuitive as we thought.  Roughly 6.1 miles into BCC between Rock House and Mineral Slab snow avalanche areas on the south side of the road.  There is a gate you can walk around and the trailhead sign is down the dirt road.  Defiantly worth it."
1,2019-08-21,['hiking'],Never steep.  Lots of loose rock. 
2,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"The trail is very rocky and reasonably steep.  Make certain to wear shoes with good support.  The wildflowers were still in full bloom today, surprising!  Beautiful cirque.  Made it halfway to the ridge from the trail, but it was too slippery and steep.  Turned around.  The weather was perfect today."
3,2019-08-17,['hiking'],Re-hiked today. The last 3 time I've snowshoed and haven't be able to get to the upper basin until today.

5,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Rockiest trail ever!
6,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"Steady incline with lots of loose rocks. Enjoyable hike but definitely a workout! View at the top is beautiful. Note, there’s a pretty steep rock climb to get from the “summit” to the top of the ridge line. "
7,2019-07-13,['hiking'],trail is in great shape until mile 3.6.  still some snow and ice near top
8,2019-07-08,['hiking'],"Great trail, still snow at the top, the snow is pretty hard so you can walk on top of it with some waterproof boots. Made it to the top of the ridge and was rewarded with some nice views as far as I could see in each direction. I did have a couple falls so be careful or just wait a couple more weeks for the snow to melt. "
9,2019-07-06,['hiking'],"Ice and snow still at the top.  Fell on snow field with cleats and lost my ice axe in the fall.   dislocated shoulder and helicopter ride out.   if you find my ice ax, would be cool to get it back. "
10,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","This trail is amazing! Great views, pine trees and aspens and wildlife oh my! I had to turn around at 2.5 miles there was a lot of snow from an avalanche. I will definitely be coming back in late summer to go the whole distance. Ran into a moose and a deer."
11,2019-05-15,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'scramble', 'snow']",Avalanche warning near the top! be careful - posted 15.05.19

13,2019-03-16,['hiking'],One of the steeper trails if you want a harder workout.
14,2019-01-07,['hiking'],"I'm going to re-review this trail when the snow melts. Overall a good hike. I used my micros pikes to about 2.5 miles in. From there you will need snowshoes to keep going. I did find some of the cross country skiers on this trail rude. Others were very nice, just be ready to keep an eye on your back if your on feet. Lots of animal tracks from various mountain creatures found in the snow."
15,2018-12-31,['snowshoeing'],Trail is in great shape for skis and snowshoes.
16,2018-11-05,['hiking'],I liked this trail a lot. It is pretty rocky in some areas but not any big deal. There’s a lot of snow once you reach 9k feet and not being into postholing and wet socks I turned back. The old mine is pretty cool. Lots of water available all along the route if you filter. I’ll definitely be back to complete this one.
17,2018-09-29,['hiking'],"For me, this was a difficult trail.  Not necessarily because of the length or climb, but because of the trail surface.  Most of this trail, I estimate 60-70%, is extremely rocky.  The footing is slippery and treacherous.  There is a base of 2 to 3 inches of fine pea gravel.  Sometimes you're walking on that and it's like walking on the beach.  Other times there is a layer of softball to football sized rocks on top of the pea gravel.  You can turn an ankle if you're not careful.  Frankly, I got sick of it.  It was extremely slow going because of this.

The trail is a steady uphill to the top and then the last half-mile or so the grade increases.  Then the trail ends at the base of the cliff and you have to scramble about 100 feet or so up and over the rocks on a grade that is about a 60 degree angle.  For me it was a notch or two short of needing a rope.  It's pretty dangerous.

But the views are great, it's a very pretty canyon.   I saw no other hikers, but about half way down three motorized mountain bikers came up.  There was a dead animal carcass about two thirds of the way up where the creek joins the trail.  It looks like it's been dead there a week or two.  I couldn't tell what it was.

At the very top there were animal tracks.  Whatever has three toes and is hooved.  I assume a mountain goat but I never saw anything."
18,2018-07-01,[''],"Nice trail.  Some wet parts at beginning near waterfalls, which were quite pretty.  Started at 1pm on a Sun and encountered few hikers or dirt bikes."
19,2018-07-01,['trail running'],"Pretty trail.  Scrambled to top of ridge line between Mineral Fork and Mill B Saturday morning.  Amazing view.  Don’t get hit in the face by a rock!  Went early, started at 5:30am.  Motorized dirt bikers seem to wake up around 9:30am/10am.  They Were filling up trail as we were exiting around 11.  Some dirt bikers with dork status seem to have dirt for brains and pay little attention at beginning point of trail, almost drove my buddy over.  Saw some mountain goats at end of trail, that was great."
20,2018-06-23,[''],Beautiful trail and only 3 other hikers spotted on a Friday.
21,2018-03-24,['snowshoeing'],Tried to get up to the Silver Mountain Mine on snowshoes but the snow stopped us. Will try again sometime when the snow is gone
22,2017-07-16,['hiking'],
23,2017-07-06,[''],As of May this trail is closed
24,2016-08-08,['hiking'],Long and hard but worth it.  Trail is wide and easily followed.  It can get a little hairy at times though as the best way to describe it is that it is like walking through a dried up creek bed.  Lots of large loose rocks.  Switchbacks towards the top aren't too steep though there is lots of loose shale.  Views from the top mine location are spectacular.  Even saw some mountain goats on the cliffs at the top.  I tracked the trip down and it was closer to 6 miles from the top to the road.  I would say the whole trail there and back is just under 12 miles.
25,2016-08-08,[''],The trail is closer to 5.8 up so total is closer to 12 miles in and out. longer than expected but great one.
26,2016-05-29,['hiking'],"lovely spring day, we went 2.5 miles up, occasionally in 1-2 inch deep water, glad for poles. as you get toward the mine, there is snow up to the ridgeline. Aspen starting to green up. next time I will bring my water filter since so much available."
27,2016-05-15,['hiking'],Still heaps of snow pack the further up you get. It was all good till I got to a point about 1.5 miles up that had deep snow with what was essentially a small stream running under it.
28,2016-01-09,['hiking'],Great hike. Started at 7 and hiked by headlamp for  the first hour. Trail was well packed with a couple of inches of new snow. Hiked to Wasatch mine just as the clouds started breaking up and saw some blue sky. Didn't see anyone on the trail until we started clown. Then it was a steady stream of people.
29,2015-10-09,[''],"Rocky trail, but about 3/4 mile up the creek actually went down the trail a bit. It's worth wading through it to get so a very cool waterfall. Some spots might be a bit much for kids. Mostly easy with a couple moderate areas. Loved it!"
30,2015-09-24,['hiking'],"This was a really nice fall hike. Long and steep, but the trail has some level spots which is great for relaxing for a short minute or two. This trail is up there on my favorites list due to the views and the lack of people (unlike Mill B/Lake Blanch Trail). We also saw some Mountain Goats at the top.. made it worth it."
31,2015-08-25,['off road driving'],Great trail. Very rocky and technical. Can't wait to do it on a bike
32,2014-10-05,['hiking'],"Mineral Fork is rich in the history of the Wasatch. As with many other canyons (tributary) in the Cottonwoods, there is a lot of evidence of obvious mine activity from another part of time. Mineral Fork has two notable mine ruins, the Wasatch mine and the Regulator Johnson mine. The former was clearly more successful with the foundation of the dormitory/hotel/office left behind from the old days. The waste rock is fairly substantial. The tunnel is barred. The curious mine bends to know what happened there.

The latter was a high - altitude mine camp that looks as though more energy and time were spent getting to the site than in actual time and effort digging. The remnants of the old truck torn apart to form the winch to haul ore carts forth from the depths of the earth still tells a bit of the tail. Truth is, even much of what what here has been scattered by wind, snow, and avalanche.

The trails are shared with ATVs and dirtbikes. Everyone is quite courteous. But the best time up here is winter when you have your touring skis on."
33,2014-06-10,['hiking'],"An intermediate hike that reaps rewards with overflowing streams onto the trails, cascading waterfalls, and a semi-clear rocky path all the up to the snow laden bowl. Bring plenty of water! :)"
34,2013-07-02,['hiking'],"If you're adventurous, don't mind sharing a trail (narrow road) with motorcycles, ATV's, mountain bikes, and have a great appreciation for spectacular views? Do this! The hike to Wasatch Mine is comparable to Lake Blanche, however, those wanting to continue on to Regulator Johnson Mine be prepared for a very steep climb. If you get that far, do not head back down without making the 200' scramble to the ridge top, the view is worth every punishing step. Also, water water water, I took 4 liters and easily drank it all. GREAT HIKE!"
