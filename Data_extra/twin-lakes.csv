0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],This place is quiet and beautiful steep but worth it. 
1,2019-09-06,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike most of the way, and then you get to the actual lake itself, and there's a great big dam there marring the view."
2,2019-09-04,['hiking'],fantastic hike.  got to see a moose with baby in the lake at the top. worth the effort!
3,2019-09-04,['hiking'],I started at silver lake and decided to continue up to twin lakes. Parts near the top were tough for me - lots of rocks and elevation gain. But worth it! Gorgeous up at the twin lakes and I was able to see a momma moose and her calf in the lake. I’m not a regular hiker so probably easier for those that hike regularly!
4,2019-09-03,['hiking'],Beautiful alpine lake.  Hike up the trial alongside it for best views; it’s most impressive from above.  Lots of ski signs and some ski lifts make it feel less remote and natural than other alpine lakes in the area. 
5,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Amazing aspens and wild flowers throughout. Many chipmunks, squirrels and bumblebees. Nice and shady at around 5pm."

7,2019-09-01,['hiking'],"Very cool trail. Starts in a very crowded Silver Lake loop. End of August still had a great array of wild flowers. It was 100 degrees in the valley but only low 80’s up top so it was quite bearable even mid day. There was a bit of shade but not much. The lake at the top has other trails to explore. In a few days this hike I’ll have a ton of color with the trees changing. Should be a great show. We also saw a moose at the bottom at Silver Lake loop, who was hurriedly trying to criss the marsh because there were so many people around."

9,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"a little steep and a bit rocky, but the lake is beautiful. the walk past Silver Lake was easy and a nice way to start it. I looped it up with the Sister Lakes and Dog Lake. not too strenuous, but this was a good way to start. got most of the elevation out of the way early. might not be great for little kids since it's steep, but it's short."
10,2019-08-20,['hiking'],steep at places but worth the hike up to the lake. Twin Lake is very beautiful and peaceful. We spent a few hours up at the lake enjoying the peace and quiet.  
11,2019-08-15,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",
12,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","quite Rocky, but lots of summer wildflowers! take breaks after each scramble and you'll knock it out in no time."
13,2019-08-08,['hiking'],Perfect trail for out-of-town family and friends! Still some wildflowers too! 
14,2019-08-07,['hiking'],The wildflowers on this hike (in August) were beautiful!  The hike starts on the flat loop trail that goes around Silver Lake and goes into rapid ascent from there. 
15,2019-08-06,['hiking'],"This trail is pretty steep actually. I recommend doing the whole Brighton Lakes Loop if you can, "
16,2019-08-06,"['hiking', 'rocky']",beautiful but the trailhead is EXTREMELY crowded. pretty view at the lake though 
17,2019-07-19,['hiking'],It’s a fun hike. 
18,2019-07-18,[''],"Most of the trail is just going up. The first mile isn’t so bad, the trail is pretty clear & leveled. It gets really steep closer to the lake. One path has a lot of rocky terrain but there’s an easier trail next to it that can be used to avoid the rocks. I was definitely dying a lot in the steeper areas but a lot of breaks helped. It was shady for most of the part & a lot of logs/rocks to rest on. There were a lot of mosquitoes, so I’d suggest repellent. Overall, the hike was worth it. The lake was beautiful. "
19,2019-07-17,['hiking'],"Steep, but lovely! "
20,2019-07-16,['hiking'],"I must not be as resilient at 49 years old as 4 years old because this wasn't an easy hike for me. The trail is accessed off the ""Solitude Lake Trail"" which is a tourist attraction and can be very busy. About the first mile is easy, a little rocky and with a gentle incline that wraps around the mountain. The scenery is breathtaking, and then the steep incline over rocks is breathtaking, and not in a good way. I would say this section, that is about .70 miles of the trail is difficult, especially in the afternoon sun. Thankfully there was some shade and big rocks to take a rest on. Once over the top, near the lake, it levels out and is beautiful. This is a hike worth doing.   "
21,2019-07-15,['hiking'],"Beautiful and fun for kids! A little rocky, but my 3 and 5 year old did it with a little hand holding! "
22,2019-07-13,['hiking'],Nice easy hike for kids. If your getting baked in the valley heat and want a quick escape than this place is for you. 
23,2019-07-11,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']","Great hike, had the lake all to myself. Started around 5:00, had mostly shade all the way to the top. Lots of bugs and was not prepared with repellent this time."
24,2019-07-08,"['fishing', 'bugs', 'rocky']","was a fun hike to the top. Did this July 4th and it was great as not a lot of people continued past silver lake. This is a steep climb on rocky terrain, but the lake is worth it. take a hammock and fishing pole to enjoy for hours."
25,2019-06-30,['hiking'],Quick hike. steep at times.
26,2019-06-25,"['hiking', 'snow']",Lake was still 70% frozen as of 6/24. Trail has spots of snow but you can navigate around it for the most part. Definitely wouldn’t go in regular sneakers. Hiking shoes and a pole made it OK in snowy spots. With the warm weather this week the lake should melt pretty quick. 
27,2019-06-24,['hiking'],"The last half-mile was a wall of snow, so we had to work our way around it to the lake. (Also still in tons of snow—spikes were needed to get my 6-year-old up there). We downloaded the trail map, but as long as you keep going UP and stay near the brook, you’ll find it. "
28,2019-06-16,"['hiking', 'snow']",Still lots of snow on the trail. You can't see the trail much of the way so make sure you've downloaded the map. Spikes not needed but poles were helpful.
29,2019-05-18,['hiking'],
30,2018-10-20,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike.  Packed snow and Ice, super slippery, micro spikes needed.  Oct 19."
31,2018-10-13,['surfing'],Hello twins. ;)
32,2018-10-11,['hiking'],"This is an easy hike. Really cool, because easy and good views. Straight forward, but heavily trafficked."
33,2018-09-29,['hiking'],Challenging climb with elevation and sections of rock trail. Completely worth it for the beautiful views! #doinghardthings
34,2018-09-29,['hiking'],I really liked this hike.   The fall colors right now are really coming out...alot of yellow.   I extended the hike by taking a short side path to the left that led to a really nice overlook of silver lake.  I also walked around Twin Lakes after I got up there.  Another cool thing that happened is that on my way back after you get to the boardwalk again I saw my first moose.  She was hanging out just to the side of the trail munching on leaves.  Very scenic trail especially during this time of year.   Give it a shot.
35,2018-09-09,['hiking'],"Beautiful! We did a 2.8 mile loop. Started at the base of Milly up to Twin Lakes. Then hiked back down to Silver Lake and up the road back to Brighton. Steep, but worth it!"
36,2018-09-08,['hiking'],"We did the shorter version of this hike. (You can start at Milly Lift) The trail is STEEP, but easy enough when it comes to footing. The true gem is when you get to Twin Lake. It's like stepping into a Thomas Kinkade painting. The water is glassy and the trees and foliage make this place a true Haven. If you're a true trooper you'll top it off by jumping in the Lake. Be warned: it's VERY cold."
37,2018-09-06,[''],Nice hike. Twin lake located within solitude ski area
38,2018-09-02,[''],I really enjoy this trail and almost always see moose down at the base by Silver Lake. It’s a great hike that my kids and I like to do every Summer. It’s pretty steep at some points but not too long and the lake is fun to hang out by and throw rocks in. One time my kids brought nets and caught tiny minnows. (Then release them).
39,2018-08-18,['hiking'],mosquitoes like I've never seen. no fishing either.
40,2018-08-14,['hiking'],"Pretty trail! Definitely moderate. Our 2 year old couldn't finish on his own, and our 6 year old made it but not without lots of complaining. Would definitely go back but not with small kids."
41,2018-08-13,['hiking'],"I'm totally out of shape. Never workout. This was a tough hike, but achievable. Done in a little over 2 hours. Would definitely recommend it!"
42,2018-08-10,['hiking'],"Definitely right on track with the moderate rating. I went with three kids, ages 11, 8 and 2. Good for kids except for a few rocky areas where its hard to get traction. Some decent shade in the middle of the day. The lake at the top is stunning. Watch out for squirrels stealing your food :) Bring plenty of water."
43,2018-08-07,[''],"Lost men’s gold wedding ring! If found, please email mullally5@yahoo.com
Thank you!"
44,2018-08-06,[''],Great views one of my favorites!
45,2018-07-31,[''],"This was a great hike, but be sure to wear shoes with good traction. It's rocky with a ton of loose gravel."
46,2018-07-29,[''],"Start this trail early, its very popular. Hike was nice even for people like me who aren't in shape. Views and lakes are beautiful, the only negative is the amount of big loose rocks on this trail."
47,2018-07-27,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! Great for families with kids that are used to hiking a bit. Bring bug spray 
48,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"This was our first hike of the season.  We are not in the best of shape, but the trail wasn't too bad.  It was busy at the base, but as you rose in elevation, the crowds thinned.  Great view from the top and a lovely reservoir. I have been skiing at Brighton, and in my youth hiked Brighton, so it was good to see what was underneath all the great snow. Perhaps it is getting too popular.  Not really, great to share great experiences."
49,2018-07-19,[''],"A forgotten +favorite!
Definitely family friendly, but not ""we just started hiking last week and this is our 3rd hike ever"" family friendly.
Took my 2, 4, and 5.5 year olds and made it round trip in about two and a half hours with the little one needing to be carried occasionally.
The first half is an ideal moderate hike, shaded with gorgeous pine and aspen and a well packed trail, the second half is more exposed with loose rocks as the trail and a fairly steep incline.
The gorgeous pristine lake is worth every step and I was SO impressed with how clean the trail and lake were...not a wrapper. Kudos to our fellow hikers for being responsible and packing out their trash!
I was a little turned off that the parking lot was overflowing and there were hundreds of people, but once we got off the silver lake trail and started towards Twin Lakes, we had very few people to share the trail with!"
50,2018-07-18,['hiking'],Fun hike! We were able to do this one with my 6 year old sister although the steeper parts were a little more difficult for her. Once we got to the top we all enjoyed hanging out around the lake. My family and I watched a guy catch a fairly large fish and we all applauded him. Definitely worth the effort to get up there!
51,2018-07-09,['hiking'],This hike is a quick get away.  The lake is beautiful and a great introduction to the area.  Steep but short.
52,2018-07-08,['hiking'],You are essentially walking on a gravel road between Twin Lakes and Solitude. Favorite part was from Solitude down where you weren’t exposed to the sun. On the way up to Twin there are great views of Silver Lake below.
53,2018-07-02,[''],"Great short hike, nice incline the whole way. Great spots to hang hammocks and relax."
54,2018-06-24,[''],"Really great quick hike! Started at about 8 and got to the top at 9, we took lots of stops as well. The trail was empty the whole way up. Gets pretty steep towards the top. Beautiful views. Coming back down the trail got pretty busy."
55,2018-06-23,['hiking'],"Short hike but the incline makes it moderately difficult.  The area around the lake is gorgeous no matter what time of the year you go.  made this hike on June 2, 2018 and the lake is still mostly iced over with snow on the far side of the lake measuring 13 inches in spots."
56,2018-06-21,['hiking'],"I haven't been out yet this year (work is cramping my style!) so I decided on a quick Father's Day hike to get the blood pumping. Went up to Twin Lakes, then over to Mary, Dog, then up to the top of the Crest Lift and back. Very little snow throughout, at least nothing to write home about at this point. Liked this trail well enough, although I think I'd prefer to go the Brighton-Mary-Twin route and back. Nice views, not very strenuous and a good way to kick my season off. Recommended for the whole family!"
57,2018-06-17,['hiking'],Challenging but fun hike. No snow and trail is dry. Great views of Silver Lake along the way makes you forget about the uphill climb.
58,2018-06-05,['hiking'],"Made it to Twin Lake fairly easily. Now getting across to go to Lake Mary was another story. We were able to get about half way across the Granite Lakes Trail connector and it turned to snow packed and we lost track of trail. Yes even with a GPS. It was covered in snow. We ended up going down one of the stream trails (ish) to the LDS Girls Camp and walking down from there. Heard that the top end at Lake Mary was snow packed and hard to find trails. Snow shoes, poles, and better marked trails. We still had a great time though."
59,2018-05-29,['hiking'],"I was just going to do Silver Lake and saw the sign for Twin lakes and seen that it was only a mile with 700 elevation gain so I thought I would have a go. It is mostly straight up but if you make frequent stops it is a fairly easy hike. On the way up I saw a Marmot and a Pika. (Near the area of the landslide) About 3/4 of the way up you start to run into snow. Which is slushy and the lake is still frozen with snow. Again, on a sunny day when the water is thawed I bet it is gorgeous to see the reflections. It was still pretty."
60,2017-11-27,['hiking'],"Actually we started with the intention of going to Lake Solitude, but went up the trail for Twin Lakes instead. We did this back in September of this year. We weren't sure how the snow would make the hiking experience different as we are new to hiking. We actually ended up liking hiking up in the snow as when there was no snow on the trail, it was a bit hard to traverse up on the trail on the stones, pebbles and boulders on the trail. It seemed in some parts of the trail there was up to a foot of snow. But, there were some sections that were a bit slushy or slippery, so walking sticks or the snow cleats may be helpful. I am quite a slow hiker, so going up took about 1 hr 45 min and about 50 minutes to go down."
61,2017-11-13,[''],"Beautiful hike with just enough snow right now. It's all pretty much uphill so it's a nice workout but not too challenging.

Seeing a frozen Silver Lake right at the beginning was an added bonus!"
62,2017-10-08,['bird watching'],a little bit of snow and ice patches to walk through to the dam but the trail covered with leaves is beautiful!
63,2017-09-29,['hiking'],Short and easy.  Peaceful!
64,2017-09-12,[''],Heavily trafficked is an understatement! But the lake and views is amazing.
65,2017-08-19,[''],"Definitely moderate. The entire stretch from Silver Lake to Twin Lake is uphill and rocky. Twin Lake itself isn't super big, but it has a beautiful view."
66,2017-08-19,['hiking'],"Started at Silver Lake, then on to Solitude Lake, then on to Twin Lakes for 3.8 miles in about an hour and a half moving time and 994 elevation change for these two 60-ish out of shape folks.  The climb down from Twin Lakes was less pleasant than the other 2.5 miles; we will just reverse next time.  Sights above Twin Lakes were great, the views and vistas between Twin Lakes and Solitude Lake awesome."
67,2017-08-16,[''],"Beautiful trail. Our group saw Moose, marmots and squirrels. Short hike, perfect for the shortening evenings of late summer. Altitude may bother you if you haven't hiked the are before. But nice, short, after-work challenge."
68,2017-08-13,['backpacking'],"Great trail, took the kids was a little tough towards the end but well worth it."
69,2017-07-30,[''],I would not call this an Easy trail.  It is STEEP for nearly the entire 1.2 miles in.  The wildflowers were spectacular though.
70,2017-07-29,['hiking'],Beautiful trail with many animals to see. I would rate it as Moderate (not easy) due to quite a few steep uphills.
71,2017-07-26,['hiking'],"Good easy trail and if you combine it with want of the peaks around it you can easily add to the challenge, easiest of them all is Mount Evergreen right next to the lake and dam but from close to the summit you will have a view of Solitude Lake on one side and Twin Lakes on the other! Happy trails"
72,2017-07-24,['hiking'],"We loved this hike. It's gorgeous with the mountainside full of wild flowers, beautiful pines and quakies. When we made it to the top to see Twin Lakes, it was breathtaking.   So worth It! 

For about the last 1 1/2 miles, it is challenging with a steep grade and a rocky trail. This hike should be listed as moderate, rather than easy."
73,2017-07-24,['hiking'],"7/23/17 - Beautiful easy hike. I had no idea how large this lake was. A little steep in a few spots, but all ages should fine."
74,2017-07-20,['hiking'],"This hike is absolutely amazing. If you plan on going on this hike do not give up at the beginning. This Hike can be steep for about a mile of your hike, but is well worth the view/lake. If you want to take the loop back around go on the trail to solitude lake. This will eventually take you back to silver lake.

Was about a 5.5 Mile hike all around there, and back."
75,2017-07-18,[''],great hike to pretty lake and view. moderate effort up. I didn't return on this trail but connected over to Solitude.
76,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"Twin Lakes is a beautiful hike this time of year with the wildflowers in bloom. We saw many flowers along the trail today including Rocky Mountain Columbine, Blue Bells, various penstemon varieties, and many more. 

This is an easy hike with a moderate uphill climb most of the way, and some rocky areas. Twin Lakes is a great hike for kids of all ages with a rewarding destination at the end of the trail. The Twin Lakes is a large, alpine lake, surrounded by rugged mountain peaks. 

My son and I hiked this trail today and enjoyed a great afternoon outside. He is only two years old and made it almost all the way to the top by himself. I only put him in the backpack towards the end when I noticed he was getting tired. I carried him downhill on the way back too, because of it was steep and rocky. I didn't want him to take a bad tumble. 

I'd recommend hiking around the lake while you're there. The scenery is spectacular and there are wildflowers growing everywhere. It can be a little sketch in a few places with some down climbing, but it's well worth it and a fun little adventure."
77,2017-07-15,['hiking'],
78,2017-07-12,['hiking'],"I wouldn't consider this an ""easy"" hike.  It is quite steep the whole way, and the footing is incredibly rocky!  Even my proficient hikers (14, 7 years old) found this hike quite challenging.  My middle two kids really struggled, but they persevered and were so proud they did!  Heck, most of the 20-Somethings on the trail were all huffing by the top.  But, WOW, what a pay-off!  Not only is the lake beautiful, we also saw all kinds of wildlife.  We'll definitely go back and make a day of it.  There were huge fish up there calling our names."
79,2017-07-12,[''],
80,2017-07-11,[''],"Up hill all the way, not that bad.  Beautiful once you get to the lake.   Well worth it."
81,2017-07-07,['hiking'],Gorgeous and got to see a MOOSE
82,2017-07-05,['hiking'],"I would consider the retain to be intermediate.  while there are some nice scenery, I feel like the payoff at the top of the trail was okay.  I personally like Lake Mary better for the effort.  I would like more of a trail around the lake.  Maybe if you go higher above the dam will you get a better vantage of the lake."
83,2017-07-05,[''],Moderate hike. Definitely not easy
84,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"This trail is rated as easy, most likely due to the fact that it's only a little over 2 miles out and back. However if you haven't adjusted to the altitude yet, you might find yourself out of breath for the majority of the hike up hill. There's many opportunities to take water breaks in the shade. Bring more than a bottle of water per person and wear good sneakers/hiking shoes. The last 1/4 mile is rocky and steep, but the view of the lake at the top is well worth the hike. We took a couple of short breaks and completed the hike in about 1.5 hours. Nature center at the base, bathrooms, ample parking, water bottle refill station "
85,2017-07-01,['hiking'],2nd time in a week doing this tried to get to mount Millicent but was too rocky.
86,2017-06-30,[''],Beautiful views. Much rockier and steep than I expected in a shorter distance than I thought based on the easy rating. Some of my kids thought it should have been at least moderate. :)
87,2017-06-29,[''],Fun hike! Last part of hike was rocky and steep but well worth it! But very doable! My kids are 5 & 7 and they handled it well.
88,2017-06-28,[''],"Kids enjoyed it and did pretty well.  A nice challenge from easy silver lake loop.  Gorgeous lake views, moderate incline, will do it again."
89,2017-06-27,[''],A lot steeper than I thought it would be!
90,2017-06-22,['hiking'],"A good portion of the trail is a fairly steady incline, but it's very doable. There was still some snow near the top and the lake was partially frozen over, which was very pretty. It doesn't take very long, so we also hiked up to Lake Solitude beforehand."
91,2017-06-16,[''],We had a blast!
92,2017-06-11,['hiking'],Snow still covered parts of the trail and the lake was frozen over in places as well. The hike had a pretty steady incline for the most part but it was very fun and I enjoyed it. I plan on going again later this summer when more snow has melted.
93,2017-06-02,[''],very good with the family. will definitely go again
94,2017-02-01,['hiking'],"Twin Lakes was a perfect destination for a good picnic! The sand was nice to play in and there were plenty of rocks to keep my son busy not to mention the bigger rocks that we were able to lounge on. it was a bit windy by the water in comparison to the rest of the hike but the breeze felt good and the view made up for me forgetting to bring an other layer of clothing, my son was far more interesting in playing to notice a bit of wind."
95,2016-10-30,['hiking'],"The trail around Silverlake is boardwalked all the way around and is a very easy trail. I went when it was raining and it smelled like pinetrees and soil. It was awesome! Great trail for kids. If you want to make things a little more challenging, take the spur trail that goes up to Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes Trail is rocky and slippery when it's wet, but the views of the lake by the dam are spectacular."
96,2016-10-30,['hiking'],"A great day hike that is a combination of not too intense and a good workout. This is a 2.5 mile out and back that gets increasingly steeper as you go along, all together it's about 800 in elevation gain. 
The trail starts at Silver Lake which is the first parking lot on your right once you hit the one-way loop at the top of big cottonwood canyon at Brighton Resort. 
You'll take the boardwalk around Silver Lake and once you hit the northwest corner of the lake there is a trail that heads up the mountain, and that is the one you take. The trail keeps climbing from there until you arrive at Twin Lakes. 
The lake is pretty exposed so every time we have been there, a pretty good wind has been ripping across the lake cooling things down quite a bit. 
Depending on the time of day and time of year this can be a great hike for wildlife, we have seen moose, deer, marmots, and squirrels."
97,2016-10-02,[''],My 2 & 3 year old completed this trail without much help. The last 1/4 of the trail is a rocky ascent but there is a slightly hidden dirt trail above the rocky one. We took our time the whole way up. One of my favorite trails. Lots of wild life.
98,2016-09-26,['hiking'],"Don't be fooled by the ""easy"" rating. This is not an easy hike. We saw many families with small children turn around or be forced to carry the kids because they were too tired to keep climbing. When you reach the top, the scenery is beautiful."
99,2016-09-21,[''],This is an awesome hike. It's pretty steep for the whole way but it's such a short distance it's totally doable. The lake is gorgeous.
100,2016-09-20,['hiking'],"This was a nice short hike with a great destination. If it hadn't been so late in the evening I would have loved to hike completely around the lake, but only made it about a third of the way. Also, there's a little path to the side of it about half a mile up that has a stunning overlook of Silver Lake!"
101,2016-09-16,[''],"This trail was very crowded. Once we made it to the lake, we hiked the trail around it (which was way more secluded) before heading back down. This made the trip well worth it. I definitely suggest hiking around the lake. Beautiful views and wildlife in every direction."
102,2016-09-01,['hiking'],"I consider this trail as close to moderate. Most of it is going up and you will encounter some steep trails. The Lake/Reservoir is nice but not as spectacular as the other lakes around this area. There is a trail that goes around the entire Lake with some areas that are diffcult and dangerous for kids. Started the hike around 7:30 AM, saw several deer but no moose."
103,2016-08-30,['camping'],"I was able to make it from the parking lot to the lake in about 15-20 minutes. The loose rock wasn't as troublesome as I imagined. I came across moose, a dozen or so deer, and tons of critters. The lake is a beautiful spot to photograph he sunset or sunrise."
104,2016-08-28,['hiking'],"We approached it from the Solitude Lake trail, going in a big loop back to Silver Lake. I recommend doing it that way. It got a little hard and steep in the approach, but definitely worth it for a great view."
105,2016-08-25,[''],"Great hike, little more moderate than easy with a steady incline and lots of loose rocks. The lake is beautiful!"
106,2016-08-15,['hiking'],"I would not consider this an easy hike - more moderate.  Though it was a short distance, the constant incline and tons of loose rocks made it a pretty slow going climb.  It took us about an hour to climb.  The sign on the trailhead said it was 1 mile, but I think it was longer.  I'd recommend this trail if you're looking for a workout with a beautiful view."
107,2016-07-31,[''],"Lots of traffic, beautiful hike though."
108,2016-07-31,['hiking'],"Great hike, 1.25 hours on a stairmaster. More moderate than easy for this 59 yo moderately active woman. I'd do it again though. If you don't like crowds, this is not for you."
109,2016-07-30,['hiking'],We did the Twin lake Lake Solitude loop.  Very nice hike.
110,2016-07-27,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail. Took my 2 year old- on foot, no carrier. We made it the entire way. Lots of beautiful views! Only complaint was we forgot our bug spray and we regretted that. Definitely bring bug spray. Might suggest bringing a carrier for your kids if they aren't active hikers. My little guy is used to long hikes so he hung in there. Will be doing again soon! :-)"
111,2016-07-26,['hiking'],"My only regret is being caught unaware. The trailhead says 1 mi. (I'm still questioning that) I was wearing my youngest in a mobi wrap and thought a few times it would flatten out, it didn't. But we made it and t was worth it! Just know it's an uphill hike, on either the harder side of being ""easy"" , or the easier side of ""moderate""... You choose ☺️"
112,2016-07-17,[''],Would rate this hike Easy-Moderate. The view is well worth it and the trail is equipped with decent footing & boulders for quick resting - plenty shade and cool breezes.
113,2016-07-15,['hiking'],"I would rate this as a easy-moderate hike - but I think it's all relative :) Pretty rocky but there is a side dirt trail that a bit steeper at times but literally saves your butt when coming back down. Beautiful lake (even with the dam wall). Beautiful view looking down on Brighton and Silver Lake. Saw a moose sitting down, just chomping on grass - couldn't care less that we were there. Make sure to bring the bug spray."
114,2016-07-09,['hiking'],"This is a moderate short hike, I love it and will do it over and over."
115,2016-07-07,[''],"Nice short hike, something to bust out after dinner or work. Good chance to see deer or moose along this trail at sundown. Trail gets a bit rocky and steep as you start gaining elevation after coming around the backside of Silver Lake but nothing difficult really and you're rewarded with an excellent view over Silver Lake and the property around Brighton."
116,2016-07-04,[''],"Beautiful area!  In our hiking party we unanimously voted that this trail is mislabeled.  It is NOT an easy trail.  Better to know that before you go.  We would say it's moderate.  It's a good hike and steep. It has some nice shade along the trail.  It is very rocky and steep the closer you get to the lake.  But, the scenery at the end is worth the effort.  There are rocks and lots of trees around the lake to sit and eat a lunch.  Nice breezes too!"
117,2016-07-03,['hiking'],Very good. First hike in 15 years. I took a jaunt all the way around twin lakes. Was a little tricky on the south side. Lots of rocks and not well marked trail. Well worth it.
118,2016-07-03,['hiking'],Rocky and steep!! Great hike 
119,2016-07-03,['hiking'],Beautiful! If you're looking for a longer distance. Hike from silver lake to twin lakes and then follow the maintenance road down to lake solitude and then that'll take you back out.
120,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"Great hike, Silver Lake was beautiful and the Twin Lakes were even better."
121,2016-07-02,['hiking'],A good hike for a family with small children.
122,2016-06-29,[''],"I have been wanting to do this hike for some time but always forget.  I packed up the truck with 6 kids this morning,  planning on going to Lake Mary. driving up the canyon, a little melancholic because all my friends backed out on the hike I thought of this lake so we went here.  it was a great hike.  the weather was perfect.  had some raindrops while at the lake.  left my phone at the gas station so no pictures."
123,2016-06-26,['hiking'],Beautiful day at one of my favorite spots.  How lucky are we to live in such a great city and be in amazing outdoors areas in a short period of time?
124,2016-06-25,['hiking'],"Great trail, took the kids in hiking backpacks. With a child on your back it ends up being a pretty good workout. Beautiful view of Silver Lake about halfway up the trail. Would definitely do it again."
125,2016-06-20,[''],"Silver lake loop trail is a easy hike for young kids----also went on to twin lake which is a steep climb, grand kids made it all the way."
126,2016-06-19,['hiking'],"Beautiful lake. Saw a bunch of deer, a moose and a porcupine! Nice hike to enjoy with the family."
127,2016-06-11,['hiking'],"We loved this hike. It was simple enough to bring our small kids up, but difficult enough to feel like we got some kind of a workout. There was still some ice on the lake and patches of snow on the trail. 

The trail markers weren't up so we ended up taking the wrong trail for a few minutes before we figured it out."
128,2016-06-10,[''],"Short, but still a good workout.  Beautiful views and lots of wildlife if you're paying attention.  Good after work hike."
129,2016-06-10,['hiking'],First time doing this hike and thought it was a good 'un. Great for a summer evening after work.
130,2016-05-20,['hiking'],Hiked this trail from the pass to the trailhead as part of an extended hike. Beautiful views from the top.
131,2015-10-31,[''],its a great short hike not tiring at all !
132,2015-10-24,['hiking'],"I love this trail! It's a very short hike, though a bit steep. Very doable, though. This would be great for kids since it's short and has beautiful scenery and great views all the way up. If you have time definitely take a walk around the whole lake. It's so beautiful! If you're looking to make a longer hike out of it there are a few trails you can connect with once at the lake and continue on to a few different destinations."
133,2015-10-11,[''],"This is definitely bordering on moderate. While not long, the trail is consistently uphill and you'll be navigating scree and rocky ground much of the way. That being said, the scenery is gorgeous and the trail is certainly doable for all ages. There are lots of big boulders to sit on and enjoy the lake for a few minutes before heading down."
134,2015-09-25,[''],This hike was really nice. Especially right now with the changing of the leaves. However I think it should be rated moderate not easy. The entire trail is up hill the entire way.
135,2015-09-22,['hiking'],"Great short hike - a little steep but worth it. Some loose rocks/footing on the upper portion of the trail. We saw people of all ages hiking - so definitely do-able for kiddos and older folks!

The fall colors are incredible right now!! The aspens are bright yellow all the way up the trail and around silver lake! We were here a few days ago in the evening and saw tons of deer and a moose with her calf! No animals this afternoon though.

Lots of large fish jumping in the water at both silver lake and twin lakes.

Will definitely do this one again!"
136,2015-09-15,[''],"Easy hike up to Twin Lakes, ran into moose. I would recommend the connection Twin Lakes has to Lake Mary & Catherine. It is only a mile or so from Twin and you get to hit all three of them in one visit."
137,2015-09-11,['hiking'],Awesome and beautiful!
138,2015-08-04,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail. We saw several deer, a young male moose, tons of birds, and cute ducklings at silver lake. 
This trail starts at silver lake. Walk on the boardwalks to the far side where the trail heads for Twin Lake and Lake Solitude are. 
The trail to Twin Lake is pretty steep the whole way, but not too terribly bad. Currently it is one lake (or reservoir) even though lots of maps show it as two. I guess when the water is lower there is a rocky divide between the two. 
You can continue on to Lake Mary on a small trail the diverges at the opposite side of the dam. If you continue on the larger road/trail it will take you up Mt. Millicent to the top of the lift. I don't know where it goes after that because it is super steep and we turned around. 
There's tons of beautiful views, wildlife, and wildflowers."
139,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"A little steep but not bad. Beautiful lake, great place to throw rocks in the water and at stuff (according to my husband). Saw 4 or 5 deer"
140,2015-07-25,[''],"Starting this trail from silver lake gives your body a minute to begin warming up before you hit the incline. Once on the trail you will find that for the inexperienced the trail may be a but difficult due to the quick elevation and incline of the mountain. 

There are two trails up to the lake, one is very rocky and the second is a dirt path. They both end in the same place the dirt path just offers you the opportunity to hike the incline without scrambling over boulders so much. 

Once to the ""lake"" I would suggest climbing higher past the little cabin looking feature and sitting on the rocks above twin lakes. the views are gorgeous and you can avoid some of the crowds scattered around the lake. 

if the hike up didn't kick your butt keep going up the trail by the cabin. it will take you right up by evergreen peak and leads to some higher elevation views. unfortunately, if you hiking right now in july the higher portion of the trail is closed due to trail maintenance which also closes off the loop you can take to see lake solitude. 

if you are a more experienced hiker getting to the trail should take no time at all. I believe it took the both of us 25 minutes. don't forget to enjoy the views of silver lake once you get up that first incline. if you still feel up for a hike when you finish I would suggest going up the hill and going to lake mary, she is beautiful!"
141,2015-07-09,['hiking'],"I keep reading reviews that it was a super easy hike, but it was steep, and had very loose rock. My 6 and 4 year old completed the hike, but it was very slow going with all the rocks. The wild flowers were beautiful and breath taking views of Silver Lake. Twin lakes has a giant dam and the lakes are now one. It's still beautiful though. Lots of moose tracks along the way. I gave it 4/5 because of the beautiful views. My recorder also marked it at 3.2 miles and 807 feet elevation change."
142,2015-07-07,['hiking'],"Easy hike for the whole family. Our youngest (2.5) managed the hike as well. Gorgeous views. Lots of wild flowers and ground squirrels about. The lakes and surrounding mountains are beautiful, but the lakes have actually been turned into a single reservoir, complete with an ugly cement wall on the east end of the lake. Still very beautiful though. On our way back to the car, we completed the nature trail around Silver Lake. Next time we'll add in Lake Solitude to our hike."
143,2015-07-02,['hiking'],Did this on a Wednesday evening with a small group.  Temps were in the 70's.  Lots of folks up from the valley to beat the heat.  Trail got congested at times and there were too many noisey young people.  With that said it was a beautiful hike.  Wildflowers are coming out along the trail as you approach Twin Lakes.  Be prepared for mosquitos near the top.  Nice to still see snow on the surrounding peaks.
144,2015-06-23,[''],"This is a quick, fun, scenic hike. We did the loop around to Lake Solitude. There is some  trail maintenance  going on so take care going down to Lake Solitude.  There's a cute mom and calf moose hanging around Silver Lake."
145,2015-06-11,['hiking'],I started from silver lake and it is only a mile from that trail head. It is fairly steep. Short and intense like someone else said. But the view was amazing and totally worth it! I was the only one up there. Will go again for sure!
146,2015-05-30,['hiking'],"Climbed this last night 5/29 - beautiful warm and sunny evening. Still light snow pack on some parts of the trail, but easily passable. Trail has a couple of steep spots, but nothing strenuous about this hike. Took me 40 mins tp get up at a very leisurely stroll, and 12 minutes to run down. Absolutely gorgeous scenery. Lake was 80% slushed/frozen over, but melting fast. See pics."
147,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"Such a beautiful lake! I just wish I had more time to explore the area, however the view was spectacular. Not very much people on the trail and very quiet and serene. Would definitely recommend this to hikers who are not wanting too long of a hike or too short."
148,2014-09-07,['hiking'],"loved the Twin Lakes, short and intense! next time im definitely going to go all the way up to Solitude and make my way back down! I LOVE UTAH!"
149,2014-08-03,['hiking'],"This is a pretty steep and rocky trail, but the lake is really beautiful."
150,2014-07-28,['hiking'],Beautiful trail for the family - the wildflowers were in full bloom along the way. The lake was serene and a nice payoff after the climb.
151,2014-07-21,['hiking'],This is a great hike for a hot summer day. It rained on us. We saw an amazing rainbow from Twin Lakes. We also saw a bull moose grazing a the bottom of the Dam. There was a large variety of wildflowers. We purchased a book to help identify them at the Nordic Center for $15.
152,2014-07-08,[''],Pretty rocky and steep at places.Longer than the 1 mile that it says it is at the start of the sign. Very pretty in the end. Follow the dirt trail rather than the rocky path. My 6 year old hiked the entire way.
153,2014-07-06,['hiking'],Really loved this hike. Was enough distance to feel like an adventure without being strenuous. Beautiful views at the end.
154,2013-07-11,['hiking'],"We made a large loop out of it to Silver Lake and Lake Solitude. It came out to 4.53 miles and took us less than two hours. Out of the three lakes, Twin Lakes was by far the nicest. The trail seemed easier than the one we did two days ago to Lake Mary and Lake Catherine.  We started at the parking lot in front of Silver Lake."
