I’m willing to bet that you’d see no one on a regular weekend. This hike is tough. Another reviewer described it as “sustained elevation gain.” That’s the perfect description. It’s pretty much straight up the whole way. It’s beautiful, mostly shaded, and worth it but definitely be prepared with water and time. The last push, not quite a mile, before the lake(more like puddle) is full sun but there’s a lot of shade near the puddle."

2,2019-08-10,['hiking'],"8/10. Started at 8:30, wouldn’t start later than that took about 3:45 to get up. 7 hours total on the hike and that was staying at the top for about 30 minutes. Hike was a beast. After about 4 miles the trail opens up and is super beautiful. Only saw 5 other groups on the trail. Hiking by myself until the last mile when I saw some other groups. Amazing view from up top!"

4,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! We did it round trip yesterday in 6 hours and 19 minutes. We went pretty fast but spent about 25 minutes on the peak because it was really good weather. The snow is basically all gone now. It’s a very doable hike, but definitely don’t underestimate it!"
5,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Amazing hike. Did it on a Saturday and saw very few people. Didn’t see anyone till we began our descent. Tough but doable. Plenty of shade for a good chunk of the hike. Very green and absolutely beautiful. The snow is basically all gone.
6,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"We luckily did it when it was overcast outside. Extremely steep! We didn’t bring enough water, but other than that it was absolutely amazing! Even saw a moose and her baby 3/4 the way up! "
7,2019-07-23,['hiking'],Hard but Good.
8,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']","I did this on 7-21-2019 and was blown-away and pleasantly surprised.  1st thing, the map doesn't quite take you to the TH, keep going from where it cuts off and you'll end up at the parking lot past the camp ground. You then will start the trail and take a left and cross the log to begin the trail (007). This trail is very intense, challenging even to me and I hike 3 times or more a week. I'd recommend a lot of water and wearing pants due to some overgrown spots. Snow was mostly gone, just one path towards the summit. This trail was jaw-dropping, peaceful, and sparsely populated.  There are butterflies everywhere and you can enjoy the views and sign the guest book at the top. It took me about 6 hours round trip, going at a decent pace. You could go faster if you trail run. I saw one small black bear as i headed down by the first mile marker. No problems, the bear kept their distance. Do this hike! no cell service until the top (tmobile). "
9,2019-07-10,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'snow']",Definitely a tough one. I didn’t think it was too bad until the last mile. That last mile is brutal and there’s still a good amount of snow that I had to scramble across. The views are worth it though. You can see for quite a ways. I lost my license up there so if you see it let me know haha
10,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"This trail is beautiful! Once you've made it up about 1/2 mile, you don't really see other hikers. Very steep in areas,  but well worth it for the scenery.  May be my new favorite trail in Utah County. "
11,2019-07-07,['hiking'],a great high output hike I would suggest some good hiking boots. it's beautiful the whole way up
12,2019-07-07,[''],Challenging hike.  Sustained elevation gain for 5 miles. There are still snow fields found intermittently along/across the trail you’ll have to traverse but the views are spectacular! Be careful and have fun! 
13,2019-07-07,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'snow']","Pretty intense hike! We made the summit but had to traverse through some snow here and there. The view was awesome! Totally worth it, but I’m definitely going to be sore tomorrow!"
14,2019-07-04,['hiking'],"Nice hike through steep forest with stream into a small lake basin, still some snow so we skipped the peak - its nice, but its no Mt Timo IMO "
15,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",Such a beautiful hike up a small stream and through beautiful mountains. This hike is just as amazing as hiking mount timp as far as scenery goes. 
16,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']","Really good hike, a bit steep at times but worth the climb. After reaching the lake there is a lot of snow, and the trail disappears so you have to do a bit of trail blazing yourself through some scree and bushes. The summit is beautiful and worth the hike. Just be ready to slide in some melting snow and get a bit wet. Muddy at times, but still a doable hike! Worth the effort! "
17,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']","Super fun, steep hike. Beautiful scenery. Hit snow about 2 miles in and hiked about .5 miles past that point in slushy snow. It was tricky and we turned back about halfway to the summit. Definitely doing to do it again."
18,2019-04-20,[''],"me and my oldest daughter did this trail every weekend last summer,  from April until August. I was preparing for a long trip in the uintas.  beautiful..."
19,2018-09-06,[''],Trail is closed (8/31/18) due to a Bear in the area
20,2018-07-12,['hiking'],"Did this as a night hike, on a moonless night. If you can do this at night I highly recommend it. This was easily one of my favorite trails, this close to town. We left at roughly 1:30 am. Got to the top around 4:30-5:00. Watched the sun come up and got some great pics. I went with a friend and recommend you don't do this one alone if possible.

The trail is very steep in spots and has a lot of rocks in it, but it's not so bad.

On the way down we got to see all of the scenery. It's absolutely beautiful. We also saw a lot of deer, an elk, and tons of cows. At night our headlamps lit up the eyes of the cows, it was quite unnerving to just see their eyes.

There are bears in this area so bring some Bear Spray.

Bottom line it was one of my favorite hikes, so far, this summer."
21,2018-06-30,['hiking'],"Love this hike, but got quite the scare today when I came across a bear and two cubs on trail. Be safe! https://wildlife.utah.gov/learn-more/bear-safety.html"
22,2018-06-28,['hiking'],"Not as hard as expected, I hiked it at night and made it to the peak about two hours before sunrise. And what a view! It took me 3 hours to him up and 2 hours to hike down. I would definitely recommend it."
23,2018-06-27,['hiking'],Hiked this with my dog today and it was incredible!  Got to the top in a little less than 4 hours and down in 2. We are quick hikers but just want to give some reference. When you get to the top saddle go left and you’ll almost walk all the way around the peak then go up. Enjoy!
24,2018-06-23,[''],"This is one of my favorite hikes. I hike it every spring and fall. Every time I’ve hiked it I’ve seen something new. Moose, wildflowers, elk. All the other reviews are spot on. Every time I hike it I’m reminded that you earn every mile!"
25,2018-06-03,['hiking'],"Snow is nearly all gone (opposed to the post from 3 weeks ago). Hike was great! There is some ‘ice’ but mostly snow past the ‘lake’ (pond? Large puddle?), but only for a short stretch. I did the hike in tennis shoes and got to the top just fine. Though if you know anything about this hike, the full trip is almost constant uphill, not for the faint of heart. With the little snow that’s left past the pond, we did get to slide down the snow for a quick descent, opposed to the occasional slippage on the way up at that point.
With a half hour spent at the top, and another 0.5-1 hour nap at the pond, it took us almost 8 hrs exactly to get to the top and back, and we weren’t going a slow pace on the way up. It was around 4 hrs to get to the top (including my first longer nap I took at the pond), but we took our time at the top and had a normal distracted person pace (absorbing the environment) on our way down."
26,2018-05-07,[''],"Made it to the lake. You need snow shoes.   Over 4 feet in some places.  The lake is not frozen, but it is all slush. tons of snow up there. snow starts at 7000 ft. happy hiking!"
27,2018-03-18,['snowshoeing'],"Went up to maple lake and camped the night there. The snow up there is untouched and we were probly the first people since November to be up that high. Beautiful this time of year. Had to start from the mouth of maple canyon though and the one way journey took us about 7 hours. 12+ inches of powder once you get above 6,000 ft"
28,2018-01-29,['snowshoeing'],"I tried this trail a couple of days ago right after a fresh snowfall. Maple Canyon was closed at the mouth so I had to hike up to the trailhead at Whiting Campground adding a few extra miles. I made it about halfway to the peak and hit my turnaround time. It was slow going blazing a trail in the untouched snow, but was a lot of fun. I want to try it again when I can move a little faster."
29,2017-10-09,[''],"I may be biased because it overlooks my hometown and childhood, but what a great hike! The last assent to the peak is probably the hardest part, but the view well worth it!"
30,2017-09-24,[''],it's a really hard hike. I have done it twice. steep grade to the lake/puddle then really steep to the peek. in late evening I ran in to moose on my way down. great views.
31,2017-08-07,['hiking'],"This is a hard hike in my opinion. It really is up hill pretty much the entire way, and the further up you go, the more rocky and unmarked the trail becomes. There are times that I have wondered if I was still on the right path. Not a trail I would take my kids on until they were a little older and had some good practice to build endurance. 

The views are great once you hit the lake (or puddle, depending on the year and season). I've never gone all the way to the peak marker, I just stop at the lake. Next time I'll go all the way. 

Despite the difficulty, I've done this trail several times and I'm always glad I did."
32,2017-08-06,['hiking'],"This hike is uphill the entire time with few exceptions. After mapping it out in detail it is 5.3 miles to the top, however, its a tedious 5.3 miles. Harder than timp in my opinion. Very pretty though all the way up and you go through forests, lakes and wildflower meadows."
33,2017-07-25,['backpacking'],"Consistently steep and rocky the whole way, but was well worth the effort.  Beautiful views of the Valley, Spanish Fork canyon, Diamond Fork, etc.  
The wildflowers were literally EVERYWHERE.  Very nice to look at, but when I say everywhere I mean even spilling into the trail.  In many parts we had to walk through foliage as tall as me (I'm 6 feet tall) that would almost completely cover the trail.
We camped at the lake on a flat, grassy spot (the only good place we could find to pitch a tent).
It does get a bit confusing after the lake.  A large tree had fallen over the trail which has led a lot of hikers to form their own trail leading only to a snow field (very small when we were there).  When you come back down you can see where the trail should be.
I would rate this as harder than Timp even though it is shorter, but still well worth the effort."
34,2017-07-21,['hiking'],"Like everyone else has said, it's steep and rocky the whole way. It's also very overgrown at parts. The views and wildflowers are AMAZING and make it totally worth it. I hiked it today (July 20) and there was no snow.
As a side note, I think the trail may be slightly longer than advertised. Two separate distance trackers got it closer to 12 miles than 10.7. Could be wrong though."
35,2017-07-04,['hiking'],"I did this trail a week ago. We started at 2:20am and went at a decent speed with a fairly athletic group and got to the saddle a little before 6a. From there I caught the sunrise and the other half of the group found a way around the snow to the summit. The last climb to the saddle was pretty scketchy with the snow, but otherwise a great hike. Pretty steep and consistently rocky the whole way. Views and wildflowers made it worth it!"
36,2017-06-25,[''],"the hubby said let's go for a hike. I figured since him and the boys did it on mother's day I should be ok... lol!! I'm a little more out of shape then I thought. we made it just over 3 miles up but it was getting late because we started later in the day. beautiful!! going up and up and up I was ok, just needed to stop now and then. going back down is when my knee finally said enough! recommend some kinda pole or hiking stick! also when the hubby and kids went up they did see a bear. so please be safe. take water and goodies to keep your energy up. (only 4 stars because the wrong name on here, we call it Maple mountain) 6-24-17"
37,2017-04-11,['hiking'],"Wonderful trail! All the other reviews are spot on: it's steep, relentless up, it 's beautiful, sharp rocks, poles highly recommended (and for me, close to home).  Being mostly on the east side of the mountain it is cooler but gets darker sooner.  I have not actually been to the top, rather I use it as my training trail.  With a full pack I start out at the top of the campground and go as high as I can in 2 hours, then turn around and come back down.  Last year I made it about 1/4 mile from the 'pond'.  I also think the sharp rocks helped wear out my hikers so fast after about 12 trips.  After that kind of training, I'm ready for my week long trips in the Uintas - that's how good it is.  Believe it or not, while heading up once, I actually met some mountain bikers coming down!
This year I plan to take a day pack and go clear to the top - after I'm in shape again.
If you see a solo hiker with a pack going up or down that trail, it's probably me - so say hi."
38,2017-03-11,[''],It was sooo fun we went up on the 4th of July and got to see fireworks at the top!
39,2016-10-13,[''],"Great views, cool forests, and one of the greenest hikes in this area! Lots of fir trees, so it smells awesome. Did it today and the fall colors and weather were perfect, the trail wasn't slippery at all."
40,2016-09-21,['hiking'],"We hiked this trail in mid-late September and the variety of foliage was absolutely breathtaking, truly some of the most beautiful I've seen and you're hiking through a lovely forest. The weather was a perfect 75 degrees and everything was as we were warned: very rocky, relentlessly steep, and slippery (dust and pebbles on the slopes), some taller steps for anyone with knee issues, and be sure to catch the proper 007 trail at the bridge going right (we also thought we might have missed the trailhead - just go all the way to the end of the campground). Good shoes and enough water an absolute must (the ""lake"" was entirely dry). I took 5L of water and it was just enough. 

Everyone says that it gets less steep after the first 1.5 miles but we didn't notice any change except for brief respites until the basins in the lake area. The trail leading to the peak is well enough laid but the ""shortcut"" was not obvious (i.e. which is the one to take?) When you get to the top of the saddle and turn left after all the switchbacks, the ""shortcut"" veers just slightly left and looks like a cattle or goat trail along the edge. The ""trail"" goes slightly right and around the ""front"" side of the mountain with a spectacular view of Spanish Fork, Mapleton, and Springville and Utah Lake. It will feel like you're going off rather counterproductively but it meets up with the shortcut before the final brutal ascent (and frankly, it's a very nice, level trail and gives your legs a rest). The view at the top is unbelievable and worth every breathing break you had to take on the way up. 

Observations: you definitely need good shoes with a thick sole and traction as the rocks are often sharper than river stones (I hiked in 5 Fingers which did not have enough sole on them), poles would be helpful on the downwards, there is less daylight in Fall than in Summer so that's the tradeoff for the heat. Between shoes and thigh muscles that weren't up to it (causing a knee injury in a fall) and coming down in the dark, it took us 14 hours. Be wiser than I was and have a great hike!"
41,2016-09-20,['hiking'],Great going up....harder going down but so worth it!
42,2016-09-02,['hiking'],"I'm a little late with this as I hiked the trail July 2nd of this year.  Being a holiday weekend, I think there was more traffic than usual, but I still only saw 4 or 5 groups and one of them was a scout group.

The trail starts out very easy, but keep an eye out for the fork in the trail at the creek. It's easy to miss. It's right at the metal bench that will be on the left.  Cross the creek and continue another quarter mile or so when you'll notice another branch to your left.  Keep going straight here and the rest of the trail is easy to follow (minus the fallen trees across the trail).

As has been mentioned, the trail is relentlessly steep until you cross over the saddle at the top of the basin. The trail is shaded much of the way, and it is very pretty though.  When I did it, there was no snow on the trail and the spring flowers were amazing.

Good shoes are definitely a must as my worn down hiking shoes were constantly slipping on the way down.  I brought a water filter to top off at Maple ""Lake"".  I ended up drinking 4 liters for this hike and would consider 3 liters a minimum with all the sweating I did on the steep hike up.

I don't know if links to outside websites are allowed, but here's my youtube view from the top. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFLBOMt8npQ

Overall, it's a tough hike, but very pretty and well worth it.  I'll be doing this one again next year."
43,2016-08-14,['hiking'],"Yes it's a great hike with incredible 360 degree views at the top, but it's very tough. Hiked it yesterday with my three teenagers. Tougher than I remember from eight years ago. With hardly any break, the steady elevation gain is relentless. Fortunately the shady beginning and the beautiful views as you approach the bowl and ascend to the peak make it all worth it. On the way down the steepness makes it sketchy in many places; be sure to have good shoes, and poles would be helpful. Also, suggest not taking the short cut on the way down; it's very steep, and didn't seem to save that much time. Toughest part of the way down though is the end -- it seems to keep going and going before you finally reach the creek crossing. In short, suggest starting very early, taking lots of breaks, and with older kids at least, plan for 8 hours round trip, which was the time it took us."
44,2016-07-22,['hiking'],This is a great hike. I don't know how anyone could give it less than five stars. I loved the beautiful groves of trees the whole way up and they definitely helped my two golden retrievers stay cooler on the way down. Great views from the top as well. It is pretty steep but it makes going back down easy. Took me 3 hours and 20 minutes to get to the top and 1 hour 40 minutes to get back. I can't believe so few people hike it. I didn't see a single person until I was almost done and they weren't going to the summit.
45,2016-07-14,[''],It's a great hike! Absolutely beautiful definitely worth the effort!
46,2016-07-10,['hiking'],Hard trail.. More for horses..I have done twice..steep narrow paths..softball size creek rocks a must to avoid.
47,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"Although a good hike, it is my least favorite of the Wasatch seven peaks. Nothing spectacular to view until you are near the summit and the lake is really a pond. But, any summit hike is good enough to experience."
48,2016-06-27,[''],it was absolutely beautiful . it was challenging but a great hike! definitely going to be a regular hike from now on!
49,2016-06-26,['hiking'],"Fantastic. Pretty tough hike, but I did it when I was 11, and my 11 yr old daughter did it yesterday. Be prepared with water and snacks.  Also, just a note that all the locals refer to the mountain as Maple Mountain."
50,2016-06-06,['trail running'],One of the most beautiful aspen groves in the state along this route.  Plenty of opportunities for wildlife viewing.  Saw three Moose when I hiked this during the fall. Very steep at the top but the trail is in good condition the whole way.
51,2016-04-22,[''],Hard.
52,2016-03-24,[''],"I hiked this last summer. This was a hard hike for me. I took 3.5l of water and ran out about a mile from the car. The view from the peak is great. I was able to get some cell service at the peak. I also tried to hike it in the fall. I enjoyed it a lot more even though I had to turn back before the lake/pond, do to wind and snow. The turning leaves and canyon views were beautiful. In the summer I took my hammock and hung it from the metal pyramid over the survey marker, to rest. I truly need the rest. Parts of the trail are steep, rocky, and have no shade. Some parts of the trail had all of that at the same time. If you plan to take bike it or ride a horse you should know when I went there were several fallen trees. Some at ground level some at waist and some at shoulder. And some parts of the trail were overgrown with thick vegetation. I would do this hike again, but I need to be in better shape."
53,2015-09-12,[''],It was a very rocky trail which made hiking a little slower than normal. It was definitely more than 8.5 miles - more like 10.5 miles round trip. Beautiful views to the west and east of the peak.
54,2015-07-12,['hiking'],"This was a strenuous, but enjoyable hike. The way up is relatively consistent, with anywhere between 15-20% grade most of the way. There are some areas that were quite overgrown, but the trail is still very easy to follow and you can't get lost. Additionally, be prepared to climb over, under, or around at least about a dozen trees along the trail. These are still pretty easy to navigate. I found the second half of the trail to be the best. It opens up into mountain meadows, with beautiful views of the summit and an abundance of wildflowers. About a mile from the summit, you'll come across Maple Canyon Lake. Just stay away from it. It's about as rank as it looks. Once at the summit, you get commanding views of all the peaks of the area. Leave a note in the journal in the mailbox up top before you leave! 
*Disclaimer* - This trail is about 11.1 miles from the trailhead (used my Garmin and the AllTrails app). It took us about 5.5 hours to complete, but the trail is far longer than the site suggests (unless someone approves my updates)."
55,2014-04-17,[''],Does anybody know if there is snow on the peak or trail ???
56,2014-03-04,['hiking'],"Difficult, but worth the view. Takes a while and you WILL be sore the next day"
57,2013-06-23,['hiking'],"Distance when starting from the Whitings Campground parking lot is about 11 miles. The trail (#006) starts out with a gradual climb from the parking lot located at the very end of the campground. Initially the trail is very wide (possibly an old road) and is accessible to hikers, horses, bicycles, and motorcycles. The trial is dirt and covered in small to medium sized rocks. 
After about a third of a mile the trail (#007) crosses the creek and heads to the south. From here the sign says it is 5 miles to the peak, but my GPS measured 5.4 miles from the junction. For the first couple miles the trail is fairly wide and rocky. It is covered in medium sized rocks due to decades of horses on the trail. The trail is very easy to follow and there are mileage indicators every half mile (some of these have been broken and are laying on the ground). 
After about a mile the trail begins to narrow and becomes much steeper. The trail continues pretty much south in and out of the trees climbing almost the entire time. Some portions of the trail are almost entirely covered from the side by vegetation. Think of bushes growing over the trail. One benefit of all the vegetation is that up until about mile 3.5 the trail is very shady, even in the middle of the day. 
At about 3.5 miles the trail opens up a bit and a little distance further heads west towards the pond. There is no outlet from the pond and horses water there so if you drink from it purification is a must. Past the pond the trail continues up becoming very steep in some sections before it switch backs to the ridge overlooking the city of Spanish Fork, UT. 
From here the main trail heads South before turning East for the final climb to the summit. There is also a small shortcut trail that follows the ridge straight up to the peak. 
Despite its lower elevation this is a difficult hike. Bring a lot of water as the stream on trail #007 is almost always dry and the pond is sketchy. The peak offers great views of the southern end of Utah County along with a look at all the other Utah County peaks (Timpanogos, Mount Nebo, Loafer Mountain, Provo Peak, Corral Mountain) as well as a distant view of the Uintah mountains."
58,2012-06-19,['hiking'],This trail is brutal! My family hiked 4 maybe 5 mile to the lake below the summit. The elevation gain is 3100 feet. The trail is very rocky and is a knee killer. It took us a little less than 4 hours to make it to the lake. My children are 10 and 8 years old and have a lot of hiking experience. Very rough on the descent with many loose rocks.
