0,2019-08-17,['hiking'],Easy trial.  A few places a little rocky but I would not say hard at all.  I saw numerous 3&4 year old kids hike up to the lake no problem.  Saw several ground squirrels (I think and a moose.   Creeks were running across roan in a few places but just a few inches deep.  Watched some climbers go up a wall.  Lots of wild flowers.  Didn’t know Utah had Indian paint brushes.  I’d go back
1,2019-08-13,['hiking'],Cute
2,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"Amazing trail. Very well marked and TONS of wildflowers out right now. Saw well over 15 species of flowers, lots of birds, a male and female moose. Loved this hike."
3,2019-08-07,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'off trail']",Beautiful hike once we found the trail but it was hard to find the starting point due to a lot of construction and having to detour around bulldozers and such. Ended up going off trail and then having to cross a small river to get back on track. Would wait to do this one again until construction is cleared 
4,2019-08-07,['hiking'],Absolutely gorgeous! We loved everything about it. Bring that bug spray because you’re going to need it! 
5,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']","I loved this hike. Took me about an hour and 15 mins to get up to the lake. Spent about an hour at the lake, I walked all the way around and took pics from different angles. Slipped in the snow! Crazy there is still snow up there. Wild flowers are out and beautiful on the way up! "

7,2019-08-04,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky']","one of my favorite hikes to do every summer! The wildflowers are gorgeous,  and you'll miss out if you take the shuttle! Park in the street and start hiking just beyond the ranger booth (the parking lot is under construction!). "
8,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade']",Hiking from the basin definitely made it a more intense hike but it was still fun and the flowers were gorgeous. Amazing view
9,2019-08-03,['hiking'],Great hike! The flowers were blooming and it was so beautiful! 
10,2019-07-28,['hiking'],Flowers are beautiful right now!
11,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"We were unable to get to the trailhead due to construction,  so we entered the Snow Pine lodge and took the elevator to the bottom floor.  There was a door in the back that lead to a trail that took us to the trailhead.  The trail was mostly clear except a couple of small muddy patches. The wildflowers are almost in full bloom, probably another week, but there were still many to see and it was beautiful! There was a mama moose and two babies in the basin.  Lots of people doing the hike on a Saturday.  Beautiful views and the incline was steady except the last 1/2 mile was the steepest. "
12,2019-07-22,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']",
13,2019-07-21,"['hiking', 'no shade']",Lots and lots of folks out on a Saturday
14,2019-07-18,['hiking'],Construction is in the way!
15,2019-07-17,"['hiking', 'snow']",
16,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",This will be a breathtaking hike in about two weeks when all the wildflowers are in bloom!
17,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'snow']","Still quite a bit of snow up there. Lost the trail several times, but were able to wander and gps our way there. Peaceful surroundings, noble for trees, majestic view of Sugarloaf peak in the background. "
18,2019-07-06,"['trail running', 'snow']",Practice trail run for the Wasatch Peak series run at Alta. Trail still has a lot of snow up by the lake and around the basin. Lots of creek/running water on and crossing the trail.
19,2018-10-22,['hiking'],"Hiking up to Cecret Lake from Albion Basin during the Summer is the best time to go and is definitely worth the adventure! There are wildflowers all the way along the trail up to the lake. It is about 5 miles out and back trail. You could do a loop too on a service road back to the main trail head, if you go West from the lake (it is a little steep). Make sure you bring a light windbreaker (it can be chilly near the lake), also bring at least 1.5 liters of water and a snack or lunch with you to enjoy near the lake. It is a popular hiking trail, so the traffic on the trail may be moderate/busy, the best time to go is on a weekday or early morning. 
However, right now they are doing some construction for Alta Ski Resort, which is difficult to hike the trail this Fall Season 2018.

To find more fun posts and my adventures follow me on Instagram @adventureswithchase! Thanks!"
20,2018-09-28,['hiking'],"The Cecret Lake trail is closed as of 09/24/2018. Construction crews are repairing a dam just below the lake that was built in the 1920s. 

I couldn’t go up to the lake, nevertheless it is an amazing area. It might be due to the trail closure or because it was a weekday, the trail heading up from behind the Albion Grill was almost deserted. It felt as if I had the mountain to myself.

I would love to come back later and complete the hike."
21,2018-09-04,['hiking'],"My family hiked from the Albion Basin trailhead because it was too crowded to park at the campground trailhead. They were only letting in one car for every car that left with no estimate on wait time. That was OK with us, we enjoyed the longer hike, but the kids got a little tired. 

This trail was pretty crowded, and while I'm glad lots of people were enjoying the hike, I was unhappy with the lack of ""trail etiquette."" People on the way down refused to yield the right of way to those climbing. I was even cussed out by some people behind me because I kept yielding to people coming up as we descended. People were also ""wading"" in Cecret Lake which is strictly prohibited. 

We saw a couple of young moose and their mother on the trail through the meadow area under the ski lifts. That experience made the entire trip well worthwhile. The kids were thrilled!"
22,2018-08-20,[''],"Beautiful wild flowers, though here are definitely less as this point in the season. The lake is fun too. If the ski lift is running, you can take it down the mountain for free! Busy hike"
23,2018-08-09,[''],"There are several ways to get here, but the outdoors hiking group I went with started from the bottom and hiked our way up: 5 miles round trip. We started our trail behind Albion Grill and slowly worked our way up. Along the trail, you'll see wildflowers, deer, a hidden restaurant, tons of hikers, stunning green foliage, and be greeted at the end with a lake. I didn't see any moose on the trail, but others have seen them in the past. 

If you're not up for hiking 5 miles, you can pay $6.00 to park closer going 1.5 or 3 miles round trip instead. 

Pictures doesn't do any justice for Cecret Lake. You actually have to be there and experience the views yourself.  Hopefully my pictures show how peaceful this place can be with tons of hikers around! Just gotta find that sweet spot that no one will be around to photobomb your lake!"
24,2018-08-06,['trail running'],"I’ve done this hike twice this summer. Once on an early Sunday and once more the following Wednesday after court for my speeding ticket in the town of Alta. Make sure you slow down as the speed limit changes from 40 to 25.

I parked at the Alta ski resort and hiked from there. You can drive up further to an upper parking lot, which shortens the hike substantially. 

This was a great trail run with amazing views and plenty of room to pass others hiking. My total elevation gained was 1,119ft and took me 1:07 a total distance of 4.8 miles."
25,2018-08-04,[''],"This was a really fun hike. The scenery is excellent with a good mix of open meadows with wildflowers to more dense tree cover. The lake was a great reward at the end and a fun place to relax for a bit. Not the most strenuous hike, but I’m glad we did it."
26,2018-07-27,['hiking'],
27,2018-07-25,[''],Beautiful scenery everywhere and tons of side trails that all take you to the lake so you have plenty of options and variety. Most of the hike is easy but it’s a bit steep at the end. Nice little lake even though a bit crowded.
28,2018-07-24,[''],"Took us 1' 45"" from the base of Sunnyside and Albion chairlifts to the lake and back."
29,2018-07-23,[''],beautiful and pretty easy trail. we saw teo moose and one deer. lots of beautiful wildflowers. the water was low at the lake but still pretty
30,2018-07-16,[''],"I felt like I was walking through a post card. The flowers were beautiful, the trail was easy to follow, the lake was nice (although the journey was the better part). If you are on the fence, do it. Now! It was perfect."
31,2018-07-13,['hiking'],Beautiful easy trail.
32,2018-07-11,['hiking'],"it was a very pleasant hike ,98 degrees but the beauty of wild flowers make it all worth it!"
33,2018-07-09,['hiking'],We did this hike just a couple of days before the road to the trailhead was open.  I guess it opens at the end of June.  The extra walk isn't bad because of the beautiful flowers along the way but it is a little tricky to find the trailhead.  So beautiful!  Crazy salamanders!  Steep but not too long.
34,2018-07-09,['hiking'],Took us about 2 hours to hike there and back. The wildflowers are beautiful right now. Lots of mosquitoes around the lake. I'd recommend bringing bug spray!
35,2018-07-08,[''],"This hike starts at Alta, by Albion Base. It starts by the Albion grill. Walking up a little ways and then the meadow is breathtaking this time of year. So many wildflowers. Continuing on, you hit a gravel road that leads to the Cecret lake parking area. This hike is decent, took us about three hours total with a stop at the lake for lunch."
36,2018-07-07,[''],"Started from parking lot by Campground and headed to the north west. I was enjoying the beautiful trail and pond, but then I got to a sign that says trail closed for construction.  Sad day.  So you current have to walk down Albion basin road to the road to a road that turns west and the take a right and hike on that trail.  If you want to see the status of the trail check out my blog for a 360 degree virtual like hike. https://shaunasadventures.blogspot.com/2018/07/360-adventure-albion-basion-cecret-lake.html?m=1"
37,2018-07-06,['hiking'],"was going to the cecret lake trail due to reviews, but got  to the booth next to Alta ski resort and after they told me that the paved portion of the road ends and you need to pay i decided to go the free route and go to the ski resort which was free.  Glad I did...I started up the trail from the ski resort not knowing what to expect or where I was going really.   After hiking up the first trail with wild flowers all around I realized that just up the road a bit was the start of the cecret lake trail so I combined the two....the weather was great.....alot cooler than in the valley and the lake was pretty cool too.   For me it was a pretty tough hike.... easily the most elevation that I have gained on a hike(I just moved to Sandy a few days ago) and close to the longest, but well worth it.  By not driving up to the cecret lake trail head parking area I saved some dough....got more exercise, saw wild flowers that I wouldn't have seen and I still got to see cecret lake.   I am more proud of this than I would have been as I don't think too many people hiked up to the lake from the resort.   Bring some water and some food and take your time if needed.  On a side note.... there are some geocaches around this hike if you are into that.  oh....and when you get back from your hike you can grab a bite to eat in the resort, relax and enjoy the air conditioning and look at the pics you took."
38,2018-06-29,[''],"Took five little kids up one mile to the meadow. It was a bit chilly, but the flowers are gorgeous!"
39,2018-06-18,[''],"The wildflowers are incredible, and the lake is so beautiful!"
40,2018-06-18,['hiking'],"Views beyond compare!  We did this hike on June 17.  Some minor patches of snow on the trail toward the top.  The wind was more chilly than we had prepared for so bring a windbreaker at the very least!  Luckily, my kids had hoodies tied around their waist.  We saw moose here last year in August, but none during this trip up.  This was my second time up this trail and it is a new family favorite."
41,2018-06-18,[''],"Last week-end the gravel service roads were closed to cars so we had to park way down from the trailhead and had to walk up the service roads for 50 minutes just to get to the trail. Then we hiked about 45 min to the top to see the lake. There was still snow on the trail in some spots and it was quite muddy, but warm weather when sunny. You had to cross two or three creeks with slippery rocks but often you could find a long way around- just avoid the mud. The lake still had patches of ice and was beautiful. I don’t need to do this trail again for a few years. Took 4 adults 3 1/2 hours"
42,2018-06-16,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! There was still some patches of snow and it was quite cold at the top. In a few weeks when all the wildflowers bloom it will be absolutely breathtaking.
43,2018-01-20,['hiking'],Hiked as part of a loop from Alta to Germania Pass
44,2018-01-11,['hiking'],"Nice trail, but dogs are not allowed in the canyon nor on this trail. I took my dog with me but after seeing all the signs, I left her in the truck. I was stopped by a Ranger who was kind enough to let me know that you can’t even have a dog in your vehicle. Apparently the ticket is $550. So, be forewarned."
45,2017-11-29,[''],"Snow is really deep right now (almost knee deep in some areas) and we couldn't make it to the top because it was too steep and dangerous with the snow, ice, and rocks. Would recommend waiting until summer for this one!"
46,2017-11-20,['hiking'],"The walk from the Albion parking lot to the actual trailhead was pretty uneventful. You follow a road that winds through a ski resort. It adds a lot of time to the actual trail (so plan accordingly), but once you hit the cecret trailhead the hike is short, elevated, and fun. Great spot. Being from out of town, I would've loved to see the alpine lake in the spring or summer!"
47,2017-11-09,['hiking'],Great hike to do with the kids.
48,2017-10-22,[''],"Some snow on the trail today, a little bit of ice but not much. Beautiful drive from SLC and the snow made surrounding peaks very beautiful."
49,2017-10-19,['hiking'],Beautiful!
50,2017-09-21,[''],First part of the trail is walking up a ski slope which is covered in the most beautiful wild flowers. Part of the trail is under construction.  Lake was beautiful and there was a moose hiding beneath the trees.  Definitely hike up the mountain behind the lake for some gorgeous views.
51,2017-09-08,['hiking'],Not my favorite hike this season. Lots of people and construction.
52,2017-08-18,[''],"In my opinion, don't drive up to the cecret lake trail head never any parking. My suggestion is park down at the base plenty of parking plus a longer hike"
53,2017-08-17,['hiking'],Absolutely fantastic trail filled with wildflowers in mid August! Got there early and saw a big uptick in foot traffic by midday. What a beautiful experience!
54,2017-08-16,['hiking'],"Gorgeous wildflowers, moose, and lake. Tons of hiking traffic."
55,2017-08-15,['hiking'],Great trail...show up early and you'll have it to yourself.
56,2017-08-04,[''],"Did this hike just this week. Incredible wildflowers carpeting the meadow and hills! The mountains, trees, creek, flowers, & lake, create a gorgeous environment. Mother Earth in her pristine, perfect state."
57,2017-07-28,[''],Wildflowers everywhere
58,2017-07-27,['hiking'],WILDFLOWERS
59,2017-07-27,[''],The wildflowers are spectacular.
60,2017-07-21,['hiking'],GO NOW! Start from this lower parking lot and bask in the wildflower beauty. We did the upper portion of this hike before but this this round we started at the base and stopped short of the upper parking lot (with kids). This was perfect and absolutely beautiful.
61,2017-07-19,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail from the parking lot at Albion Base on Sunday July 16 at 10am. This was the most crowded I've ever seen the trail, especially when it meets up with everyone skipping the beginning at the Albion Campground. Luckily, most people are either too lazy or unaware of the very best part of the hike this time of year: the absolutely gorgeous wildflowers in the meadows between the Base parking lot and the campground! There seems to be about a 2-3 window when the wildflowers are in full bloom, and it's starting to happen right now. Bring your camera!"
62,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike!  The wild flowers were in bloom and it was amazing.  There was still snow on the trail and a few small creeks you have get over, but, other than that is was fun hike.  It was really packed the day I went, this hike I would probably wear good shoes the terrain is a little muddy.  Will definitely hike again."
63,2017-07-09,[''],Beautiful wild flowers on a mellow trail following a trail and dirt road. The highlight for me was the meadows filled with wild flowers in the sun
64,2017-06-28,['hiking'],"*BEWARE* several parts of the trail are in construction zones and have therefore been rerouted. However the rerouted ares are not marked very well and can be confusing as there is still plenty of snick and runoff covering the trails. 

This was my first time doing this hike and it was a lot of fun. Definitely recommended."
