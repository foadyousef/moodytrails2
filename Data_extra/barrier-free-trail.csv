1,2018-06-28,[''],"Very short, easy. It's a stretch to call this a hike since it's essentially a sidewalk, but great view from a newly built deck at the end, or from nearby rocks. You can do the trail as mapped, but you walk through the resort, which is less fun. I suggest driving past the 'trailhead', down Alta bypass Rd, and park just beyond the over pass. There's an obvious trail that traverses above the resort to meet up with the paved path. It's marked with a dotted line on the all trails map."
2,2017-10-21,['hiking'],Was looking for an easy hike with the kids. this was easy and great for kids. i give it a 3 because yes your up in the mountains but you walk through the snowbird resort and then along side it. i never saw any signs for this trail. we just followed the gps and then walked around the trails that run along and through the resort mountain. Fine for our group but not a favorite.

I gave it 4 stars because while kids can enjoy a good view, they prefer a waterfall, lake, or cave at the end of a hike.  We accomplished this by following the dirt trail near the overlook point down to a creek where we could ""put our dogs (feet) in.""  That made the hike 5 stars!"
4,2017-07-25,[''],Easy trail for our kids.  They liked to read the signs and enjoyed climbing the spread of natural rock formations.  There were some huge pine trees and the view at the end was lovely even if part of the view was the Snowbird Resort.
5,2017-07-03,['hiking'],Hiked this while we were waiting for a 30 minute delay of the Snowbird Tram. Hoped to also hike the Peruvian Gulch Trail from the top of the tram but the altitude affected my wife so we took the chair lift back down
6,2017-06-09,['walking'],Great little hike for the kids. The platform at the end gives a great view area. Still some snow banks by the trail. Had fun with snowball fights.
7,2017-06-08,[''],"Super easy paved trail. There is an observation deck at the end that has beautiful views. 
Went today and there was still one spot right before the observation deck that had snow on it."
8,2017-02-01,['hiking'],"​Great few! This is a fun trail that leads to an over look up at snowbird. I would recommend this short hike for families with smaller children and anyone who is up having fun at snowbird resort. ​I took my lunch up which was nice. This trail is more of a little walk with hardly any incline, definitely a very easy trail."
9,2016-06-09,['walking'],"Just over a mile total. Paved easy incline walk.  Perfect for toddlers and grandparents!  A benched overlook at the end of the trail.  It is barrier free, so no fences except at the overlook.  We took a two year old on this and he enjoyed it with little water streams from the melting snow.  Plenty of rocks, sticks, and small critters to look at.  We did this walk in the early evening in the beginning of June and the weather was pretty much perfect; 75 degrees, plenty of clear skies, most of the snow gone."
10,2016-06-04,['walking'],Beautiful.  Good for little ones. Right now it is blocked with some snow about 1/4 in though.  Not easily passable with stroller. But you can walk over it.
11,2015-09-20,[''],This was fun with my kids. More of a walk than a hike. It's paved and has a nice look-out point at the end. Great for families and kids.
