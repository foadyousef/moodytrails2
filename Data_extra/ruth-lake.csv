0,2019-09-02,['hiking'],Very easy hike - in and out with a little loop around the lake. Very scenic. I would give it 5 stars but the beginning of the trail was rank with dog/human feces and there was dog waste just off the trail. 
1,2019-08-31,['hiking'],"Great simple hike to a gorgeous lake with ideal camping sites. We caught brook trout in the lake and ate them for dinner. There is an awesome hike that starts from here, lofty lake loop, which was a nice day hike for our trip. Would definitely do again."
2,2019-08-24,['hiking'],A truly easy hike in a gorgeous setting. Completed 8/23/19. Very few bugs. Not much shade but the temps are so cool it doesn’t matter. Ruth lake is beautiful. Will definitely do again!
3,2019-08-22,['hiking'],"My new favorite hike! Wildflowers we gorgeous a week ago with plenty of life left. My kids 10, 8 and 5 did this trail easily and even my 2 almost 3 year old could do most of it, just a lot of help over boulders. Next time I'm in the Uintah's, I plan to do this again!"
4,2019-08-18,['hiking'],Beautiful right now! Super easy for kids.
5,2019-08-07,['hiking'],Really great short and beautiful hike ! A lot of bang for your buck !  The drive is worth it !! 
6,2019-08-03,['hiking'],Beautiful and easy hike! Lots of wildflowers blooming right now! Pretty reflections on the lake. Be sure to bring mosquito spray. 
7,2019-08-02,['hiking'],Beautiful trail that is great for kids.   Nice lake that is fun to fish. 
8,2019-07-26,['hiking'],July 26th late bloom season but the flowers were amazing!! It was a rainy windy day so keep the bugs at bay but I would imagine if it had been sunny and nice out they would have been pretty bad!
9,2019-07-22,['hiking'],This trail had beautiful meadows and a wide array of wildflowers. Great hike for beginners - not too steep. We made it to the lake but didn’t walk around the lake because of the mosquitoes. Bring deet - they’re relentless! I’d definitely like to go backpacking here when the mosquitoes aren’t as bad. 
10,2019-07-19,['hiking'],"Glorious hike! Beautiful alpine meadows, surrounding breathtaking views. Not muddy at all and hardly any bugs. Brought the hammock and relaxed while my husband fished and caught a lovely little trout. Not busy at all. For such a short hike, it packs a punch! Hard to beat the views! "
11,2019-07-11,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. Would be great for day hike. Too many loud campers for an overnight stay.
12,2019-07-06,['hiking'],Very accessible!
13,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'snow']",
14,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'blowdown', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']",Great trail.  Still snowy and wet.  Will come back again. 
15,2019-06-29,['backpacking'],Great hike! We ended up backpacking and staying one night at Ruth Lake.  Wasn't too busy for overnight campers. Peaceful & beautiful area. The water was lovely! The boulders were a bit rough at the beginning of the trail with the overnight pack but was manageable for the kiddos and beginners in our group after that. 
16,2019-03-15,['hiking'],"Beautiful, fairly easy trail with a lot of places to get off the trail and explore. Fantastic photography opportunities as well. I’ve taken the dogs and kids as young as 4 and always enjoyed this hike."
17,2018-10-28,[''],"We loved this trail!! It is fairly easy the whole way. The steepest part is right at the begin where there was a little bit of snow, not much more than an inch and the rest of trail was very good. You get to the end and Ruth Lake is so so gorgeous! Not a long time commitment and so wonderful!"
18,2018-10-24,['backpacking'],Good backpacking starter trip for the young kids.
19,2018-09-22,['camping'],Short hike. Lots of people. Really pretty too. My 6 year old did it no problem carrying his own pack.
20,2018-09-10,['backpacking'],"Took my boys on this trail. It was a great beginner trail for them to get started on. We went on a Thursday evening and there was only one other group of campers on the other side of the lake. We found a good spot in the trees and setup our hammocks. The weather was beautiful and surprisingly, the mosquitos were minimal. I would definitely come here again."
21,2018-08-22,[''],"As someone who doesn’t love steep or strenuous hikes, this was perfect! It’s a rockier trail in the beginning but pretty flat and you get to water really fast. Brought the dogs who had a great time swimming as we made our way around the lake. It smells like pine and there were Lilly pads on the lake and a beautiful mountain backdrop! Also super secluded, although we went on a Sunday afternoon. Honestly loved it and would happily return!"
22,2018-08-21,[''],Beautiful when the flowers are blooming early summer/Late June
23,2018-08-15,['hiking'],It was a great trail for my kids and us to walk. Did explore a lot around the lake and a ton of rocky areas my kids climbed the afternoon away.
24,2018-07-24,[''],"This trail is short and easy, you can make it longer by exploring around the lakes. Great for dogs and kids- or out of towners:)"
25,2018-07-04,[''],"One of my favorite hikes, once you get past Ruth lake you encounter very few people and the scenery is breath taking!"
26,2018-06-23,['backpacking'],Short hike but you still enjoy a remote feel and views and have additional access to Naomi and Hayden lakes adjoining Ruth.
27,2018-01-26,['hiking'],Beautiful hike. Did not catch any fish but had a great day!
28,2017-08-26,['hiking'],"So this is only 3/4 mile to the lake. If you walk around the lake then you can clock more miles. It's definitely kid friendly. The terrain is mostly rocks and small boulders, which is not my favorite, but there was still a lot of green. The lake is one of the most beautiful I have seen. I walked around the right to the far side and I could have just stared all day. Wonderful views! Quite a few people camping and fishing. Best to go mid week after summer vacation."
29,2017-08-19,[''],"Great for little kids and dogs, good place to backpack in and camp with the family. It's getting cold overnight this time of year."
30,2017-08-07,['hiking'],"Easy beautiful trail. Large rocks and dirt trails go through patches of trees, rock platforms and fields of wildflowers and brooks. I went in the beginning of August and there were still lots of beautiful flowers all over throughout the trail. The trail itself is well maintained and defined. Don't get confused by the pond, the lake is further and has a wood sign on a tree. You can actually do an easy loop around the Lake perimeter as well which takes you through more patches of trees and fields of flowers. There were yellow lilies on the far side as well as nice camp sites. I also saw lots of chipmunks and deer even! This is a new favorite!"
31,2017-08-06,['hiking'],"Easy, well maintained trail with lots of water and beautiful scenery. Don't stop at Ruth Lake. Looking back across the lake from the trail above is spectacular."
32,2017-07-29,[''],"One of our favorite family hikes, beautiful wild flowers."
33,2017-07-28,[''],Can't go wrong in the Ashley national forest
34,2017-07-27,['backpacking'],"Great trail and well maintained. We took our three little girls (5,3.1) for a two-nighter to Ruth Lake! Lots of rock for the kids to explore on."
35,2017-07-17,[''],"This is one of my favorite hikes in the area! It's a gorgeous hike to a gorgeous lake. It's easy enough that my older parents and also children enjoy this hike. Beautiful, easy hike."
36,2017-07-05,[''],I took four kids backpacking up here and it was a beautiful area with the lake and several streams.  My kids are young and this was the perfect area for a first backpacking trip.
37,2017-06-19,[''],Beautiful trail. Great trail for beginners.
38,2017-06-19,[''],"Great trail for beginners, beautiful trail."
39,2016-10-02,['hiking'],"Perfect hike for kids and beginners. Nearly flat, gorgeous scenery, and a quiet lake. But OMG the mosquitoes in July! Would love to do this in the fall before the snow because the swarms of mosquitoes detracted a bit from the hike. They don't care about biting through OFF or clothing!"
40,2016-08-28,[''],A definite favorite for my family with little kids.
41,2016-07-21,[''],Easy hike took less than 30 mins. Con... Mosquitoes all over the place and OFF doesn't phase the little F'ers...
42,2016-06-27,['hiking'],Very short and easy hike. Dog friendly.
43,2016-06-26,[''],Toddler friendly. Short. Beautiful!
44,2015-10-23,[''],Very scenic trail with well-marked path. Nice payoff at Ruth Lake. Easy hike.
45,2015-09-29,[''],"Have loved this hike ever since I was a kid! Pretty trail and fairly easy, good for kids and adults. The lake at the end is gorgeous and fun to fish, but can get crowded on the weekends. My family usually goes farther to other lakes, but the trail peters out around Naomi lake and you have to bushwhack to other places. Great day hike or beginner backpacking as the lake has some good camp sights."
46,2015-06-29,['hiking'],"Easy hike in. If you have time, go to the surrounding lakes."
47,2014-07-07,['hiking'],"Nice short medium level hike, good for the kids. There's a beautiful reward at the end. They do stock the lake, so bring a pole!"
48,2014-06-10,['hiking'],I really enjoy this shorter hike for the family.  We came up to it while camping in the area.  This hike will give you the experience of hiking the highs without the all day hike that a lot might not want to do.  You can catch a couple easy Peaks close by if you want to take the extra trip.  Over all I think anyone would like this hike.  A favorite of mine.
49,2013-11-10,['hiking'],Easy hike to a pretty lake
50,2013-09-02,['hiking'],"Very easy hike. The fishing at Ruth Lake was great in the morning and it was beautiful. We hiked over to Hayden Lake and walked by Naomi Lake. Hayden Lake had some small fish. A fly fisherman there had luck catching tiger trout in Hayden. Naomi Lake doesn't have fish in it but it's still scenic. It's a very easy day hike or over-nighter that has a lot to offer, especially if you check out some of the other lakes nearby."
51,2013-07-22,['hiking'],"For our trail we hit Ruth, Hayden, Jewel, Cutthroat and Teal Lakes. This was a short overnight trip for us but can easily be a day hike. It's a good trail for our beginning/young backpackers and our new puppy. A dog friendly trail with many small streams, ponds and lakes for water. Scenic with constant views of majestic peaks, small meadows, lakes and the wild flowers are abundant. There was more people than expected at Ruth Lake and if you're looking for more solitude, head further up the trail to Cutthroat Lake or Teal Lake where we didn't encounter anyone. More details can be found in the track we made for this hike."
