0,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'no shade']","Not much fun today and I’d say this is moderate/hard, not easy. Loose gravel and rock makes ascent and descent tricky. Lots of bees in early September. I would not recommend for novices. The waterfalls are nice but not much of a payoff.  "
1,2019-09-01,['hiking'],"1. Leave early - no shade on the hike.
2. Not moderate - trail gets quite difficult, and slick.
Not a bad trail overall, but I wouldn’t do it a 2nd time."
2,2019-08-27,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Walked along a fence in the beginning of the trail. it was mostly Up hill. Wasn't much of signs for the trail. But I figured it out. At one point you have to cross the steam and you see a small cave you go up on the came side and continue up and you will see the waterfall. I was going to go back down before seeing the falls but then I saw some water coming of some grassy rock ahead I walked to it and then saw the waterfall ahead. it was beautiful. some areas you have to scramble up and a lot of loose rock areas. but its a great hike.
3,2019-08-23,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'over grown', 'rocky']",Fairly easy going up until the creek. After that the trail  an be pretty hard to find at times and gets fairly uneasy at times. Definitely worth getting to the falls at the very end. Probably my favorite hike so far.
4,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","the trail map is very helpful to find the trailhead; it is otherwise pretty hidden. The first 3rd of the trail is very steep and exposed to sun, not much to look at, but the remainder is very enjoyable. Shoes may get wet. We came across two rattlesnakes on the trail. good payoff for an initially tougher trail. "
5,2019-08-17,"['hiking', 'scramble']","What a gem! Great short workout. So glad I chose this trail! Once past the first mile of road-like trails, it starts to follow the creek up the canyon and it is amazing! The creek drowns out the traffic noise and I had the entire trail to myself! Took me 90 minutes and I spent lots of time scrambling around the falls. Will be back to do more hiking around the creek and falls!"
6,2019-08-16,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']","It is steep but doable. No shade for the most part. Once you reach the water, the trail is rocky and narrow the rest of the way up. However, even my three year old completed it by himself. I did have to lift him and my dog over a few bigger boulders/logs. It was definitely worth it, very gorgeous once you’re near the creek! And a cool view of Bridal Veil Falls! "
7,2019-08-09,['hiking'],Straight up a utility road pretty much. The lack of crowds and an awesome ending is the only thing this trail’s got going for it.
8,2019-08-07,['hiking'],"I took a dozen Boy Scouts up to the falls. We found a cool little cave that they loved. They loved hiking along the river the whole time. This hike gave them a little challenge, but not dangerous at all. The view up and back is gorgeous because you can look at Bridal Veil and the sunset the whole time. "
9,2019-08-06,['hiking'],Really enjoyed this hike. Went at about 9 AM and it wasn't too hot. It's worth noting there is no shade so wear a hat. As for getting to the falls we had to cross the stream a couple of times and was a little tricky. Loved feeling the mist climbing up to the top. Hidden little gem. 
10,2019-08-05,['hiking'],I don’t know what I was thinking choosing this trail. The first bit has you following a chain link fence—quaint. Then you travel through an overgrown trail and wade through tall grasses and weeds. Then you make it to a rocky trail that looks like it is for utility trucks. All the while it is full sun and it’s not high enough into the mountains to provide a cooler temp. I made it about 0.5 miles then made it to a 0.5 mile stretch where I could see the entire uphill climb. It was still full sun and no scenery (other than across the road where I should have chosen to hike....  so I turned around. I can’t speak to the falls at the end but can’t imagine it would be worth it.
11,2019-08-02,['hiking'],"This trail is crazy steep but the view is amazing! Took me about 2.5 hours to go up and back, including the time I spent exploring and taking pictures at the top. My dogs also loved it! Plenty of water to cool them down on the trail! 
"
12,2019-08-01,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'over grown', 'scramble']","Such a fun and rewarding hike. The canyon is very... cozy. Quite narrow so you cross the creek a few times. Beautiful waterfall at the top and great view of bridal veil. The first stretch of the trail has very little shade and is quite steep. Trekking poles were helpful for that portion. Lots of vines on the trail though that kept snagging my feet and poles. Nice and short, worth the climb."
13,2019-07-30,['hiking'],"Really enjoyed this hike. It’s pretty steep but not long, so it’s very doable. The trail isn’t the easiest to follow, I relied on AllTrails a lot. It follows the river all the way up, the falls are pretty and it’s very secluded, which was surreal. Nice little area to explore, saw lots of slugs."
14,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"Great hike, but a consistently steep climb. If you park at the end of the pipeline road directly across the highway from the Bridal Veil Falls viewpoint, you'll save a half mile and 100 feet vertical each way."
15,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'scramble']","I hiked this with my husband, 11 yr old daughter and two dogs. This trail is a little difficult to find but so worth it. Park in the north Nunns Park parking lot and head east. When you see the cement shack, that is the starting point. It’s pretty much straight up on a rocky trail until the creek starts. Bridal veil falls is across the street and directly behind you as you hike. Once you hit the creek you continue the climb to the falls. Plan on getting your shoes wet because you cross the creek multiple times. Cooling off at the falls was so refreshing and made the hike down great. It’s beautiful and so peaceful at the top. Lots of areas to sit and eat lunch. There isn’t a lot of shade and this is best done earlier in the morning or on a a cooler day. We only saw three people the entire time. "
16,2019-07-23,[''],"Not sure why this isn't rated higher. Its an oasis up by the falls and not a single soul on a weekend. The ""trail"" can even continue after the main falls to more falls. "
17,2019-07-23,['hiking'],I uploaded a pic to show a beautiful creek we saw on our hike. The trail was kinda confusing though and we had to stop partway through because we got lost. Will go again and wear swimsuits so we can get wet!
18,2019-07-12,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky']","beautiful trail; did it twice in June. we got chased out by a storm the first time. wildflowers were beautiful, and there was a lot of water. not much shade, but when you get by the water, the temperature drops. it's worth going past the log jam up to the falls themselves, so make sure you keep going! :) and bring some water. "
19,2019-07-08,"['hiking', 'blowdown']","Steep unremarkable road for the first mile, the remainder of the trail is fun, many stream crossings and slide debris. The view at the top back towards bridal veil is worth the effort."
20,2019-07-04,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Took four of my kids on this hike (all under 8). They were able to make it to the river and then roughed it about a 10th of a mile more. We didn’t make it to the waterfall, but did manage to get to a cliff that had a little waterfall and some mist. It was a fun place to stop and get wet.

I will just be re-stating what other reviewers have said, but know that the mile to the river is ver y steep and unrelenting. Once at the river there is no trail and no easy way to hike. You will be crossing the river and scrambling over the rocks the entire way. You will also need to study the map before going or follow it in this app because which trail to take is not well marked.

"
21,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",The other reviews I read were pretty accurate.   Having this app open while hiking will help you stay on track.  Once you turn up hill the way is clear but the path gets a little challenging.   We were hiking with our dog.  With about .25 miles to go it gets very technical and you cross the stream more than once.  Be ready to get your feet wet!  Last stage is not dog or wife with less than sure footing friendly!!!  They stayed back.  View at the top is rewarding!  Great trail for the adventurous because you kind of forge your own path at the end.  Would love to do this hike again!
22,2019-06-30,"['hiking', 'rocky']","We went in the evening and the trail was perfectly shaded all the way up! The last part is for adventurous hikers as you need to cross the stream a few times and there is not a clearly marked trail, but the views are so worth it! "
23,2019-06-29,"['hiking', 'no shade']",This trail was not clearly marked. It seems like you are just walking on an abandoned road or that your trespassing for the first while and the avalanches must have gotten rid of the trail just you just walk along the stream but the creek is beautiful and the view of Battle Creek is awesome too. 
24,2019-06-25,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'washed out']",This trail provides beautiful scenery and the last quarter is the challenge due to the frequent avalanches that occur during the winter. The first 3/4 of this trail is intact and is moderate but the last quarter is hard and you must Improvise and Chris across the creek at several points. I had a great time and you get a nice cold drink anytime you want it in the spring during the snowmelt.
25,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Easy going on a wide trail much of the way to the canyon mouth though steep at times. The best views open into the canyon along the stream and as you view Bridal Veil Falls behind you. Hiking stream-side is slower and technical but worth it all the way to the falls. Worth seeing again!
26,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'scramble']","Following the map here on All Trails gets you easily to the trailhead (don't use google maps). So fun once you get in by the creek, and it cools down in there, too! Perfect hike for adventurers!"
27,2019-06-14,['hiking'],"First part of the trail is nothing special, but once you get to the creek it is beautiful. Just follow the creek up and you will make it to the falls. We crossed back and forth a few times. A trekking or ski pole was great when crossing the creek. "
28,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'scramble']",
29,2019-06-02,[''],"This is a relatively steep trail. families with kids were walking up, but we were quite winded. We didn't make it to the top. The trail is where out. it is gorgeous and we want to go again. 
Be careful if you enter the trail at Nunn's Park because we turned the wrong way. "
30,2019-05-26,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble', 'snow']",the falls are gushing right now
31,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'scramble', 'washed out']",Hiked on 05/25/2019. Avalanche has washed out most of this trail. We got to the creek crossing and due to the trail being washed out we weren’t able to get much farther. Could see the falls in the distance about 0.5 miles up. The avalanche has melted and taken the trail with it.  Sad to see that the trail isn’t what it used to be but that’s nature’s way I suppose. There are still gorgeous views of bridal veil falls from the top of the trail near the creek. NOTE: The trail markings on AllTrails map are not accurate. There are no falls along the trail that branches right after the creek crossing. 
32,2019-05-06,[''],"I hiked this last week and we we're lucky and had hiking sticks and Spikes for our shoes.  It made it easier to walk up the Glacier from the avalanche that is over the trail right now.  I wouldn't go up if you feel worried at all.  We stayed really close to the edges of the glacier so we didn't have to worry about it cracking underneath us.  Amazing views along the trail.  I am definitely going back up later to see this without all the ice covering up much of the trail, but hiking up a Glacier was epic ...never done that before.  I made a 360 Google Earth Trail here for my blog.  you can see it and more pictures (although I think there is a better waterfall up higher) at ShaunasAdventures dot com"
33,2019-05-04,['hiking'],Great trail but due to an avalanche the trail was cut short.  It should melt soon.
34,2019-04-28,"['hiking', 'snow']",
35,2019-04-28,"['hiking', 'snow']",Was good. Couldn’t go any further as my GF got scared of slipping on the snow though.
36,2019-04-22,['hiking'],"TL;DR great short hike (but steep) to a nice 3 tier (40ish feet total) waterfall.

Hiked this past Saturday April 20th. It’s a dirt road you hike up for most of the distance. There’s a better place to start than what the map tells you, if you drive about half a mile further than the nunns park pull off there’s a small parking lot on the north side of the highway.

Went with my two kids, 13 and 15 and we all enjoyed it. Great views and the waterfall is nicer than I was expecting. It probably has more water running over it than bridal veil does right now due to being on the sunny side of the canyon. There was a fair amount of snow starting just before the rock couch (man made) about a mile in. We didn’t see the smaller two tier cascade in some of the pictures, under the snow still maybe?

The only wildlife we saw besides a couple other people was a single gopher snake at the rock couch."
37,2019-04-04,"['hiking', 'off trail', 'snow']","This was a fun hike! There is quite a bit of snow after the first stretch and would be miserable without waterproof shoes. Once in the snow, you can’t see the trail and just walk on the snow over the river. The snow is thin in some parts and could fall through to the water, but it’s nothing dangerous. The view of bridal vale falls is great!"
38,2019-02-18,"['hiking', 'closed', 'rocky', 'snow', 'washed out']","Steep trail, only made it about 3/4 of a mile before a man avalanche blocked off the trail and we couldn’t get past it."
39,2019-01-07,[''],I think it's definitely worth the steep and dull beginning to get to all that is to be seen above.
40,2018-12-15,['hiking'],"There was some snow on the trail, which made it easier to hike. From Nunns Park it is 1mile one way to the creek and the “Rock Sofa”. Trail is definitely steep, for that I would suggest it to be more of a moderate level hike. I have heard rumors of waterfalls on this hike, but didn’t see any except for bridal veil falls on the opposite side.  There were a lot of deer tracks, but didn’t see any."
41,2018-10-27,['hiking'],Beautiful hike! Lots of scrambling up the rocks
42,2018-10-17,['hiking'],"Rocky and not a pretty trail, old atv trail."
43,2018-10-06,[''],"Not a kid friendly trail! this was tough, took me a second to find it and then it was exactly a nice hiking trail. got to the top and wasnt that impressed. nice to waste time but the trip down was rough. the rocks were loose and even my dog had issues."
44,2018-09-11,[''],This wasn’t a bad hike. It’s definitely not kid friendly so I wouldn’t take your little ones. If you don’t read the description make sure to follow your map. It is easy to get confused. I enjoyed it but won’t do it again..
45,2018-08-26,[''],First part of this hike I'd say 3/4 of a mile kind of boring after that be ready for an adventure. I recommend not giving up on this one. You pretty much are walking in the river most of the time. Very rocky and pretty steep. The waterfall at the end is nothing short of amazing. Its a three drop waterfall. You can climb up to reach the top waterfall very easily but coming down not so much. Watch out for snakes. I did see four on this trail. I must say to the one person who climbed up this hike and wrote some messages on a few rocks near the couch area I know how you feel. Its not easy and don't give up.
46,2018-08-01,[''],It was a pretty boring trail until you hit the creek which was a lot more fun. Pretty view of bridal veil but nothing you can’t see from the highway. No one else on the trail which was nice. The stone couch was a nice place for a picnic.
47,2018-07-18,[''],Our favorite hike! It starts on a dirt road with a pretty intense uphill walk but opens up onto a creek running down the mountain. You can go as far as you want up the mountain following along the creek. It goes quite a ways! Nicely shaded in the afternoon.
48,2018-07-06,['hiking'],"Went for an evening hike. Not a single soul but our group. First part is pretty steep, then turns into a walk along the stream. We crossed at several points, but that wasn't necessary. Saw a few snakes, so be aware of what's on the trail. Overall, nothing spectaculat, but still a nice getaway that avoids the crowds at other more popular trails."
49,2018-07-04,['hiking'],"This trail is pretty lame up until you get to the creek. Before the creek its a pretty steep slant with the only good view being behind you of bridal veil falls. However, once you start going up the creek (following the little cairns along the way) you can see some pretty amazing smaller waterfalls and river formations."
50,2018-07-02,[''],"Pretty creek at the top, but not really worth the effort put in to get there."
51,2018-06-07,['hiking'],"Guys, this is actually a cool hike, but do know that the AllTrails map is wrong. Once you hit the creek just follow it up (unless you want you build a fire at the cool fire pit near the end of the AllTrails path), It's definitely a scramble as you travel up the creek. It gets more primitive as you travel further up.  I was glad I went with my brother -he helped me up and down the hardest parts. I definitely got my fair share of scrapes though. Careful of the loose rocks! We saw three different waterfalls though that are all worth seeing in person.
I recorded it and took pictures along the way, would recommend if you're up for a scramble!"
52,2018-05-19,['hiking'],"My first AllTrails trail! Me and my 3yr dog did it in a span of about 2 hrs 45 minutes. we are both pretty out of shape  it was the first hike I have done in about a year  and it was pretty difficult for me .  It's fairly steep  on what seems to have been an old Service Road. There were only two people we saw the whole time and that was on the way down. The view of bridal veil Falls was really beautiful to look at, however, this Trail itself wasn't anything too exciting and we probably won't come back to this one."
53,2018-04-25,['hiking'],"Not really worth it. The trail takes you along a fence line and most of the trail is actually more of a straight line, uphill service road.  That plus the close proximity to the highway make it a very ugly trail. The Creek was neat and the view of Bridal Veil Falls was great, but the waterfall was a real let down. It was just a small trickle and we were there in the spring."
54,2018-02-02,[''],So that hike is only good for if you want to go up a steep steep mile! The falls aren’t even falls! We were freakin lied too. I was deceived by the pictures that are featured. Those aren’t the falls. The falls featured are called Bridal Veil Falls. The water is barely trickling down the rocks.
55,2018-01-16,['hiking'],Super steep but great views. Rock Sofa at the top is a must! Fun short hike. Watch out for rattle snakes
56,2017-11-11,[''],"Kinda boring to be honest. It’s almost winter time, so come by on a Saturday to walk through the construction to get to the hike. The creek is pretty, but the falls at the end are literally water trickling down rock slower than my fridge puts out drinking water."
57,2017-10-18,[''],"Trail is currently closed due to some kind of construction and heavy machinery passing through, we were asked politely to leave and to spread the word."
58,2017-10-11,['hiking'],Good hike with a pretty steep hike up to the falls but it was well worth it.
59,2017-08-16,['camping'],"Beautiful but treacherous! We had a hard time finding the parking lot. We ended up parking at Nunn's park, taking Great Western Trail, and then going right where that trail ends. Keep walking until you see the graffiti shack and turn left. This does add some time but worth it if you can't find the parking. The beginning of the trail is steep, but don't let that disappoint you. Once you reach the river you mostly fall it up the whole way. The trail will end and you'll have to climb up the the river the rest of the way. It's unclear which waterfall is the ""one"". You can pretty much keep hiking until you're out of your comfort zone as it does get pretty steep and you're hiking up lose gravel. Be prepared for your shoes to get wet as you hobble across the river. Overall it was a great hike, definitely challenging at times...save your ankles and wear something supportive. Didn't see a single soul the whole 3 1/2 hrs it took."
60,2017-07-14,[''],"Absolutely the worst ""trail"" I've been on in Utah county. It's a steep incline most of the way, and looks like an old service road. You hear traffic and see graffiti on the way. This was anything but natural and peaceful. Ugly, boring, and did not pay off. Go somewhere else; there are so many more beautiful and fun options around! Skip this, unless you are with someone you don't like...then take them."
61,2017-07-05,['hiking'],"this was a fun little hike! it was hard to find at first. the trail head is a little dirt road RIGHT across from bridal veil falls. you have to pass bridal veil then make a U-turn. you have to go past the ""road closed""sign on for them about an 1/8 mile up, you see that shed in the pictures. Follow that road up the mountain. it's very steep here with little shade in the morning and early afternoon. You'll reach a point where there is a bit of a fork with a water hate to the right. Stay left with the trail. You will reach the river. it was flowing really well! once you get to the river, just stay along the river. the trail map says to cross it but that trail leads to nothing. just follow the trail up the river and there will be beautiful flowers are some cool falls coming off the cliffs. not very big, but still fun! 
This was a beautiful hole and we were the only ones on it (it's the Fourth of July!!!). the river keep the trail nice and cool once we reached it, and my 2 year old nephew has a lot of fun (riding on Dad's back). all in all we took about 2 hours to go up, have fun, come back down. I'd say the first part is really tough but once you reach the river, it's great!!! it's a great little hike for families and just getting back into shape."
62,2017-07-02,['hiking'],"To get to the bigger and prettier falls we had to scramble along the creek bed, which was a bit sketchy on the slippery rocks sometimes. Super fun. A challenge."
63,2017-06-23,['hiking'],The first time I tried it I was on the right path but then realized I wasn't following the trail as it's shown on AllTrails. So I went back down before reaching the falls only to be disappointed that the marked trail here just dead-ends. The second attempt I reached the falls. Lots of bouldering and loose rocks to reach the actual falls. The first attempt I only saw 4 other hikers as I was coming down. The second time I saw no one.
64,2017-06-19,[''],"Really nice hike...very quiet, no other hikers when we went...serene"
65,2017-06-03,['hiking'],"Lost Creek Falls is a short and steep day hike best left to experienced hikers. The parking area is not obvious, but hit ""DIRECTIONS"" from within the AllTrails app and then Google Maps will take you to the correct place. When you reach the turn in the trail (where it crosses the creek), instead of following the trail to a dead end, continue following the creek until you reach the falls or don't want to hike anymore. I reached a waterfall just above the 6068 contour line. Watch out for snakes! I encountered a massive one nearby the waterfall (see picture).

Also, if you do follow the trail where it bends, as suggested by the official route, you will find an impressive fire pit overlooking Bridal Veil Falls.

Overall, good hike. But if you are looking for a waterfall hike, I recommend more Bridal Veil Falls Trail for a short hike and Stewart Falls Trail for a longer hike."
66,2017-05-31,[''],great hike without a lot of people on the trail. starts steep but then as you walk up the river it becomes a gradual incline.  pretty creek to explore--no major waterfalls just lots of little falls.
67,2017-05-29,[''],"Loved it! Bring good hiking boots if you want to hike up the river to avoid bad ankle twists. I’ve hiked it twice now: once in May then again in July. The spring was better for this hike because the shrubs hadn’t overgrown too much yet, but summer was still very enjoyable too, just a lot harder to hike up with so much overgrowth."
68,2017-05-17,['hiking'],"The trail is somewhat short, steep, and undefined at times, but that can be a good thing. The waterfall at the top is way cooler than pictures can show, as the whole area near the top is full of falls and cool things. When we got to the falls we were past the red line on the map that turned to the right. To get to the falls just follow the creek until you get to the top."
69,2016-11-27,['hiking'],Took the family up here today and we loved it! It was steep but totally worth it. The creek was awesome. Not too cold yet either! We did feel like the hike could have ended once you get past the creek and to the little rock couch area. It's about 1.2 miles round trip that way. We hiked past it to the end and there wasn't much there and the trail is a bit washed away. The trailhead isn't marked but if you follow the map it's on the left hand side when you go up Provo Canyon. It's a small gravel road with a small dirt parking area. You just walk up the gravel road past the gate and head upwards once you see a small maintenance shack with graffiti all over it.
70,2016-11-11,['hiking'],
71,2016-10-09,[''],Couldn't find the trailhead. Pretty hike though!
72,2016-10-03,[''],"It's a straight up steep hike. Once you get up to the water it is fun to explore, but don't expect a good trail. It's still a lot of fun to explore. I'll definitely do it again except I want to see how high up the canyon I can go."
73,2016-08-29,['hiking'],I loved this hike totally worth going! just be prepared to take a sharp right off of the freeway at a high speed a rate lol
74,2016-08-11,['hiking'],this trail now appears to be a construction site. the trail has been ripped up by large construction equipment in order to fun el the creek into an underground pipe. only the last 300yrds or so of the original trail exist. the view of bridal falls is still very nice but hike up the dusty dirt road that's littered with construction equipment was not very nice...the hike was super fast so it may still be an option for someone who wants a quick under 45min hike with a decent view of bridal falls.
75,2016-07-15,['hiking'],"lots of fun!  a little rough on the ankles because you're hiking up a steeper stream for most of it, but very pretty and quite refreshing."
76,2016-06-30,['hiking'],"I didn't mind how steep it was, but I wasn't sure where the end was supposed to be, since the trail kind of disintegrates after you reach the creek. We found a cool little alcove in the rock farther up though, so that was fun."
77,2016-06-21,['hiking'],"Pretty steady incline til you reach the creek. Not too long though. I crossed over the creek to try and continue on a trail that was marked on the app and found the cute rock sofa fire pit area. The app said the trail continued on that way. If there ever was a trail there it is completely overgrown. I went as far as I could that way just walking through brush and found nothing at the end of the ""trail"". Headed back to the creek and decided to venture up stream. Definitely worth it! If I had someone else with me I probably would've kept going. It is absolutely gorgeous up there. Very secluded hike. I saw one person coming down on my way up and he said he had been the only one up at the creek. Also LOTS of big spiders crawling around the rocks while I was climbing up stream."
78,2016-06-13,[''],Me and my 11 year old boy did this trail!  It was So beautiful A little steeper than I expected but  a great little work out The waterfall was amazing!!!! Very recommended!!
79,2016-05-28,[''],"The trailhead is not marked and it was definitely more uphill than I was thinking after hitting Bridal Veil Falls, but nice hike."
80,2016-05-27,[''],Under the underpass on the Westside is small groups that crosses the river. Before the watershed fence is where the trailhead begins. The terrain is a little steep for an easy trail but it is well-developed and he's. The hike was a good heart-pumper for me and it's good that it was short. Enjoyed the creek but did want to cross it
81,2016-05-26,[''],nice quick hike!
82,2016-05-20,['hiking'],"I consider myself an average hiker.... this was a bit more than moderate for me. All uphill. Kudos to those who bring kids because it's not a very ""walkable"" trail once you get to the top area. Not to mention the snake hiding near the logs and rocks (so be careful!) "
83,2016-05-16,[''],It was a nice view but the hiking was steep over loose rocks. The terrain wasn't very fun to hike.
84,2016-05-10,[''],"Awesome views of Bridal Veil Falls.  A fun hike to do if you have an extra hour and want to get away from the crowds.  Definitely one I'll do again when I come back.  After walking on small trail up and around the watershed, you'll reach a larger trail.  Turn right and follow the larger trail for a couple hundred yards and you'll see a what looks like an ATV trail heading up the slope on the left.  Take it and it'll lead you straight to the falls!  I'm waiting until later this summer to explore further up the waterfall."
85,2016-05-07,['hiking'],"It was pretty near the top and very secluded, which was nice. The stream is really beautiful."
86,2015-08-26,['hiking'],Fun adventure if you're looking to avoid crowds and wanna try something different. I recommend starting from the parking lot above Nunn's park. The easiest way to get to it in my opiniion is if you walk across the little bridge that goes over Provo River before the overpass from that parking lot. There's a trail that comes off of it and takes you around a fenced off water shed area. Lots of climbing over rocks and some bushwacking but the waterfall is definitely worth checking out at least once. You can climb above it and keep going but I didn't explore it too far.
87,2015-08-25,['hiking'],Waterfall wasn't that exiting but short and fun!
88,2015-07-16,['hiking'],"It took us FOREVER to find the trailhead. It is directly across the highway from the bridal veil viewpoint lot. There is no sign, no parking lot, nada. We parked in a gravel turn out, and headed west down a gravel road, through a locked gate. Turn right at a little out building covered in graffiti. 

The first half mile is straight uphill, moderately steep and rocky. We hiked mid morning with kids ages 7-12, and it was HOT. The 7 year old had a hard time, but the others did okay. 

Once you get to the river, the trail sort of disappears. You can find bits and pieces along the river, but it's easier to just find your own way up the river. Bring walking sticks! Especially for kids. 

It was absolutely gorgeous. You can see bridal veil across the canyon. We didn't see a single other person on our hike. It was about a mile total from the trailhead to the falls at the top (with a small pool underneath). Getting to the pool was very tricky and we had to use our walking sticks to pull them up. 

Despite the difficulties, my 8 year old said it was the best hike he's ever been on :)"
89,2015-07-13,['hiking'],"This is one of the more scenic hikes that I have done in the area. One thing to note is that parts of the trail are very steep and the trail is very rocky. The upper portion of the trail is overgrown and sometimes impassible, forcing you to climb up the creek itself, so watch for wet slippery rocks as well. In mid July the falls were going pretty strong and there are views of bridal veil falls across the canyon as well."
90,2015-06-18,[''],be sure to turn right at the shack  so you don't start heading out of the canyon
