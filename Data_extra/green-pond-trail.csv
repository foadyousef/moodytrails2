1,2019-09-02,['hiking'],"This was such a great trail. I took my husband, 2 teens and my parents and we were all able to do it pretty effortlessly. My dad has bad knees and needed support on some of the rocky areas, but overall, we were all able to do it and had a great time. Very peaceful and serene. 
There is a section where there are hundreds of ferns that is breathtaking. Would definitely recommend. "
2,2019-08-26,['mountain biking'],Really enjoy riding this trail!
3,2019-08-23,['hiking'],This trail is closed August 22-24!!
4,2019-07-27,['hiking'],Did this trail on Pioneer Day. Great trail for pretty much the whole family. Just keep your eyes and ears open for mountain bikers. Overall very nice the wild flowers were still blooming so the colors were beautiful. 
5,2019-07-23,['hiking'],Very easy and kid friendly 
6,2019-07-18,['hiking'],"We did this 7.18.19 with our four kids. Easy and beautiful hike! We carried our baby on our backs and never felt unsafe or worried about falling or slipping. Our 4 year old was a little tired at the end, but overall it’s great! There were beautiful wildflowers and views. There were signs saying the trail will be closed 7/19-7/21 this year for a private race event. "
7,2019-07-15,['hiking'],Easy enough for a three year old—at least just to the pond. That’s as far as we got that day. Loved hiking it in early evening! But bring bug spray!
8,2019-07-06,['hiking'],This travel is as advertised. Mountain wildflowers in full bloom. Mountain bikers are very patient and courteous. Lots of people and a few dogs. We all got along great. Water available on the lower portion of the trail but since it’s a shorter out and back my two pals were fine. If you are in the area this trail is worth your time. I don’t recommend wearing sneakers or other soft sole shoes. Rugged surface with rocks boulders and fallen trees may get under foot. Sturdy boots mean your feet roll last longer too Incase you want to try adventuring further on the Needles trail or just hike one of dirt roads that spur off from the terminus of the main trail. 
9,2019-06-24,['hiking'],Very fun trail! 
10,2019-06-22,['hiking'],"Great gentle climb! Shade and sun mix. Mountain bikers do frequent the trial, but it’s easy to step aside in most areas. Nice views looking up to Snowbasin and out East across the valley."
11,2019-06-15,['hiking'],"Great easy hike for most. Trail was in great shape not muddy, or overgrown. Went for our first time with hubby 2 kids and a dog. We went in the afternoon and it was perfect, a friend went in the evening and said there were lots of bugs. "
12,2019-05-29,['muddy'],"Went with some friends, plus two kids (4 & 8 years old) and a dog. It was clearly marked, and not steep. Our biggest complaint was how muddy it currently is due to all the rain.

Will go back when it's had a chance to dry a bit."
13,2019-05-25,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Great trail for families and pets. Easy hike. Muddy right now due to spring run off. 
14,2019-04-27,['hiking'],very muddy right now but overall ok hiking!
15,2019-01-17,['hiking'],"Went there in January, without snowshoes we lasted about a mile. It was serene, looked like some folks went before us so we just followed their path until we couldn’t walk anymore without falling thigh deep into the snow. Would go again but with snowshoes."
16,2018-11-15,['hiking'],"We hiked this trail on September 5th and it was a beautiful fall hike. The trail was mostly dirt and it varied between loose and hard packed on the hike up. The lake was very pretty and we saw a mother moose with two calves drinking from the lake. While the trail doesn't have an official end to it, the views on the way up were amazing and I look forward to hiking this trail again."
17,2018-10-11,['hiking'],"My husband and I completed this hike with our Scout dog on September 29.  This is a nice, gently graded, easy-to-follow trail with some nice views.  My only complaint is that there wasn't an official ""end"" to the trail.  The trail itself kept going, but the app said that we had made it to the turn-around point.  

Other than that, it was a nice trail and the perfect day for hiking.  We even saw a moose near the lake."
18,2018-10-07,['hiking'],"Beautiful fall hike. Horses definitely present on the trail, as well as mountain bikes. Be careful if you’re hiking and kids are mountain biking - some curves don’t allow for much sight of pedestrians/bikes."
19,2018-09-22,[''],"Beautiful trail! Well managed. Perfect for families. I took a 3 yr old and 1 yr old in a backpack, it was perfect for us."
20,2018-09-11,['hiking'],Loved the red of the changing oak leaves and the bright yellow of the Aspens. There were lots of bikers but they were all kind and courteous.
21,2018-09-04,['hiking'],"Had an awesome trip. They were having a mountain bike race up Snowbasin, but we talked to a few couples walking out of the trail that said the race was on the other side of the pond, so we just took a quick trip to the pond and back. Had all four children with us (8,4,3,5weeks) so it was a good first time out. We’ll be back to hike the whole thing soon enough."
22,2018-08-13,['hiking'],"If you go soon after this is posted, BEWARE and read on. 
Great hike, especially for kids. One problem. We went yesterday, hiked up to the pond. We walked around the pond, which it seems like few do. The little trail is somewhat overgrown. We stumbled onto a ground nest of hornets right in the middle of the trail and they swarmed. Whole family got stung several times. As you walk up to the pond, the nest is along the right side (west). If you stay on the other side, I'm sure you'll be fine. It wasn't until we walked right up on it that we had trouble. They chased us for several hundred yards back down the trail. We passed a couple that was heading up, told them about it and they decided to go up anyway and got stung as well. Otherwise, this was a great hike — perfect for young children. Not too far, not too strenuous. Just right. That being said, I don't think I'll be able to get the kids to come back to it. Good story for them to tell though. Builds character."
23,2018-08-11,['hiking'],Nice trail. Some bikers acted very put out that they had to share the trail. Wasps at the pond.
24,2018-08-06,['hiking'],Beautiful hike for the family.  No restrooms but there is a nice pond at the picnic area.  Only a couple miles away from the Snowbasin Resort!
25,2018-08-05,[''],The trail is well marked easy hike however beware of the wasps that hang out by the pond!!
26,2018-07-08,[''],Great shaded hike. Kid friendly and easy for all.
27,2018-06-28,[''],"This was a really pretty trail, however it is not well marked. In order to actually see the pond, you need to go to the “Picnic Area”. There, you will see a nice view of the pond. If you go past that sign, you won’t really see the pond. It does lead to the ski trails which were pretty neat."
28,2018-06-23,[''],Beautiful trail!
29,2018-06-08,[''],"Hiked this trail with my 10yo & 7yo. Nice and easy little trail. Beautiful scenery, lots of shade and a well marked trail. Had a little picnic at the bench near the end of the trail. Was gone for about 2.5 hours."
30,2018-05-19,['walking'],"We often bring a huge group of kiddos with us ages a year to 14 and they’re all capable of walking, running, exploring and enjoying this trail. I’ve only ever been in the spring time and it’s always beautiful. The pond however has leeches so I would say no to letting any little feet in there or allowing your dog to play around in it. Depending on the day there can be lots of bikers."
31,2018-03-10,['hiking'],"Easy trail with amazing views!! The trail was almost entirely packed snow with some muddy areas. Still had good traction though, no need for the yak-tracks today"
32,2018-02-07,['hiking'],"The sunshine was bright and warm, the snow-covered trail was well-packed and crunchy (no snowshoes necessary), and the views were gorgeous.  We hiked to the picnic area and enjoyed a little afternoon snack.  Easy hike for the kids to a pretty snow-covered lake along a lovely little creek."
33,2018-01-10,['snowshoeing'],
34,2017-10-10,[''],Just beautiful and the fish were awesome.
35,2017-09-30,['hiking'],Loved the hike but the bikers ruined it for me! Easy trail and beautiful foliage.
36,2017-09-24,[''],Hiked this Sept 3 and it was beautiful!
37,2017-09-19,['hiking'],"Hiked this for the first time today. Beautiful views of the mountains in all directions. A mix of shade and sunny areas along the way. I stopped at the ""picnic area"" at the pond then decided to travel the ""Snowbasin trail #12"" until I reached a dirt road that crosses the path. The path continues on on the other side of the road but I decided not to push a knee that's been acting up so I turned around to head back. Almost got ran over by a mountain biker so couples with kids my advise is leave the kids home and hike this one by yourselves unless you want to constantly yank your kids out of the path of a cyclist. I will definitely try this hike further when my knee formula has more time to work it's magic on me."
38,2017-09-03,['mountain biking'],"Awesome. Allow yourself 2-3 hour to do the full ride-dont go in May, snow may not have melted! Bring water, snacks and extra clothes as it gets colder in later day."
39,2017-08-19,['hiking'],"Fun easy hike and very beautiful, but pond has leeches! I let my dogs play in the water and they came out with leeches. Beware!"
40,2017-08-04,['hiking'],"We should have read all of the reviews before we headed out. We thought the pond was the end destination and didn't realize the ""Picnic Area"" was it. It was a nice hike, though, and had good views at the top."
41,2017-07-09,[''],"Nice little trail for a family. Much less frequented than the popular trails in Big or Little Cottonwood Canyons. Be aware that there really is no destination at the top. The lake halfway through the hike is really the destination. At the top, the trail simply ends by meeting up with a dirt road frequented by mountain bikers."
42,2017-07-04,['hiking'],A beautiful hike. Lots of wildlife
43,2017-07-04,[''],"Fun, easy hike. The kids had a good time and the pond was a pretty place to stop and eat. Lots of mountain bike traffic. They were polite and respectful."
44,2017-07-02,['hiking'],Nice trail to a pretty pond up by Snowbasin.
45,2017-06-15,['hiking'],
46,2017-06-05,[''],Mountain Bike Scheisters have consumed the trail. Was almost taken out by two cyclists today. Hikers recommend you avoid the trail on weekends. Watch your kids.
47,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"The hike is absolutely beautiful in the late spring with the flowers & sunshine. Mixed use so be prepared for the MTB-ers. Trailhead can be confusing. Park and cross the road (go uphill) to see the pond. Less than a mile to get to it. You must take the ""Picnic Area"" spur. Hope that helps!"
48,2017-05-28,['hiking'],Took the 3 kids and it's a great hike for the family :)
49,2017-05-09,['hiking'],"A nice, easy hike. Exactly the spring evening mountain get-away hike that I needed. It was a little muddy from all the snow melt and recent rain but worth it."
50,2017-05-07,[''],"Great mtn biking trail, a little rocky."
51,2016-12-20,[''],Great winter trail. We had toddlers and they enjoyed the powder! Not too steep or icy today.
52,2016-12-13,[''],"Great trail, awesome for biking."
53,2016-09-06,['walking'],"Easy trail, pretty scenery, perfect for a Sunday afternoon walk. This is good for kids, as well. There were many people and lots of mountain bikes. Most people riding their bikes were polite, but a few were quite rude."
54,2016-07-31,['hiking'],"Great hike. Very gradual incline. Not to hard for our 3 kids. Lots of mountain bike traffic, but we didn't mind."
55,2016-07-31,['hiking'],"Great little hike, not difficult at all, although it is rocky in certain areas and you share the trail with mountain bikers. Usually we park on Snowbasin road (by the Wheeler trailhead and walk across the street to the Green Pond trailhead. At the end of Green Pond we connect up with the #12 Snowbasin trail which will run you back to the Green Pond trail and back to the road, making a nice 4.5 mile loop. We try to hit the pond on our way out, usually as a time to rest and eat a little before going home. Have fun, it's a great little hike!"
56,2016-07-04,['hiking'],"This is a family favorite.  Beautiful, cool air, typically not crowded and has a picnic table by the pond.  Little kids can easily do this."
57,2016-04-08,['hiking'],I took my kids ages 8 and 10 on this hike.  It is not difficult and is pretty.  We parked at the point where the Old Snow Basin road is closed and hiked to Green pond.  It was 2.75 miles each direction.  There are also closer places to park to hike to the pond as well.
58,2015-11-14,['hiking'],A fun area to hike and the pond along the way is a great place to picnic.  I have been up here many times hiking and geocaching.  This is a very busy area for biking so be aware of your surroundings.
