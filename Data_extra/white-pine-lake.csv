1,2019-09-02,['backpacking'],Was Beutiful and not that bad. The last mile into white pine in a little rough if you don’t backpack a lot. And coming out is a little worse. But other than that it was awesome the Entire way. With breathtaking views once you get to white pine. 
2,2019-08-25,['hiking'],"Great hike! Beautiful views! We missed the peak of beautiful flowers by a week or 2 but there were enough left to make it worth it. There were some steep sections of the trail but enough flat sections to give us relief. Our reward at the end was a gorgeous lake surrounded by majestic, steep 1,000 foot, limestone cliffs (our best estimate)!"

4,2019-08-19,['hiking'],"Loved it! Beautiful views. Surprised to see a dozen cows grazing. Crossed the creek a few times. 6:30-9:30 am on Monday morning, late August- no other hikers. 
Took us 80 min to get to the lake. Spent 20 min there. Took us 80 min to return. But we move quick. 
The first half of the return is the steepest!
Great trails. Marked well. "
5,2019-08-11,['hiking'],"Great hike, I really enjoyed it.  The lake is definitely not a letdown once you get there, quite the opposite.  Very scenic.  There were a good number of people mildly complaining about having to hike back up from the lake before the trail drops back to Tony Grove.  I did, too.  It's nothing bad.  The high point is 8,800 ft, so maybe the altitude was getting some of us a bit.  Still, it's a great hike and well worth it, I absolutely will do it again.  Coming back to Tony Grove, you couldn't ask for better trail conditions.  After the high point, it's downhill to you can step it out and make good time on the return. 
 It's not steep enough to be hard on knees and ankles, it really is just about the ideal slope.  

One thing:  I don't understand the reviewer who stated that there's very little shade.  It's alpine forest, there's shade everywhere.  In most places, just step 4 feet off the trail and you're in shade.  If you're in an open area, shade is never more than a couple hundred yards away."
6,2019-08-10,['hiking'],Great hike and camping spot. Steeper coming back
7,2019-08-09,['hiking'],"Super scenic, not too long, and minimal elevation gain. I made a video of the scenery here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcFkZHVr9pQ"
8,2019-08-05,['hiking'],"Fantastic hike. The views were great, and it was easy to find. The roads leading to it are very maintained, and everything is well marked. A decent amount of shade cover. Only one very steep section. Wouldn’t recommend for biking unless very very experienced. We completed it in around 3.5 hours. "
9,2019-08-04,['hiking'],"This is a pretty great trail!! There isn’t much shade though, so you might want to A) hike it in the fall when it’s cooler. B) leave really early in the morning C) go backpacking up there in the morning when it’s still cool, and then set up camp and go swimming in the lake. There are multiple fire pits and places to hang hammocks or put up tents up there so you could then stay the night and hike out the next morning. This is definitely a trail you’ll want to try though. It reminds me of the Tetons. The lake is absolutely gorgeous."
10,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'rocky']",
11,2019-07-25,['hiking'],Awesome but very little shade. Much cooler temps though so it didn’t bother us!
12,2019-07-23,['hiking'],The flowers are looking so good right now!
13,2019-07-22,['hiking'],"Wonderful Trail, a little bit of descent and climbing but nothing outside a ""moderate"" level. Plus so many wildflowers this time of the year!! There's plenty of shade but also definitely a lot of sun. "
14,2019-07-22,['backpacking'],"got to the trailhead at about 16:00.  The parking was starting to clear from the Saturday Tony Grove day users.  Parking is $7 cash or check.  I tend to be a slow hiker, but I made it to the lake just before 19:00, set up camp and enjoyed dinner with a beautiful sunset. Overnight, it was a bit chillier than I had expected, which left me wishing I had restocked the hand warmers in my pack.  I packed up and hit the trail back on Sunday, again taking it slow and enjoying the amazing views. I made it back to the car in about 2.5 hrs.  splendid trip. "
15,2019-07-17,['hiking'],"Great trail. Based on my gps, it ended up being about 4 miles in and 4 miles out. If you go up on a weekend, I’d suggest going early, as the parking lot fills up quickly. We had to wait a few minutes for a spot to open up. But the trail was fantastic and views were gorgeous!"
16,2019-07-15,"['backpacking', 'muddy']","This was a beautiful trail and perfect for backpacking in. Unfortunately we got stuck in a rainstorm about 2.5 miles in there was only hill to set up camp, but we did and waiting out the storm. Once it was over we packed up and made it to the lake. It was beautiful and worth it!  There are great camping spots, but a lot so close to the trail. If you look more there are some further off the trail. "
17,2019-07-14,['trail running'],trail has a little bit of water on it. otherwise great
18,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes in Utah. Gorgeous meadows, gradual elevation gain, tons of panoramic views, the lake is also outstanding. Lots of good spots to camp near the lake. Set up a hammock and took a nice lunch. The way back from the lake is a little bit steeper than the way in but definitely manageable. The weather snuck up on us quickly so I’d recommend always having a jacket. Even in July it got cold fast. "
19,2019-07-04,['hiking'],"Still a little bit of snow in a couple spots on the trail, but definitely manageable. We tried biking it and had a blast! It’s a pretty difficult ride. I would suggest hiking it for most people. "
20,2019-06-29,['hiking'],good as usual
21,2019-06-29,"['camping', 'bugs', 'muddy', 'snow']","Trail conditions were excellent (June 29 and 30, 2019). Nobody with appropriate footwear will have any problems with the small amounts of snow still on parts the trail or the mud that the melt has created. Campsites at White Pine Lake are clear and free of snow and mud, although there are still patches of snow between campsites. Plenty of running water for purifying/pumping. Hordes of Boy Scouts have ensured firewood is pretty sparse around the campsites, but there's tons of fallen deadwood along the trail on the way in. Bringing a hatchet or camp saw will make getting wood pretty easy. Mosquitos, flies, and insects of all sorts are out in full force, so bring bug spray!"
22,2019-06-26,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",
23,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']",Hiked this with my brother this afternoon. (6/21/19) We’ve both been before and loved it. It a bit earlier in the season so lots of snow but we were able to make it all the way back to the lake without our feet getting too wet. If you go this early the trail isn’t always visible so I’d recommend making sure you have the app open so you can make sure you’re headed in the right place.
24,2019-06-19,['hiking'],My all time favorite trail!
25,2019-06-15,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","The parking lot is accessible now. Still a lot of snow on the trail in places. We got almost to White Pine Lake, but turned around because we had traveled along ways through the snow already. We will be back to complete this trail as soon as it is melted and less muddy from all of the snow melt. Naomi Peak Trail is still covered in snow as well. Trails are possible right now with snowshoes."
26,2019-06-10,[''],"A great trail, but the road is still snow covered with no access to the parking lot today on (6/8/19). So maybe come back in a few weeks to experience this beauty! "
27,2019-05-10,['hiking'],"Very pretty and a nice spot for an overnight backpacking trip at the lake. 
If you want to stay 2 nights, I recommend heading back up the trail and all the way up to Mt Naomi. 
Both trails are fairly popular but we have always found a nice spot by the lake to set up tents!"
28,2019-05-09,['hiking'],"Did this hike yesterday (6.24.19). Absolutely gorgeous and stunning all around. There is still quite a bit of snow and mud to get through, so my boots were totally soaked. But it was absolutely worth it. 
Got lost at one spot where the trail takes a turn (right) and descends down the mountain. I think it is the steepest descent. The app helped find my way back to the trail. The White Pine Lake is gorgeous! Wish I could stay there longer. "
29,2019-04-10,['fishing'],"Pretty nice trail. Used quite frequently so you won’t get lost. The fishing down there at least on dry files or streamers is fantastic; the Brook Trout hit and fight hard and are really pretty. The only problem is that the hike back to Tony Grove is a little bit difficult. Anything but that, it’s worth it for the fishing."
30,2018-09-16,['hiking'],One of my favorite hiking spots.  The scenery is amazing!
31,2018-09-10,[''],Hiked it with my 2.5 year old and some friends it was amazing! A few sources of water along the way and peaceful.
32,2018-09-10,[''],"Hiked this yesterday with my daughter. The climb out was pretty strenuous. But, well worth it. Very beautiful."
33,2018-09-08,['hiking'],"Very nice trail.  Elevation gains aren’t too bad. The hardest Park is coming back up through the switch backs in the fir forest right before you get to the lake.  Beautiful views. The trail is actually 8.2 miles according to my gps, if that matters. Trail is clearly marked.  Bring plenty of water/ sunscreen and hat if doing a day hike because there are large portions of the trail with no shade.  Great/little hike!  The gps took us to wrong place. Just follow Tony Grove rd all the way to the end. It was $7.00 to park."
34,2018-09-06,[''],We had the whole hike and lake to ourselves. It was beautiful
35,2018-09-02,[''],pretty easy trail between 7.5-8 miles. mostly flat. the hardest part is going back up once you get to the lake! there were TONS of cows and sheep everywhere though so watch out 
36,2018-08-19,['hiking'],"Went for a quick morning hike, great trail, lake is beautiful! Paved road to nice parking lot."
37,2018-08-18,[''],"The spectacular wildflowers and lovely lake at the end of the trail make this one a ""must do"".  Went on a Saturday, and had lots of company.  Low on solitude, but high on friendly people enjoying Mother Nature's gifts"
38,2018-08-13,['backpacking'],A great 1 or 2 day backpacking adventure! My wife and I did a 2 day trip 20 years ago and I just took 2 of my kids (wife was nice enough to stay back with the younger kids). Great wildflowers and not too difficult with a pack. Don't count on fish for dinner as they seem to be picky. This area seems surprisingly popular for fishing 4 miles in.
39,2018-08-08,['backpacking'],Backpacked to this beautiful spot. Worth it.
40,2018-08-05,[''],"Backpacked this trail with a group of 12, ranging in age from 11 yrs old to 50, and was a nice variety of difficulty for all. Enjoyed the campground and cooler/cleaner air. Plenty of trees for setting up hammocks as half the group opted to do that. Plan on 2 hrs each way. Many wild flowers, but a couple weeks sooner would've been better. Overall, great hike."
41,2018-07-29,[''],"What a fantastic backpacking trail to take four young teenaged grandkids. We had a wonderful two days and a great hike. The weather is fantastic in July, I was even too warm for sleeping!"
42,2018-07-27,[''],Only one hill on the way back but otherwise an easy and beautiful hike. Surprised at all the wildflowers. Lake is really pretty.
43,2018-07-24,[''],"This was a good, moderate hike in length and difficulty. The flowers were beautiful! Would be a fun place to hike in and camp overnight."
44,2018-07-23,['hiking'],"Awesome hike! Did on a weeknight and had the trail primarily to ourselves. Not too tough, great views and great little campgrounds near White Pine Lake. Definitely need to do it again and stay overnight!"
45,2018-07-22,[''],Good hike for those looking for a mix between easy but worthwhile. Great hike to go on with friends. Gone about three separate times myself. Never a dull moment.
46,2018-07-14,[''],The wildflowers on this trail are beautiful! The lake itself is a great payoff from this fairly short and sweet hike. This trail is one of the gems of Logan Canyon!
47,2018-07-10,[''],"This is a Goldilocks Trail - just the right distance, hard but not too hard, and a great mix of sun and shade. But most of all it was the wildflowers. Oh the wildflowers.  Just breathtaking."
48,2018-07-07,[''],Awesome quick day hike/run on our way from SLC to bear lake and beyond. The wild flowers are beautiful! Reminded us of Alta meets the Tusher mountains. Saw some families back packing would be a great long day/over night trip for kids. We were pleased with this adventure it was Beautiful!
49,2018-07-07,[''],This was a great over night for us. My 5 and 2 year old girls loved it. Flowers of all colors everywhere. Peaks above lake are awesome. Not a lot of bugs. I’d give it a 4 if the lake was one you wanted to jump into after a hike and if the trail was less busy. When we hiked in at 6 pm it wasn’t bad but the campground was busy and hiking out the trail was very busy. Still probably my favorite hike in logan canyon.
50,2018-07-07,['hiking'],This is a great hike for families.  Our 8 & 6 year olds did it no problem.  Easy trail and amazing scenery.  Definitely one of our favorites.
51,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"Awesome trail. $7 to park at Tony Grove Lake, but well worth the 90 minute hike to White Pine Lake.  Our Fitbits had us at about 4.05 miles from parking lot to white pine lake.  

The trail wasn’t busy at all, white pine has a handful of dispersed camping sites near the lake. Seemed like a great place to hike out, set up camp and enjoy some peace and quite for a weekend, or however long!"
52,2018-07-06,['hiking'],Well maintained. Not too crowded. Beautiful views.
53,2018-07-04,['hiking'],Excellent hike taking about 90 minutes in and a little more out. The steepness of the back portion of the hike is a little challenge but overall it is a beautiful experience.
54,2018-06-30,[''],"Excellent for kids. Took my 8YO, wished that I had my 6YO as well.  You give up a fair amount of elevation over the last 1.5-ish miles, which means on the hike back out you start with a pretty good climb.

The fee at the trailhead is $7/day and on a weekend they are there collecting. 

If you go on a summer Friday or Saturday plan on sharing the trail with multiple scout troops and horse parties."
55,2018-06-20,[''],One of best hikes I have ever done in Utah
56,2018-06-18,['backpacking'],"If you are an experienced hiker you will find this a pretty easy hike. The only significant elevation is at the beginning and then as you descend to the lake then ascend back. My GPS tracked exactly 4 miles to the lake with a little campground exploration. The views are stunning, birds singing everywhere, but really, if you lived in a place like this, you'd sing too!
We back packed in and it took 2 hours with several stops for pictures, a blister first aid, and drinks. Busy trail but except for the horse poop, it's very pristine. Hikers are taking care to keep it clean. If you come later in the evening on a weekend you might have a hard time finding a camp spot. We arrived at 6:30 and there were several to choose from. We saw only two other groups. But by dusk the place was packed.
Really no firewood unless you go hunt for it and even then a hatchet will be your friend. We found plenty, but it took four of us to go search away from the area both night and morning.
Hardly any bugs, that may change as the summer progresses.
Honestly doesn't get much better than this.
Pack out whatever you pack in!"
57,2018-06-10,[''],"Great!! Very beautiful hike with more flat hike. Hardest part was the return going back up from the lake, but after that pretty moderate in difficulty."
58,2018-06-10,['backpacking'],"Beautiful start to finish.  Steady uphill grade to the ridge crosses several alpine streams with spectacular Rocky Mountain Vistas.  Getting used to the altitude was my biggest challenge.  Over the ridge and a series of switchbacks down the other side followed by a steady downhill grade to the lake.  Ridiculously beautiful  mountain setting for White Pine Lake.  Because this location is heavily visited, fire wood is a challenge to find.  Suggest backpack food.  Caught several brook Trout.  Tons of fun fishing.  Next morning body was was good with the altitude which made hike out of there much better.  Don't underestimate this hike.  By the time you get back to Tony's Grove Lake you will be thrashed - but glad you went."
59,2018-05-04,['backpacking'],"Great trail to take a beginning backpacker. Its easy, beautiful and short. I like to do it at least once a year as a short fun weekend trip."
60,2018-02-18,[''],"Camping under mount Magog in the wildflowers was awesome! The lake is pretty neat and we saw some deer at dusk. Lots of good campsites, had no trouble finding one in July."
61,2017-10-19,[''],I have been hiking this with my kids for the last 3 years (they are 9 and 10 now) it is so worth the hike. It's a pretty easy hike with only part of it being intense.
62,2017-09-27,['hiking'],"I drive up to Tony Grove to backpack this trail every fall. It's a beautiful drive and a very easy hike. If you get here at the right time, the aspens are all yellow and look outstanding! Descending down to the lake is fun and there are quite a few spots to camp."
63,2017-09-13,['hiking'],Perfect moderation. And the road was amazing up to the trailhead so my old car didn't have a problem.
64,2017-09-02,[''],"An easy, beautiful hike!"
65,2017-08-31,['hiking'],"loved this beautiful hike.  some bikers,  couple horses but mostly back packers. parking lot gets busy but beautiful lake and hike."
66,2017-08-11,[''],"Took the horses last fall, the leaves were stunning.  It's a good trail for the horses.   The last little bit going down to the lake are some switchbacks where we ran into some tight passing with hikers.   I'm looking forward to going again and maybe trying to access from Franklin Basin."
67,2017-07-31,['hiking'],"This was a very beautiful hike.  It's been on my list for several months now. lots of scenic wildflowers and nature.  On the down side,  it was extremely busy with people hiking,  horseback riding,  and biking.  There were those that left there animal waste on the trail."
68,2017-07-27,['backpacking'],"Such a beautiful hike with wildflowers everywhere! We back-packed later in the afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. The next day we hiked out around noon and there were tons of people hiking in, plus it was extremely hot! I do suggest either hiking in the early morning or later in the day to avoid congestion on the trail and to not sweat to death."
69,2017-07-26,['hiking'],"Mostly exposed to the sun, so can get hot and sunburn. Elevation change is modest. There are a couple of meadows along the way, which are full of wild flowers in the summer. The lake is pretty and rewarding.

Can get really crowded."
70,2017-07-18,[''],"We love this hike and have done it several times. Expect snow in early June, we lost the trail under snow a couple times before when in snow. so beautiful and peaceful."
71,2017-07-17,['hiking'],"Great hike, saw a moose. Plan on paying $6 for parking"
72,2017-07-17,[''],This hike is beautiful.
73,2017-07-15,['hiking'],Good hike for a nice Saturday. Start early to avoid crowds and bring sunscreen to avoid looking like a lobster.
74,2017-07-14,[''],Loved the meadows filled with wildflowers.
75,2017-07-14,['backpacking'],"A beautiful hike filled with rolling hills, aspen groves, jaw dropping cliffs, wildflowers, streams, and alpine lakes."
76,2017-07-13,[''],"Beautiful hike in with awesome scenery and a most impressive mountain surrounded lake at the end!! The switch backs were a little rough on the way out, but all in all a great hike!!!"
77,2017-07-09,['hiking'],Hiked this trail today on the 4th of July. Our Corgi made the whole way just fine with some rests. There's still some snow up there but it actually helps you get over the muddy spots. Once you get about 0.9 miles from the lake the trail forks. Take the higher fork up towards the campgrounds -- the other way is super muddy. Overall fun hike with lots of incline on the way back! We ran up it to get it over with faster.
78,2017-07-09,['backpacking'],"I thought that this was a lovely little hike. We took kids and they found it challenging but manageable. White Pine Lake is awesome, a great little fishing spot. We had to pack in quite a bit of water, because we didn't know if there was any down there, and it was a good thing we did, because we never found any. It was pretty crowded on a Friday night, so I'd avoid the weekends, but other than that, it was incredible!"
79,2017-07-04,['hiking'],This was a pretty easy trail. Lots of wild flowers and cool scenery. The incline wasn't bad at all. Lot of people on the trail today. We were glad we went early in the morning. The lake and scenery are worth the effort. Will definitely need to backpack in and spend a night or two at the lake.
80,2017-07-01,[''],"A beautiful hike. Gorgeous mountains, beautiful streams and Brooks, majestic trees and skylines.  This certainly is not a challenging hike but there are aspects of it that will definitely get your heart pumping and lungs expanding. The trail is very well used, easy to follow, and fairly safe. Little children would find this difficult as well as older people. So please use caution with the little ones. If you explore around the lake a little you will definitely be hiking a good 8 miles. This distance is a round trip distance. We hiked on July 1 and there were plenty of small snowfields along the way that were melting. This caused some muddy trails, which can be slippery so good hiking boots would be advised."
81,2017-06-27,[''],Best hike in Logan Canyon
82,2017-06-22,['hiking'],"Hiked 2 miles in before I saw a fresh bear track so I hightailed it back to my car.  Will try again with a buddy and bear spray later.  There were two huge snow fields (20+ minutes each) so I had to use GPS.  Crampons would've been nice.  Hiking sticks helped with the snow and two water crossings since the spring runoff was still a little strong.  Again, I would've been stubborn and made it had I not seen that bear track but I'm not stupid - I don't take on bears solo."
83,2017-06-17,['hiking'],Amazing hike. Still snow to this date. We where not able to make it to the lake because of the steep and snowy descent to it. Quite dangerous without the proper gear.
84,2017-05-27,['hiking'],"Just got done attempting this hike, I wanted to post this review to share that everything is still snowed in down to the Tony Grove gate (about 1 mile from Tony Grove Lake). Looks like it would have been an impeccable hike though."
85,2017-03-31,[''],love this hike. the only issue is it can get extremely busy.
86,2017-02-27,['backpacking'],Nice day hike. We hiked this in mid June. Trail wasn't very busy but the campgrounds around the lake was fairly full.
87,2017-02-04,['hiking'],"Favorite day hike, there's camping however its busy,"
88,2016-10-30,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes ever. The lake is pristine & gorgeous, and trail was well maintained. Switchbacks made it a good workout."
89,2016-10-10,[''],"Parts of the trail were very muddy. Other than that, this trail was amazing and so was the view at the end."
90,2016-09-26,['hiking'],"A (semi)hidden gem.  I checked it out via Google Earth and was concerned the trail wouldn't always be visible, but it is well worn and obvious"
91,2016-09-08,['hiking'],Favorite trail in Logan Canyon
92,2016-08-09,[''],Beautiful trail. Packed in on a Saturday and only one other couple around. Had the lake to ourselves. Got a major lightning/thunderstorm that did not produce rain but was amazing to watch/listen to. Well used trail. Steep descent into the lake the last 1.5 miles.
93,2016-08-05,['backpacking'],"Stayed for 2 nights and went in a little too heavy, but destination made it worth while    A few too many people, but it was a holiday weekend.  And people please don't pull branches off live trees for firewood when there is a ton of dead fall 5 min away."
94,2016-07-30,['hiking'],Great!
95,2016-07-22,[''],Love this hike no matter the time of year!
96,2016-07-17,['backpacking'],"Absolutely beautiful, the steep switch backs to get down to the lake can be a bit treacherous for kids but overall an amazing hike."
97,2016-07-12,[''],The wild flowers at the beginning of the trail are stunning in early to mid July! The trail begins with a open area for about three quarters of a mile before you get into the trees and then it is mostly shade! When you get within a mile and a half of the lake the trail drops down into the lake so coming out is the steepest part of the trail for about a mile and a half.  Then it levels off and is easy most of the way. The lake is Beautiful and is surrounded on two sides by majestic cliffs that enhance the beauty of the area! White pine lake is a must do hike for hiking lovers in the Cache Valley area! Keep in mind there is a user fee per vehicle at the trailhead near the Tony Grove lake.
98,2016-07-10,['hiking'],"Beautiful trail, pretty lake.  Fairly heavy traffic, with a bunch of screaming 10 year olds at the lake.  Not sure if that's a regular occurrence, but if so, might take it down to three stars.  Without the screaming kids, 5 stars."
99,2016-07-10,['hiking'],Loved the whole hike. The lake was great and the wild flowers were beautiful.
100,2016-07-03,['hiking'],Great hike! But also a really fun bike ride to connect on to bunch grass.
101,2016-06-29,['hiking'],"The lake is definitely worth the hike. Gorgeous! We saw a moose in the water and that was a treat. It is a longer hike, 7.4 miles total with an initial gradual elevation gain, then steeper down hill to reach the lake (and then back again). Take extra water and a light snack. There is a ground fed stream that feeds into the lake and we replenished our water. Not sure yet if we will regret it, but it seemed safe."

103,2016-06-26,['backpacking'],Super gorgeous!
104,2016-06-25,['hiking'],Beautiful weather. Lots of wildlife. The stream crossings were easy and not muddy at all.
105,2016-06-22,['backpacking'],What an amazing hike. The scenery is amazing and absolutely breathtaking. Truly worth the effort to see it.
106,2016-06-21,['hiking'],"Great hike, weather was fabulous, periodic shady pines and aspens really helped break the heat. Snowpack melting and only encountered a few areas that you had to walk on water or muck. Nothing impassable. Hiking down to the lake is steep but not too difficult, as I was heading down there were families with young children coming up (4-10 year olds). Took about 3-4 hrs to hike out and back."
107,2016-06-15,['hiking'],Are the switchbacks still covered in snow?
108,2016-06-12,['backpacking'],This is a great trail. It is a fun backpacking trip that you can easily go over a short weekend. The wild flowers are also an amazing sight.
109,2016-06-08,[''],Extremely beautiful and not crowded at all! LOVE!
110,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"Proposed to my wife at this lake, could anything be any better, of course you should go"
111,2016-05-16,['hiking'],"I try to do this hike at least once a year, I even mountain biked it once.  I would not recommend it as a mountain bike trail for the average joe.  If you are a mountain biker with a nice, expensive, fancy bike then go for it.  

As a hike, it starts fairly intense then evens out to a steady, manageable incline.  Then the drop in to the lake is drastic and steep.  

The lake is gorgeous, clean, and cold.  Then you get to hike out.... and that initial climb out is a killer, especially if you are out-and-back.  But then it's downhill the rest of the way out.  

I don't think this is a kid friendly trail, at least under 10 due to the length and the steep climb out.   

This hike has it all.  Meadows, in the trees, a lake..."
112,2016-05-12,[''],One of our family's favorites. beautiful and so peaceful. Our dog also loves it. do be aware there can be snow through June.
113,2015-08-14,['hiking'],"seriously the best place to back pack in the whole county. This is an amazing hike, the mountain and the lake are so scenic. The wild life is very present. and you can explore the area for quite some time. the walls that surround the little valley you're in are spotted with caves and rock climbing oppurtunities. if you are in this area this hike is a must."
114,2015-08-13,['hiking'],"Took my Scouts backpacking here this summer. It is a great trail to introduce backpacking to younger kids. The trail in is moderate with a slight, steady incline almost the whole way in. The downhill trek to the lake at the end is a bit steep, but still easy to handle even with a full load. The scenery is off the charts and there is always plenty of wildlife to view."
115,2015-07-26,['hiking'],"Soooo good! I saw horses, cows, and even two llamas on this trail!!!"
116,2015-07-08,[''],Awesome!!!!!
117,2015-07-05,['bird watching'],"Awesome trail, it's about 9547 foot high, it's good hiking (2910 meters) took me 3:30 hrs to reach the high point and enjoy the view and the lake with wild life up there. Go, it's nice."
118,2015-07-01,[''],Great!
119,2015-06-30,['hiking'],"Backpacked this with my 7 and 5 year-old kids 6/26/15. Beautiful hike, nice trail, and easy enough for children. This is a great beginner trail for backpacking. The campsites are well-kept and there is a pot toilet to the north of the lake. Distance is inaccurate - round trip is 7.4 miles (GPS-measured). The only visible snow was on the north face of Mt. Magog."
120,2015-06-21,['hiking'],"Hiked this in Late June 2015, light snow patches on the side towards the lake. Saw a moose off the trail as well. Last mile to the lake is a little strenuous. Very beautiful scenery."
121,2015-05-28,['walking'],"This is a very lovely trail with much to see. Hikers will cross beautiful meadows, move through pine forests and end up at a pretty lake. There are a profusion of wild flowers here all summer long."
122,2015-04-11,['hiking'],"One of my top 5 hikes (so far). Although there's a thigh burning sections and sea level folks my struggle with breath a bit this hike is so worth the time and effort. Most of it is quite easy and extremely beautiful. We hit this up in late June and were surrounded by blue skies, meadow of green grasses and colorful wildflowers. Many great spots to picnic along the lake as well as tent camping sites so you can stay longer and really enjoy the mountain air. I can't recommend this trail enough."
123,2015-04-07,['hiking'],"This is my favorite trail to hike in the Bear River Range. The hike is nice and easy, and can be done pretty quickly, but it's best to go overnight, because, what's better than sleeping close to a gorgeous mountain lake?"
124,2014-06-21,['hiking'],"I've done this hike a couple of different times. The first time was when I was younger and went backpacking/camping with my Boy Scout troop. The second time I rode my mountain bike. Both were a lot of fun, and the lake at the end of the trail is a good reward for the effort."
125,2013-07-17,['hiking'],This trail is beautiful!!! The views are amazing. The altitude gain is pretty serious & the last mile is straight up & extremly rocky. I wish I hadnt hustled up so fast because I was hurting on the way down!!
126,2012-09-02,['fishing'],"For me on this trail it has been a couple of years since I walked this.  It is a relaxing walk but when you get to the part of the trail where you have to go down the side of the hill (and up to go back) it is a bit tireing if you don't take it slow either way, overall though it is a good trail to go on and the lake is worth the walk to as well.  Very beautiful scenery there."
127,2012-08-25,['camping'],Had a great time backpacking. Nice cool evening and fun time at the lake the next day. Fishing was good with a spoon.
128,2012-07-08,['hiking'],Loved it! Great spot to rest and have lunch. Fields of flowers everywhere.  It was absolutely gorgeous! The lake was very pretty.
129,2012-04-21,['hiking'],The best family hike around. We have done thee times and plan to do it many more times. We have always done over nighters. Easy hike if your are in good health and you buy the right gear. 
130,2011-07-21,['hiking'],Just spent 2 days backpacking and camping in the area. Tried to go to High Creek lake the first night but the snow stopped us at the base of Mt. Naomi. Found a clear spot to camp and left the next morning to White Pine lake.  It was a great hike however the place is very popular even with all the snow.  I was a little surprised at how many beer cans and other random trash people leave down there.  If you can pack it in you can pack it out. Other than that the surrounding mountains are absolutely beautiful!
