0,2019-09-05,['hiking'],"Great trail with awesome views of the Great Salt Lake including amazing sunsets.  It is an easy, winding and gradual assent and I would rate this as an easy trail open to all ability levels.  There are benches along the way where you can sit and rest if needed.  It is a multi use trail shared with mountain bikes so be alert and share the space.  The signage can be confusing as some routes down the mountain are designated for mountain bikes only.  Check the map at the trailhead and familiarize yourself with these routes as the signs on the trail are not as clear as they could be. The trail is probably 30% shaded with the rest of the trail in the open so it can get hot. Bring a hat and water based on the sun exposure when you go.  There is parking and a seasonal bathroom at the trailhead as well as a group shelter if you need a place to meet your hiking friends.  Give it a try! "

2,2019-08-28,['hiking'],"Loved this short little hike! It’s a great trail to stroll while getting gorgeous views of the valley the whole way up. Obviously most of the flowers aren’t blooming this time of year, but there were still quite a few. Great for all ages and fitness levels. Will definitely be doing again."
3,2019-08-15,['hiking'],nice easy walk...great weekday hike 
4,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'no shade']","I like hiking in this area because the views are gorgeous. That being said, there is not much shade on this trail, and I ended up taking the shortcut back to trailhead because I just needed to get out of the sun. This is a relatively short hike with just enough inclines to get your heart pumping. I didn't have any issues with bugs and while the trail is narrow, I wouldn't consider it overgrown."

"
7,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']",Super pretty trail that presents beautiful views of the valley. Very buggy and a bit overgrown.
8,2019-07-19,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
9,2019-07-17,['hiking'],"This hike was easy and doable for all ages. Dogs are also welcomed. Be careful with bikers though. They are EVERYWHERE and they are coming in fast! Also, the trail was very confusing on what was and what wasn’t the primary hike trail. Make sure you read the signs! They are lots of help! "
10,2019-07-07,[''],this trail is in the backyard of a residential area. excellent view of 4th of July celebration. parking is limited. lots of traffic on the way out of the residential area. 
11,2019-06-29,['hiking'],beautiful hike!
12,2019-06-24,['hiking'],"Fun hike with kids. I did the Wild Rose Loop trail with my kids 10, 8, 4 and 2.5 in a backpack although I think my 2.5 year old could do this trail, it was just for convenience. Took about 1.5 hours to do the 2 mile loop at a very leisurely pace and a few stops to look at the valley, could probably do this in 40 minutes if motivated. "
13,2019-06-16,['hiking'],"This was a really fun trail. We took the kids and the dogs and they had fun but we probably should have brought a little more water for the dogs since we didn’t come across any rivers or anything. The flowers and the views were great! Easy hike, lots to look at. "
14,2019-06-16,['hiking'],It was beautiful! Great for a beginner. Shady at some points and sunny meadows at others! Very nice combination. Was a little rocky at places so be careful.
15,2019-06-15,['hiking'],"kids 8, and 6 did fine. A little tired at the end but a good one for families. Great views and especially nice with all the wild flowers. We didn't see any rattle snakes thankfully."
16,2019-06-14,"['hiking', 'no shade']","Beautiful hike, my 5 year old was insistent about doing the upper loop about half way through it got too hard and too steep for him and he ended heading back the way we came and finishing the lower loop. did hear some rattle snakes at a few points which was a bit unnerving, but never saw them. "
17,2019-06-11,['hiking'],"There was a ton of flora and fauna up here, the smell was amazing from all the flowers. Definitely dog and kid friendly. There was some small up hill and down hill spots but nothing too steep. The only thing to worry about is that about 1 mile in there was a group of kids yelling that they found a rattle snake, I didn’t see it but of course, your in nature so always be cautious. But other than that, it was definitely worth coming up here."
18,2019-06-10,"['bugs', 'scramble']","This trail was a good mix of gradual incline with some scrambles and loose rocks here and there. Amazing views, good mix of shade. "
19,2019-06-09,"['hiking', 'rocky']",great views and dog friendly. trail a bit rocky in parts but in good condition. wild flowers still in bloom but their time looks limited. 
20,2019-06-05,['hiking'],Awesome trail. A few mosquitoes at the beginning. Some nice stretches of shade provided by the scrub oak. Great views and several benches along the way. An easy family friendly and mature person (myself) trail. Lots of nice wildflowers along the way. 
21,2019-06-03,['hiking'],Took the kids on a hike (4 -9) and they loved it. Perfect hike for young hikers or those just looking for a nice relaxing walk
22,2019-06-02,"['mountain biking', 'muddy', 'off trail', 'rocky']","Beautiful day on a beautiful trail! A little muddy after all the rains and slippery for mountain biking, but fun nevertheless. Great views of the Great Salt Lake and Antelope island and the snow covered peaks! We veered south, away from the main Wild Rose trail which had much fewer people."
23,2019-06-02,[''],Love this trail. Super chill. 
24,2019-05-28,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
25,2019-05-27,['hiking'],Great easy trail for dog lovers. Easy loop for a which get away from The city. 
26,2019-05-12,['hiking'],Great EASY trail. Kids 7-17 plus dog and all enjoyed it! Just enough shade and beautiful wild flowers.
27,2019-05-10,['hiking'],Awesome trail! Kid friendly and beautiful views 
28,2019-05-05,['rocky'],"nice trail, easy for kids and dogs. not too many people."
29,2019-05-04,['hiking'],"This was a beautiful little hike, I took a shorter loop due to time constraints, there weren’t many bugs around! I did pass a few people but not as many as expected for a Saturday afternoon. There are several shade spots, as well."
30,2019-05-02,['trail running'],For a flat lander on a business trip this was ideal to run. Great view of mountains and flats.
31,2019-04-24,['hiking'],"Really easy and quick hike. Not strenuous at all. It’s quite a nice stroll. Sunset Point is incredible and THE VIEWS... that will take your breath away far more than the hike will! 10/10, will do again. Also this is a perfect after work hike, especially on a perfect sunny evening like tonight was."
32,2019-04-22,['hiking'],"Very pretty, great for my dogs. Went around 6PM on a Friday and only saw a handful of people."
33,2019-04-14,['hiking'],"Easy, dog-friendly hike with nice views. Trails were a bit muddy due to the rain, but should dry up quickly."
34,2019-04-03,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
35,2019-01-28,['snowshoeing'],"Fun, easy trail. Mostly flat with a couple hills. Packed snow covered most of the trail with only a few South-facing spots with exposed rocks & mud. Multiple options to add miles. 
Trail could easily be done with cleats; snowshoes weren’t a necessity."
36,2019-01-10,[''],"Lots of options and outlets, did in late fall and it was great. Will do again in spring also great for trail running"
37,2018-12-08,['hiking'],Nice area. Lots of other trails. I Would like or come back in the spring
38,2018-11-10,['hiking'],"Good, short hike with nice views of the lake and surrounding communities. I appreciated the signage along the trail to help me decide if I wanted to extend the loop by checking out one of the spur trails."
39,2018-10-14,['hiking'],"This is an easy and fun family trail. We hiked from the park at the top of Sky Lark Lane to the lookout point and back. This part of the trail was shaded almost the whole way, and the fall colors were beautiful. my kids also enjoyed playing at the park when we were done."
40,2018-10-13,['hiking'],Nice easy trail in north Salt Lake City with dog off-leash. Met by a stray golden retriever. Hot day. Beautiful views of the city and great Salt Lake. Had to contend with a few mountain bikers on trails that criss-crossed the hiking trail making it a bit hectic for the free running dogs.
41,2018-10-01,['hiking'],Nice trail that was great for my dog. Has some great overlooks for views. Some parts are very narrow so make sure you are aware with the bikers using the trail. Leaves are turning very pretty up here.
42,2018-08-12,[''],Great for kids and the whole fam.
43,2018-07-12,[''],great for beginner/intermediate mtb. quick short and easy trails for after work
44,2018-07-07,['hiking'],"The views are great, but it was hot out there! The terrain was a little rocky, which was murder on my ankles. Otherwise, it was a nice little hike. It may not be the best for small dogs, as mine got worn out."
45,2018-07-05,[''],Great hike for a beginner like me. The view of the valley at the top was beautiful! I started around 6:30pm and it was still pretty hot - there is little shade on the trail...
46,2018-06-11,['hiking'],Great trail for hiking with a young family :)
47,2018-06-10,['hiking'],"This is a beautiful easy trail with stunning views of the valley. In May everything is lush, green and full of wildflowers."
48,2018-06-08,['hiking'],"Nice, easy trail with very few rocks or trip hazards. This trail overlaps with other trails so pay attention at all of the forks."
49,2018-06-04,[''],The trail was easy but breath taking. Loved the view and all the wild flowers!
50,2018-05-29,['hiking'],Easy hike. The trail is covered half of the hike and open for the rest so it may not be the best hike on a super hot day. Benches are positioned throughout the hike to sit if you need a rest. Wildflowers are out in force right now making it really pretty.
51,2018-05-17,['hiking'],Nice for an urban hike. Super kid friendly. My kids loved it!
52,2018-05-17,['mountain biking'],Overall really nice trail for mountain biking (especially for beginners) and it also seems it would be a nice trail for hiking too. Very beautiful scenery and would make for a wonderful sunset hike.
53,2018-05-15,['hiking'],"Very easy trail (especially if you have a little one on your back)! This trail is well marked—it surprised me how at each point there was a sign with a ‘you are here’ and map of the trail. Also continued to the Chukara loop as well, and that was a great extra mile if you’re up for it. Another nice surprise is the intermittent shaded areas, and the park benches allowing one to sit and take in the view! I’ll definitely do this again at some point!"
54,2018-05-14,[''],Perfect trail for beginners.
55,2018-05-14,[''],Hiked up on Saturday and it was raining but it was very beautiful! The colors and smell of spring is definitely a good hike to start off the season
56,2018-05-06,[''],The views are beautiful. There are wooded areas and open views of the whole valley. A little bit of everything with resting areas in the shade throughout. Easy trail for small or big dogs.
57,2018-05-02,['hiking'],"This trail is by far one of my favorites! I took my dogs out with me, it's a dog friendly off leash trail, and they enjoyed every bit of it! It's very easy and a beautiful hike! There are pretty flowers lining the trail most of the way and its lovely and lush right now!"
58,2018-04-21,['hiking'],"This is not the sort of hike where you’ll see stunning mountain vistas, but for what it is - more of an urban hike- it’s lovely. It’s full exposure, so spring or fall is the perfect time for it. The view from sunset point is pretty incredible as you can see most of the Salt Lake valley, the Great Salt Lake, and into Davis and Weber Counties. This could not be more fitting for small children as the incline is gradual and only 2 miles to do the shortcut route. The trail is well marked and well-maintained. Would do this again for a short hike with great city views."
59,2018-04-13,['hiking'],Such a stunning overlook towards Salt Lake and beautiful flowers along the path.
60,2018-03-30,['hiking'],"Great easy little trail. Well maintained & lots of signage. I wasn't expecting so much of the view to be of houses and a golf course, but the trailhead is at the top of a large subdivision."
61,2018-03-14,['hiking'],"Wow!  The views on this trail are 5 Star views.  The slippery snow on the trail and the few spots of mud made this hike SUPER hard for my 9 and 11 year old with special needs.  And the effort I had to put in to ensure they didn’t fall made this one of the longest 1.7 miles of my life.  My 15 year old flew over the same footing.  But even with the slipping and sliding, we loved this hike.  So beautiful!  I can only imagine how pretty it would be at other times of the year."
62,2018-02-18,[''],"I enjoyed the hike, easy but challenge enough for someone that is starting to hike. Beautiful view of the Valley and the mountains in the North East.. It was a little muddy but nothing really bad."
63,2018-02-17,['hiking'],Really enjoyed the hike. Little mud but not too bad. Views were awesome.
64,2018-01-03,['hiking'],"Trail alternated between ice and mud (mostly ice) but that’s not the fault of the trail. I fell on my butt once and slipped a lot (poor choice of boots for winter conditions, my bad). Trail was easy enough and had a nice mix of scrub forest and salt lake valley views. There are a few lookout points with metal benches along the trail as well. I went on a Wednesday afternoon at about 2-3pm and there was nobody else, which was great for my first solo off leash dog hike. The trailhead has a parking lot, a small park with a pavilion a playground, and bathrooms. I’ll be back!"
65,2018-01-02,['hiking'],Nice and easy climb with some good views. Would recommend!
66,2017-11-19,['hiking'],Great easy hike with amazing views.  Lots of parking and dogs ok off leash.  You can do the 2 mile Wild Rose loop or extend to 3 miles via the Chukara loop.  Trails are well maintained and very well marked.
67,2017-10-16,[''],"Great easy trail, great for kids (13, 9, 6). Easy to follow signs, cool playground and restrooms at the trailhead. Great fall colors and only a tiny bit of snow off to the sides. Some reviews made it sound like we would be hiking right next to big houses but it wasn't like that at all. Just some off in the distance. Didn't ruin it for me. Beautiful views."
68,2017-10-14,[''],Great little trail with some beautiful views of the fall colors.
69,2017-09-26,[''],The view at the top is amazing and definitely worth the short hike to get there.
70,2017-09-03,[''],closed due to fire danger
71,2017-08-12,['hiking'],Beautiful view and a very easy trail.
72,2017-08-08,['hiking'],"Great trail. It's not hard but has varying views; you will go through parts that are shaded with trees and shrubs then into open more dry areas. 

We took our dog and had no problems. This trail also connects with city Creek over look and another trail to the south so if you want to have a longer hike you just hike those."
73,2017-08-01,['hiking'],"Super easy, my dog and I like to run this trail on the evenings during the sunset."
74,2017-07-20,['hiking'],
75,2017-07-09,['hiking'],It was a nice very easy hike. Even though they had lots of maps I still found it a bit confusing. Great view of the city but I think I prefer greener hikes. It was a fun way to hang out with a friend.
76,2017-07-08,['hiking'],"Multiple loops can be taken. Do it all in one day or have a new adventure each time you go. Great for kids and dogs. I saw a few folks on bikes, also. Trailhead days it can take horses, but track is very skinny in places and maneuverability could be an issue. 5 stars."
77,2017-07-07,['hiking'],Great sunset views.
78,2017-07-04,['hiking'],This is a great place to do short little hikes. Park at the beginning of the trailhead. Only thing is that there is a lot of areas that are open to the blazing sun. Great for the little ones. Just go early in the morning so you don't get to hot
79,2017-07-01,['hiking'],Definitely needed this app to make sure I was on the right path and not on another like the biking path.
80,2017-06-24,['hiking'],We love this trail. So much nature to appreciate and multiple trails to take.
81,2017-06-21,['hiking'],"Very easy and fun trail. Very quiet and didn't see anyone else there. Very peaceful hike, and great for beginners."
82,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"This was a nice trail, but completely spoiled by the mansions and highway noise. Someone was mowing their lawn for about 20 minutes and I could hear it from the lookout point.

There were lots of birds and some pretty flowers. I only passed about 5 people and I liked how the biking trails were separate. Bring your sunscreen because the trail is mostly unshaded.

This was a nice little hike, but I really prefer to be completely away from the city noise, so I probably won't do it again."
83,2017-06-12,[''],Smells like flowers and you get a great view
84,2017-06-08,['mountain biking'],Very nice local NSL trail for hiking and sections for mountain biking.  Was cool and breezy today despite the valley heat.
85,2017-06-03,['hiking'],
86,2017-05-30,['mountain biking'],Roughly 30 minutes or less mountain bike. Great scenery and downhill run is fantastic.
87,2017-05-27,['hiking'],Great easy hike. Had 5 kids with me and it was perfect for them...even the 2 year-old walked most of it. Fun lookout points. Quite a few bikers...but all were great.
88,2017-05-13,[''],"Great views, good parking available, saw a dog, 11/10 would hike again"
89,2017-05-01,['hiking'],EAsy loops. Definitely kid friendly. I like how some of the trails are separated from the biking trails so the bikes can whizz down. Can't beat the park at the trailhead
90,2017-05-01,[''],Love it...
91,2017-03-11,[''],Still a little muddy. Easy to do. Beautiful scenery
92,2017-02-11,['hiking'],"1st trail of season,  muddy"
93,2017-02-05,['mountain biking'],"Some pretty good mountain biking, just make sure to stay on the trails marked for biking and try not to hit any hikers!"
94,2016-10-16,[''],Nice trail running. Dog friendly and kids can handle it. Open some shade. you can see Salt Lake from the top.
95,2016-09-11,['hiking'],"These are more rolling hills than they are mountains with lots of scrub oak so the trails are pretty easy. The views along the way are stunning, giving you many lookouts of the great salt lake, and antelope island. I would recommend doing this at sunset to see the amazing sunset going down over the lake and island."
96,2016-09-06,['hiking'],"Really nice trail, dirt but smooth enough and not too steep for a jogging stroller.  Great maps and markers.  Not too busy in the morning and a really nice park with covered picnic tables at the trailhead.  Will definitely come back with my mountain bike since there are dedicated downhill trails."
97,2016-09-05,[''],"fairly easy, good exercise, nice views."
98,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"A great, easy trial with my teenage boys. Amazing views!  I liked that we were in and out of the shade of the oak trees. 
Can't wait to go back again and take a different route. My boys want to go back with their bikes."
99,2016-08-13,[''],little guy only lasted 30 minutes. wanted to go back and play in park where the trail started. i want to come back and do this at night to see the city lights.
100,2016-08-07,['hiking'],This is a great trail for a Sunday evening with family and friends. Today beautiful sunset.
101,2016-07-29,[''],"Easy walk, great views of Salt Lake and Bountiful, Utah. Highly recommend !"
102,2016-07-18,[''],Loved this trail
103,2016-07-17,['hiking'],good maintained trail where you can view rich people.. kidding.  kind of
104,2016-07-11,['hiking'],"Hidden gem, we were very surprised by how much we enjoyed the trail. Short, easy hike with some beautiful wild flowers and a great view."
105,2016-07-09,['hiking'],Love how shaded this hike was. Very easy and kid friendly. Got a little confused since there is a Wild Rose Loop trail and a Wild Rose Trail. We did the loop . Awesome views minus the golf course and mansions.
106,2016-07-08,['hiking'],We loved the butterflies and shade.  Nice view and not too many people on the trail.
107,2016-07-06,['hiking'],Great trail. Easy for kids of all ages. Great for pets also. Shaded a lot of the time which made it very nice. Rolling hills were fun for the kids.  Great Lookout point about halfway through the trail.
108,2016-06-27,['hiking'],Very simple hike. Nice and easy. I went at sunset and was able to watch the sun go down and that was amazing plus it wasn't to hot
109,2016-06-18,['hiking'],"This was a nice hike.  It wasn't too difficult and it was well marked.  It was perfect for a quick hike with my date.  We hiked it in the evening -- started around 6 PM -- and it was pleasant.  We hiked the loop counter clockwise and took the ""shortcut"" on the maps at the trail, so the most strenuous part of the trail was first.  We loved the views and the bench at the top of the trail was nice to just sit and look at the views of the valley."
110,2016-06-08,['hiking'],"This is easy hike and toddler friendly, the trail is all shaded, we hiked In the morning and it's not that busy.follow the map and stop for breaks, very pretty views"
111,2016-06-06,[''],Awesome with kids.  My 7 and 4 yr olds did great.
112,2016-06-05,[''],great trail for kids. took my 3 year old and he did great.
113,2016-05-31,['hiking'],Good easy trail! Light traffic and very pretty! Enjoyed this hike
114,2016-05-27,['hiking'],"A bit unimpressed until I reach the wild rose/city creak trail and then it was AMAZING. It gets steep at that point but don't turn around, don't feel lost, keep on the trail because it loops around and it's gorgeous."
115,2016-05-19,['hiking'],Great views of Davis County and the Great Salt Lake. Easy trail for kids.
116,2016-05-07,['hiking'],great views
117,2016-05-02,['hiking'],"Went my my five year old and he loved it. It was an easy hike with great views, wild flowers and lots of butterflies."
118,2016-04-21,[''],Great after work hike. Beautiful views nice trail.
119,2016-04-09,[''],This is a pretty lame trail mostly because you can see giant McMansions the whole time. No natural solitude like a hike should be. Otherwise its a simple walking trail.
120,2016-04-08,['hiking'],The Trail was a little confusing because there are so many trails. Probably wouldn't do it again
121,2015-11-28,['hiking'],"Very convenient access to the trailhead. With a short walk, you access nice views of the valley. Relatively easy trail--even with kids. I recommend it when you're looking to squeeze in a hike on a busy weekend. We will certainly return again; trailhead is only 5 mins from my house."
122,2015-10-28,['hiking'],"Directions: The trails directions will take you right to the trailhead. There is a bathroom and a playground as well as parking. The bathroom says it will be closed from October-April. 

The hike itself wasn't anything spectacular. There are a bunch of signs spaced out all the way up the trail to help so you don't get lost, as there are a lot of forks and biking trails. The leaves were changing colors, and it was a little cooler, so being in the sun most of the time was perfect. 

The view when we got to the top was amazing!! It would be a perfect spot to watch the sunset. My kids did pretty well, but we've also been hiking a lot since Summer. They loved playing on the playground once we got done. There were a lot of gnats at the playground, but I didn't notice them at all on the hike."
123,2015-07-21,[''],This is a great family trail and also a great trail run. Make sure you keep going at the top to see a spectacular view of north salt lake on one side and bountiful on the other. Also great for mountain biking. (The mountain bike trail is separate so no worries about running into hikers and visa versa). Dogs are welcome!
124,2015-06-18,['hiking'],This was a great late evening hike.  A lot of the trail is out in the sun so don't go during peak times unless you like it hot.  We took one of the longer options to the view point.  A lot of great scenery.
125,2015-02-05,['trail running'],"great loop for running and a quick outdoors time at the end of the day. Running, snowshoeing and hiking are fun for a quick one."
126,2014-07-17,['hiking'],"I did the moderate, 2 1/2 mile trail that overlooks City Creek and Salt Lake. The trail split off a lot, and it was sometimes difficult to see which way to go. The view was great once we got there-- but this trail has very little shade, and it was pretty hot with a steep, uphill grade and lots of locusts and dryness. I probably wouldn't do this trail again."
127,2014-05-17,[''],This trail is family friendly.  It has a bathroom and park at trail head. We did the wild rose loop and it was a nice trail with signs. There is not much shade though.
128,2014-05-05,[''],"Lovely hike up to Sunset Point and then back around.  The exposed areas would be pretty hot in the summer, but there were also plenty of areas where the scrub oak arbored over the trail.  Saw a doe and her fawn, heard chukars and black capped chickadees. The park at the end was a nice place to have lunch.  There were a few other hikers, and a couple of mountain bikers on the trail."
129,2013-11-02,['hiking'],"Nice family trail. Would have been great to get up here a few weeks earlier while the trees still had all of their leaves.

Definitely will be back to take advantage of the biking trails!!"
130,2013-10-14,['hiking'],"Very fun little hike. We took my daughters friend on her ""first hike"" and it was perfect for her ! Pretty views and super easy doing it again this week with the older kids to go explore some of the other trails. Perfect for the kidos !!!!!!"
131,2013-09-16,['hiking'],"Fun little trail! Easy and great for the dog.

"
132,2013-04-09,['snowshoeing'],This was a perfect loop trip for snowshoeing.  I took this trail during the Sunday Morning Hiking Series #43 - Wild Rose Loop Geocaching event.  The snow was fresh and fluffy that day.  We started off going to the North to the top of the hill with a nice bench and a great view of the valley the loop then round out and back south down into the valley and back up towards ensign peak.  There are several trail options once on top. We chose to take the Meridian Peak option.  Nice trails that are very well maintained and used.  Be careful to pay attention to the signs in this area some trails are specifically for bike traffic only on the down hill.
