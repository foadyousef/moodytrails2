0,2019-08-27,['hiking'],Quite a challenging ascent but it was the descent that really got me. Good traction is a must. Poles optional but would help with the steep slope. Beautiful views throughout the hike. 
1,2019-08-25,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'rocky', 'scramble']",Good incline trail.  The turn off from Indian is not marked but has a stair step of boulders that is visible as a trail.  Last part at the top is meadow with flowers and quite pretty though with some bugs. I recommend poles as some of the inclines as sand and loose rock.
2,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"Terrific trail and many changes in scenery.  Meadows, desert, and otter amazing terrains..."
3,2019-08-08,['hiking'],"Excellent trail,  very pretty.  But man... those inclines,  though! "
4,2019-08-03,['hiking'],"Excellent hike, challenging with the steep ascent but well worth the view and rock tower at the top. Highly recommend. "
5,2019-08-01,['hiking'],This little trail kicked my trash! I did it at the hottest time of the day which was a mistake and after I hiked the Indian trail. Pretty steep at some points. Beautiful view once you get to the end
6,2019-07-16,['hiking'],"Steep, rocky, dusty trail, so definitely challenging. But the scenery is gorgeous once you get into the hidden valley. The meadows and the trees help to cool the air during the summer. Lovely views as well. Definitely recommend."
7,2019-07-13,['hiking'],This trail was definitely one of the steeper ones I have done. I completed it in about 3.5 hours and to be honest I felt the view at the end didn’t live up to the work it took to get there. I did hear the route from Taylor’s Canyon is much more pleasant. When I got to the top of this trail I couldn’t even stay long because of all the bugs. It was hot and mostly unshaded and I wish I would’ve had poles. I feel like you can get similar views from other trails in the area without killing your legs on the incline and with much more shade. 
8,2019-07-11,['hiking'],Great view. Beautiful morning hike. Reached the top at noon. You will miss the turn if you are not watching... sign is on the little rock. Beautiful meadows.
9,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"very steep climb up. it was worth it in the end. the wildflowers are beautiful. we definitely had to take it slow at parts going back down because of the steepness and the loose gravel, but we made it just fine in our trail running shoes. multiple hikers we met on the way back down told us we should have kept going at the top and taken Taylor's canyon down as it'll loop back around to the cars as well. "
10,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"This hike definitely falls into the hard category with long stretches of vertical climb.  Hiking shoes/boots are a must as trail is rocky and loose in spots.  Trail is narrow and sunny for the most part.  I enjoyed the challenge and length of this hike.  We clocked 6 miles total from 22nd St trailhead.  (Good parking at the trailhead on paved road).  Glad it wasn’t another mile longer!  There were lots of scenery changes - valley views, rocky outcrops, forest and lush valleys, wildflowers, and dense brush.  Things level out once you reach the narrow valley at the top.  You know you’ve reached the end of the hike when you get to the large cairn with a gorgeous open view of the mountain across hidden valley.  It’s worth sticking it out to the end of trail!  Just pace yourself and take breaks after the steeper climbs and save some water for the way back.  It’s slower going than you’d think on the way down due to the steepness of trail.  "
11,2019-06-22,['hiking'],"Not moderate by any scale I'm familiar with and I've hiked just about every trail from Ogden Canyon to Mueller park in Bountiful. It is a grind with no shade until you do 1000 ft+ of elevation gain--start early and take lots of water. Well-maintained trail though often fallen trees/muddy on the last mile. The views at the ""end"" are spectacular. "
12,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"Pretty difficult, we did it while carrying 2 kids. The top is beautiful with pine trees and a great view. You need to go when the flowers are in bloom. "
13,2019-05-17,['hiking'],Love this hike. I think more difficult than moderate. It’s a steep uphill. Went up Hidden Valley and came down Taylor Canyon. Had to cross the stream 3 times on the way down. Not easy with rushing water but it made it exciting. I would not take a kid on the Taylor Canyon part of this hike until stream can easily be crossed. We were so thankful we did not have our 6 yr old with us!
14,2019-05-06,['hiking'],"Pretty nice hike, but I would say it's closer to difficult than moderate. We hiked to the top, then continued past the rock pile that marks the end, down into Taylor Canyon. We then took the Taylor Canyon trail back to the 22nd Street trailhead. Parts of the loop were quite rough and un-maintained, and I would recommend wearing long pants. Not much shade is available, especially in the afternoon, so I would recommend going before 8 am. It took us about 4 hours to complete the loop at an easy-going pace. The turnoff from Indian Trail is very easy to miss and unmarked, so keep an eye out for what looks like a pile of rocks you can climb up and perhaps keep your phone's GPS on."
15,2019-05-04,"['hiking', 'snow']","Not a lot of shade for the first 1.75 miles, and a bit of snow the last .5."
16,2019-04-29,[''],"This was a steep trail. I have hiked some rated as difficult that were comparable to this one, maybe even easier. We enjoyed the beautiful views of the valley and the trail was reasonably easy to follow. Although we hit one spot where it was not clear if we had taken a wrong turn but appeared to be off the trail so we turned around."
17,2018-12-29,['snowshoeing'],Cut the last portion of the trail in. Snow is about 2 feet deep in the last section
18,2018-12-24,['hiking'],"The trail was well defined, serene, and quiet. I recommend, some water, a snack,  spikes, and snowshoes. Worth the views!!"
19,2018-11-16,[''],"A real hidden gem, did this last week, got a little snow. I could see where the vegetation could block the views, but in the fall it was beautiful."
20,2018-10-14,['hiking'],"It was a really challenging trail for me. It’s a good trail to overlook the city, but not much of an escape. I would recommend it for fireworks watching. The traffic, planes, trains, and emergency vehicles are audible all the way up the trail. The work you put in doesn’t feel like an equal output."
21,2018-10-09,[''],Enjoyed the challenging hike during the cooler temperatures. Very peaceful at the end to relax.
22,2018-09-15,[''],Did approximately 3 1/2  miles round trip. Nice climb
23,2018-08-16,['hiking'],I did this hike by myself and for starters I would say it was harder than moderate... I’m a distance runner so I would say I am in pretty good shape and this hike kicked my ass! Very very steep and there’s hardly any shade so it was sooo hot. I didn’t have a lot of water left and I was dehydrated and I was alone so I didn’t make it to the top because I was nervous about fainting so I turned around after 2 miles. Pretty hike and very challenging. Would like to do it in colder weather for sure. If you’re looking for a challenge this is a great hike to do. When you turn off the indian trail pay attention bc I missed it but thanks to this app I found it quickly.
24,2018-08-01,[''],"My husband and I and our friend Erin completed this hike on July 28.

We started the hike at about 12:30, and made it down around 3:30 (although we did jog part of the way down).  It was a 100* day, and only 10% of the trail is shaded, so we were roasting. The trail is moderately inclined the entire way, with sections that are severely steep. We stopped probably 10 times on the way up.  

The views at the top were great.... we're glad we made it! My only complaint for this hike is the directions. I've been on the Indian Trail multiple times and never noticed the turnoff for Hidden Valley.

Would definitely recommend this hike for anyone who is in good shape and ready to take on a serious climb."
25,2018-07-15,['hiking'],Love this hike! It’s probably in my top top 3 in Ogden ❤️ it’s definitely a steep climb but the climb is worth the view!
26,2018-07-06,[''],"Love this hike, but we ran into a rattlesnake this morning (July 6) so we ended up turning around. It’s also possible it was a gopher snake. It was only 7:00am so we totally thought we were going early enough. Just be careful on the warm summer mornings."
27,2018-06-25,[''],"I would say this hike is a bit more on the harder side of moderate. 
There wasn’t much shade, so definitely wear sunscreen! We saw LOTS of lizards, butterflies, dragonflies and a couple of hawks."
28,2018-06-20,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail this morning, June 20, 2018, from 22nd Street via the lower Indian Trail connector, to the cairns overlooking Taylor Canyon. There are two cairns, one a little larger than the other, to each of which I added my rock. Fun hike, slightly strenuous, some loose and steep spots, but enjoyable. Passed through a couple of small meadows filled with wildflowers and dragonflies. Duration: 2:22:06, distance: 5.03 miles, elevation gain: 2,111 ft."
29,2018-06-14,[''],"Amazing trail,  very steep, but that's what we are looking for."
30,2018-05-28,['camping'],the top of this hike is so peaceful and quiet it is a perfect escape from everything. you could hangout at the top and just look at the valley forever.
31,2018-05-05,['hiking'],"One of my favorite hikes. If you’re looking for a good workout with a good view at the end of it then go this trail. Went up today and encountered a rattlesnake so keep an eye out. Passed by a couple hikers and a biker but the trail wasn’t traveled much. No snow or muddy spots and the backside of the trail where you connect with Taylor trail was clear as well. 
Definitely worth the time."
32,2018-04-29,['hiking'],This trail should be considered hard instead of moderate. Beautiful hike. Nice leg and butt workout since it is climbing uphill incline the entire hike up.
33,2018-04-17,[''],"once you turn off the Indian trail and head South (not marked)  you pretty much are going up, up and up. The valley is peaceful and you won't pass any other hikers. Lots of animal tracks in the mud and snow once you are in the canyon. Totally worth doing, but be prepared to climb."
34,2017-12-03,[''],This is a great trail to get your heart rate up. Close to town but once in the valley you can’t see civilization. One of my favorites!
35,2017-10-19,['hiking'],Beautiful views of Ogden. Get some good accent for the 2 Miles or so. There are still leaves on some of the trees!!
36,2017-09-06,['hiking'],went on labor day and there were hardly any people on the trail despite a full parking lot at 22nd street. steep but enjoyable hike! the end was gorgeous! Next time we'll try to get there for the sunrise.
37,2017-08-20,['hiking'],"I know some people really like to hike for the outcome and views, but I enjoy a beautiful hike all around and this was not! If you like views you will love it once you get to the top. It's a pretty rough hike, incline all the way up, but I'm not in great shape either. The trail upkeep was nice so that wasn't a huge issue. I saw some fall pictures so maybe I'll try again then because they look beautiful. Today it was just ugly, dry, and full of grasshoppers. I was a little disappointed because of everyone else's great reviews. Great workout though!!"
38,2017-08-18,[''],"Quite steep at places, but the views are worth it! Your calves will thank you later."
39,2017-08-06,['hiking'],"I would rate this trail as ""hard"" more than ""moderate"". But maybe that is because I start at Rainbow Gardens instead of 22nd st. This adds a mile each way, and some elevation gain.

One of my favorites in the area. Fantastic workout for your calves, quads, and glutes. Very steep. Probably too difficult for smaller children.

If you don't think that you are fit enough to make it all the way to the rock pile, just try to make it about 1.5 miles in to the valley overlook. Best view of ogden there is, other than Ben Lomond or Lewis Peak."
40,2017-07-01,['hiking'],"This is a fairly steep trail for nearly the entire go-- great for power-hiking to get your butt, quads and calves burning.  I'm pretty darn fit, and I found it challenging but still fun.  It's not nearly as crowded as the lower trails and has some great views of the valley before heading into some nice secluded wooded areas that feel lightyears away from the city. 
Yes, it's true, you can now connect to Taylor.  BUT-- I would caution those who are thinking of attempting this that the trail is new and not all that solid yet, and it gets a little scrappy in places.  You have to cross a couple big rock slides, go down some steep inclines that are pretty gravel-y, and pick your way through some patches of scrub oak.  Totally doable, but a bit trickier than most of the trails I've encountered up here."
41,2017-06-18,[''],"Great hike. It’s short, but quite a workout. It’s fairly steep until about the last 1/2 mile or so, where it levels off a bit and you get some relief. This trail now connects to Taylor Canyon below, so you can do a loop, instead of going back the same way."
42,2017-06-14,[''],This trail is a knee burner. It connects to Taylor's Canyon now so it keeps on going more than 5 miles.
43,2017-06-11,[''],This trail is HARD. Make sure to keep an eye out to make sure you don't just keep going on Indian Trail. There are lots of steep parts. It's nice because there aren't many people who use it so you're likely to not see anyone.
44,2017-05-14,[''],Nice trail with usually little traffic.
45,2017-01-15,['hiking'],"I live on the Bonneville Shoreline but for some reason I have never hiked Hidden Valley. Well, today was the day EXCEPT that we couldn't go all the way b/c there was a spot that was just too slippery and difficult to cross in the snow, so we turned around about 1 mile up. Still a great hike with incredible views and I will definitely be back."
46,2016-11-14,['hiking'],"The first 2/3rds of the trail is definitely more on the difficult side with some steep sections, very nice once you get up into the valley itself with great views at the overlook!"
47,2016-09-16,['hiking'],Probably my favorite hike in Ogden. It's definitely a harder one and the way down is hard on the knees. But I love it anyway!
48,2016-09-06,[''],"This is a Hard Hike , the Trail Head to Hidden Valley starts about 3/4 of the way up the Indian trail on the Ogden side of the mountain , the trail head is a scattering of stones forming a natural stair way up for about 15 feet . Then the main trail begins , at first it's a gradual climb but turns into a  very steep trail . A great work out for those Calf & Thigh muscles .  The trail goes up & up & up 
But worth every step .
Soon you come to an overlook into Ogden valley , great place to have a snack and rest those puppy toes . The trail soon levels out with about 4 camping areas including rock fire circles and flat areas for your tent . Or if your a hammock person plenty of sturdy trees to set it up on . 
The trail finally comes out on a point looking into Taylor's Canyon . With a rock Kaaren that's about 5 feet tall . Make sure to place your rock in place ..  
Hidden valley is really an over look into the top of Taylor's Canyon .
From the name it sounds like a hidden valley up on the mountain , that's just not the case ..
Now turn around and head back .
Unless you'd like some more adventure , if this is the case then continue down the mere Deer trail below the Kaaren there are two stacks of rock marking the trail down into Taylor's 
This trail is Extreme very very steep , hard to find trail , bush wracking down ..scramble in lots of places on the trail . Do not be fooled by the perfect trail that you come to , it ends in about 100 yards . The trail continues to go up and down along the side of the mountain until finally dropping into the valley below .. The trail forks ., right fork takes you out left fork takes you to a very cool fort or camp complete with seating around a fire pit . The trail ends about a mile further up in oak brush ."
49,2016-08-29,['hiking'],its beautiful up a little forest not a lot of people go up there lol
50,2016-06-28,['hiking'],"Great hike challenging enough that's for sure but definitely worth it . It's beautiful ! Did see more people than I expected but that's probably because it was Sunday.
This fall I'll try and go on to hike out Taylor canyon and make it a loop."
51,2016-06-19,['hiking'],One of our families favorite hikes. Much of the trail is secluded with very light traffic. Nice to get away from the heavily used trails.
52,2015-10-12,['hiking'],"This hike is beautiful, especially right now in the fall all the leaves are changing. Only problem to be careful about, there is a black wasp hive in the ground. All 3 of us that hiked this got multiple stings. Look out for holes in that ground."
53,2015-06-07,['hiking'],"Great, challenging hike... But not too bad as our six year old did it. We actually went beyond the overlook and down a narrow trail that led to the Taylor Canyon Trail. This allowed us to make it a loop."
54,2015-06-02,[''],"Kinda disappointing.  The last part hiking through the a pristine alpine meadow was lovely.  But the ""bowl"" is not all it's cracked up to be"
55,2015-04-24,['hiking'],"Hidden Valley is just that, a hidden valley in the shadows of Mt Ogden. This is a great trail to hike but is a very steep hike. Bring extra water with you on this hike as you will need it from the effort it takes to get to the end requires a lot of water. A few camping spots are available once you enter the valley so a quick overnight backpacking trip is a perfect plan for this trail. Enjoy the views of Ogden and the close up of Mt Ogden this is a great hike for sure."
56,2015-04-18,['hiking'],"This is a fairly tough trail, but the payout at the end is worth it. Don't get discouraged by the switchbacks through out. They're only there to help you. Once you get up into the valley, be sure to walk all the way to the end of the trail for a nice view of Mt. Ogden, Malans Peak, and  Taylors Canyon. I want to come back and camp up there as the trail isn't busy at all and there's several neat camping spots in the valley."
57,2015-04-12,[''],"Very nice trail only saw two people on it.. The valley that's in the pics was smaller than I expected but I trudged on to one of the peaks near it for an over nighter! Am excited to hike down the same trail in the morning.

It's very steep in places and with my 60lb pack it was a struggle at times to make it and im in incredible shape! So if u get winded going up stairs this isn't the trail for u!"
58,2013-09-29,['hiking'],"Fall is the perfect time for this hike.  Overcast, cool, with vibrant colors all along the way.  No snow on the trail, but from the top one can see the sprinkling of snow on Mt. Ogden.  It's a lovely secluded hike, but yes, very steep.

To hike it all the way from Rainbow Gardens (which makes it a little over 3 miles and some 2400' elevation one way), make sure you take the L towards the Bonneville Shoreline Trail right at the beginning, then keep going up, once you are on the bench don't fall for the L out towards the lookout.  After you successfully access the Indian Trail and are climbing quickly with Ogden Canyon far below, watch carefully for the steep stone steps off to your R.  There is no sign.  The easiest way is to use an app for your phone like the alltrails app so you can see when you are approaching it.  From there just get ready to climb!"
59,2013-04-23,['hiking'],"I picked the perfect time to do this hike.  This is not a trail I would want to do in the heat of summer.  You are highly exposed for most of the hike until you reach the Valley area.  Once in the Valley the temperature drops and there is plenty of cover.  It is worth the hike once the trail turns East and into the trees.  This truly is a Hidden Valley, a little paradise.  I followed the trail out to the spectacular views of Mt. Ogden and Taylor's Canyon below.  If you are looking for something a little harder that is close to Ogden, this is the place.  If you not sure of the area ask some one where the turn off to Hidden Valley is or you will breeze right by it.   "
60,2013-04-21,['hiking'],"This is a fun hike that in about two miles makes you feel like the city is far away. I've hiked this in the winter and spring and both are equally enjoyable.  There is no water on the trail and it can be steep in places, but the views are great. "
61,2013-04-03,['hiking'],"Is this the same one that is off of Indian Trail?  Because according to the pathways pamphlet, Indian trail is 4.3 miles one way and Hidden Valley is 1.4 miles one way.  I will post a review after I've hiked it.

Yes, this is the one off Indian Trail.  If you start at 22nd st, it is only about 2 miles one way.  Figure about 1.4 miles for the trail and another .3 to .4 miles on Indian trail leading up to Hidden Valley.  The trail is steep but not too bad.  There is a slight spot of shale rock that can get slippery.  The view is amazing (it always is)."
62,2012-06-25,['hiking']," Recommend that you be in decent shape before hiking this one, it gets rather steep. "
