4,2019-08-19,['hiking'],Love this trail. Always fun to walk and meet other hikers and dogs. Bikers are pleasant and considerate. Great views and the Ice Box is a great trail with plenty of river stops. Thinking about biking from Snow  Basin down some day. 
5,2019-08-16,['hiking'],Love this trail! 
6,2019-08-07,['hiking'],"Nice, overcast day for a hike. We went the counter-clockwise way from the Art Nord trailhead down to Ice Box Canyon trail and back around to the trailhead. Came across a family of wild turkeys on the way back to the car."
7,2019-07-28,['hiking'],"Great hike! you get a workout for sure, I hiked from the parking area along the Art Nord trail, saving Icebox for last, which was ideal! It is somewhat rocky in areas, So I would recommend shoes with a thick sole..as other reviewers have written, shade is a premium on alot of this trail, Icebox gives you the most, with a constant sound of flowing water it makes the trail. Alot of nice views all around, worth the effort to complete!"
8,2019-07-25,"['hiking', 'rocky']","If on a hot day, you decide to head up the canyon to enjoy a hike in the middle of the afternoon this is not the hike for you! Very rocky road, not much shade until you get to Icebox Canyon. Icebox was the best part of the hike- close to the stream and shaded"
9,2019-07-20,['bird watching'],Hiked 4 miles total - from the parking area to the start of the loop and then a ways on the Icebox portion of the loop and back. Beautiful scenery but few birds. Will go back when I’m wearing hiking boots for the rocky trail.
10,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"Such a great hike!   So beautiful!   It includes everything you could love.   A river nearby, beautiful mountains, trees, shade, fresh air, with moderate exercise to make you feel like you're working, but not too hard.    Just a perfect hike!    "
11,2019-07-13,['hiking'],"Love this trail, I would say it’s more on the easy side. I enjoy having a nice picnic on the Art Nord side near the meadows. "
12,2019-07-12,['hiking'],"Hiked this trail in the evening and it was perfect! Walked from the trailhead to where it splits for the loop, then walked a little further into Icebox Canyon. This trail was nicely shaded at about 7pm and refreshingly cool.

Near the beginning of the trail when the trail crosses over the creek, be sure to take a peak under the bridge where there is an offshoot path to the right to see some cool graffiti.

One thing to watch out for is cyclists, since it is sometimes hard to hear them coming with the sound of the stream or there may be low visibility around a bend (Icebox Canyon part). 

I highly recommend this hike!"

14,2019-07-02,"['horseback riding', 'rocky']",had a wonderful ride with my wife and 2 horses. we started from art nord (better trailer parking) and went to Ogden canyon.  gradual climb with mostly dirt trail. there are a few areas that are pretty rocky. but even for our older horses (20yrs) they did just fine. there isnt a good place to water them until you get to the art nord parking area where there is a meadow and almost camping area. all around great view with shade most the way. watch out for bikers some dont follow the right of way for horses and can be going pretty fast downhill. oh there were also a lot of horse flies around our trailer and ate our horses alive after the ride. there are quite a few people out with there dogs also but should have leashes on!!!!
15,2019-06-30,['hiking'],"We started about 6:30 PM and this is such a great trail to hike in the evening, especially when it’s 91 degrees in town. The canyon is shaded and much cooler! We started at Wheeler Creek trailhead and hiked to the Art Nord trailhead (1.8 miles). We were worried about running out of daylight so we just went back the way we came instead of doing the loop. Not horrible traffic on the trail, but there are bikers and other hikers quite frequently. My kids loved seeing the lizards in the rocks. I think we’ll have to go back, start at the Art Nord trailhead, go down Icebox Canyon, then loop around on the Wheeler Creek trail next time."
16,2019-06-20,['hiking'],This is a go to favorite!! Beautiful scenery and close to a creek! Partially shaded but can get hot in the exposed areas when temperatures rise. A must do for anyone! 
17,2019-06-20,['hiking'],"This hike was a good one for my 3-year-old and 6-year-old. We did the first 1.1 miles of the trail (turn around right before the loop starts). The trail was not steep and it was very wide, so we could hike several people wide. There is a pretty steep drop off on one side of the trail. The views were beautiful and because it was in the canyon, it wasn't too hot. We liked to be able to see the water as we hiked."
18,2019-06-17,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Love this trail!  Great trail for dogs, lots of places to get into the river.  "
19,2019-05-18,[''],My family has been hiking here for years.  It is close and beautiful.  I prefer to go up Icebox and around.
20,2019-03-03,['hiking'],Beautiful hike in the snow. Brought snowshoes but didn’t need them. Could hear the creek most of the time. Awesome views of Snow Basin.
21,2019-02-17,"['hiking', 'snow']",Beautiful trail. Many snowshoe and hikers Packed down trail so just no problem with just crampons. Saw a moose on the Art Norde leg of the trail.
22,2019-01-04,['hiking'],Great easy hike.  Cold start but warmed up as we go out in the sunlight.
23,2018-11-15,['hiking'],We completed this hike on September 19th and it was an awesome experience. The hike up the canyon was a steady gradient with lots of rocks but it was easily manageable and the views were spectacular. I appreciated the amount of shade in the canyon and the cool air made it the perfect temperature. We initially overshot the Art Nord trail and had to double back to make the loop but it wasn't a huge deal. The Art Nord section of the trail was packed dirt with more excellent canyon views. Overall this was an awesome fall hike and I look forward to completing it again in the future.
24,2018-10-21,['hiking'],Nice trail...well maintained and easy to follow and has open and shaded areas.  Very steady climb and only a few steep areas.  I will definitely to this again.
25,2018-09-01,['hiking'],Easy hike.
26,2018-08-17,['hiking'],"This trail offers amazing views!! Some of it it shaded, like next to the creek in Ice Box Canyon. Lots of trees and meadows. Beautiful mountain cliff views! The perfect amount of incline for the length of the trail. This one will be a go to trail time after time!!"
27,2018-05-05,['hiking'],"Took my 9 year old on this hike. We took our time, but would consider this closer to an easy hike."
