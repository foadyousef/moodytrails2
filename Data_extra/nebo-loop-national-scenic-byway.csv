0,2019-07-01,['hiking'],So we drove up to the devils kitchen look out. I looked on google Maps to find a way to hike into the actual kitchen and it shows one... however when you actually drive up there it becomes obvious that there is no route to get in there. If someone knows away let me know. Also... saw my first rattle snake on the path to the look out so be careful.

From there is was a 60 min walk towards the Maple Lake through the snow (so good shoes needed). The way down was a lot quicker. A beautiful walk, with great views and a beautiful snowy Maple Lake. Doable with kids."

There are some nice overlooks and many hiking trails. There are several more trails on this drive that aren't listed here in alltrails. There are many places to camp for free as well as a few private campgrounds (pay for camping) along this route."

The drive is breathtaking. There enough places where you can stop and enjoy the scenery.  
The walk to Grotto Falls is short and nice.
Red Lake is not special but the colors made it worth the drive there.
Devil's Kitchen is worth a very short walk but if you have seen Bryce then it's also nothing special."

6,2017-07-06,[''],"The hike itself isn't bad, the trail has beautiful scenery and when we were there we only saw three people the whole time. But the drive was gorgeous!!"
7,2016-10-02,['scenic driving'],"Iâ€™ve taken this drive many times, living nearby, I took it again today and stopped to take some pictures.
Also Hiked around Big East Lake and found a few geocaches.
It's a nice drive."
8,2016-08-28,[''],Beautiful drive. I prefer it over the alpine loop
9,2016-07-10,[''],I've loved this loop since I was young.
10,2016-07-01,[''],Very scenic drive! Personally I think it's better than the Alpine loop
11,2015-08-14,['scenic driving'],Beautiful!  We like to take family when they are visiting to hike and see the beautiful vistas.
12,2015-06-03,['scenic driving'],Long and beautiful! I had the road to myself and got to take some awesome pictures along the way.
13,2015-05-10,['scenic driving'],"Very scenic, desert, mountains, historic sites."
14,2015-04-18,[''],Beautiful ride.  Took the loop trip when we came out to climb the highest Peak in the county.  A long wonderful day.
15,2014-10-26,['scenic driving'],"Beautiful area. Roads are very well maintained, plenty of pull offs, and impressive views. Take a moment to stop and make the short walk out to Devil's Kitchen. This is a must do in the fall!"
16,2013-11-10,['scenic driving'],Beautiful drive with lakes and views
17,2013-08-27,['scenic driving'],It is a nice ride up through some surprising country.
18,2013-01-17,['skiing'],"Beautiful ride in car or motorcycle during spring, summer and autumn. Road is well maintained and is listed as a National Scenic By-Way. In Autumn, the fall tree colors are incredible. In the winter it's a great snowmobile trail. The snow road is still groomed from Salt Creek Canyon to Payson for easy sled riding."
