0,2019-09-02,['hiking'],this was a nice hike we made it to the hidden lake then came back so we didn't get to do all 20 lakes. trail is pretty hard to follow once you hit the rocks but the map got us through it as you'll see we took the scenic route haha.
1,2019-09-01,['hiking'],wonderful little hike to some amazing lakes
2,2019-08-29,"['hiking', 'off trail']",
3,2019-08-23,['hiking'],lots of flowers.   lakes are full.
4,2019-08-17,['hiking'],Hiked on 8/17/19. Iâ€™ve hiked this trail many times and this might have been one on the best! Mosquitos are gone. Wildflowers are beautiful. We hiked the trail counterclockwise and stopped for lunch above the Three Divide Lakes. This hike was v doable even for novice hikers coming from sea level.
5,2019-08-17,['hiking'],One of my favorite hikes up here. You see like 9-10 lakes on the route. Loops are a lot more fun also.
6,2019-08-12,['hiking'],"Ibantik Clyde and Crystal Lake loop.
Went by 24 lakes in all! 
Incredible scenery, lots of wild flowers."
7,2019-08-11,['hiking'],Nice hike with some nice lakes along the way. We ended up camping at Cliff lake instead of Clyde because there were more hammock options there. Some mesquitos out but bug repellent made it almost a non issue
8,2019-07-27,"['hiking', 'bugs']",spent the night at Clyde lake beautiful. my first solo backpacking my pack was a little heavy 30lbs need to get alot lighter. plenty of bugs.
9,2019-07-26,"['hiking', 'bugs']",camping solo for the First time time. it's beautiful my pack is to heavy
10,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'bugs']","Shady, scenery less spectacular than cottonwood canyon, but pleasant none the less. would make a good first backpacking trip."
11,2019-07-17,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']",
12,2019-07-12,"['hiking', 'bugs']",fantastic views!! lots o bugs
13,2019-07-06,"['backpacking', 'blowdown', 'muddy', 'rocky', 'snow']",
14,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'snow']","Beautiful, short, moderately trafficked...the doggo loved it! A little snow still on trail "
15,2018-08-18,[''],"if you are doing this trail, then do the entire loop."
16,2018-07-23,[''],"Fun hike, lots of people..."
17,2018-07-08,[''],"Great hike. Beautiful campground at Booker lake. Did the loop from Wall lake to Clyde and back to the parking lot.  Mountain sheep right in camp. If you are looking for seclusion, look somewhere else."
18,2017-09-13,['hiking'],It's great up here right now. The cooler weather is keeping most of the crowds away and you can still find wild raspberries and gooseberries to snack on the whole way!
19,2017-08-23,[''],One of my favorite places
20,2017-08-01,['hiking'],This was a pretty mellow hike as far as the trial goes. I really enjoyed it because there are a handful of lakes you can explore if you take the loop. Wildflowers are in full bloom right now too.
21,2017-07-16,[''],"Moderate hike with a rare climb here and there. Many lakes, each looking different from the last. The best view comes from the area surrounding Clyde Lake. Worth the drive from Salt Lake."
22,2017-07-10,['backpacking'],"Spent two days backpacking & exploring around the entire loop and the trail was very easy to follow even though there was quite a bit of snow still in some places. Views from the Notch are incredible and can't be beat for the effort required to get there. A lot of bang for your buck up here, and some of the easiest high wilderness backcountry there is really, even if all you're interested in is a day hike. Next trip I'll have to go climb Mount Watson, and I definitely wont leave the fishing pole home either. Such beautiful country!"
23,2017-07-03,[''],"awesome trail......hiked from Crystal lake trail head to cliff lake camped....got up the next morning and hiked to Clyde lake and camped..... fishing was awesome....lots of little Brooke's.....weather was perfect.....hiked out around Alpine,hope and wall lake...June 30th  to July 2nd"
24,2017-06-25,['hiking'],Biutifull  hiking
25,2017-06-22,[''],Love this hike. I've been doing this hike with my dad for years.
26,2017-06-20,['camping'],This is one of my favorite hike when I am back packing. I will do the loop.
27,2016-10-31,['hiking'],"Took the family up to do this hike over the weekend but did it as a loop... up to Clyde Lake (2m), then over to where it connects with the Notch Mountain Trail (1m), then down the east side of Wall Lake (2.5m) for a total of 5.5 miles.  The Clyde Lake side of this loop is *nowhere* near as ""heavily trafficked"" as the Notch Mountain Trail side (as you can tell by the trail conditions) but it was a nice easy route to follow with lakes everywhere!"
28,2016-07-14,['backpacking'],Like Steve said. It's perfect for a beginning backpacker. Took my son in his first trip this weekend. Gorgeous scenery all around and ample camping. An easy day hike too.
29,2015-08-02,['hiking'],"This is the perfect hike for the beginner backpacker, or for someone that really wants to get a quick taste of the Uintas, without spending days doing strenuous hikes. 
The trailhead starts at the Crystal Lake Trailhead, but you will very quickly leave this trail. You'll come upon a sign for ""Cliff Lake"", turn right here toward Cliff Lake. From here, you go through several series of flat meadows, separated by fairly steep, but very brief, climbs to gain 50-100 feet elevation. In each series, you get a new lake, new meadow, and new views. All the while, Mt. Watson is dominating the view to the West. 
There are several short hikes you can do once you set up camp there. We also did a quick hike out to ""The Notch"", and several other lakes in the surrounding area. 
You'll have plenty of water at your fingertips for this one. In fact, there was a natural spring on the south side of Divide Lake 3 that you can use for clean water. Just look for the break in the meadow/grass on the south side of the lake, and follow the break up toward Mt. Watson. We all drank from it, and nobody got sick ;)"
30,2009-08-17,[''],"This was the destination of an annual backpack trip that I do with my son and a few friends. It was the second attempt to get to Clyde Lake, and we almost didn't make it again. The trail is a bit confusing at times, and we had to hike off-trail for about .5 miles to get to our destination. The area is beautiful in the late summer-perfect for a nice getaway."
31,1987-07-01,['backpacking'],This is a nice trail that can be hiked with a little older children because of the distance. It passes several other lakes and ends in an open area near many other lakes. By heading east you can take the notch mountain trail to Wall lake and back to the Crystal Lake Trailhead for a nice loop
