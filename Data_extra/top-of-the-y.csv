0,2019-08-23,['hiking'],Hard to get to because of closed road. Very hot and steep. First and only time I will do this hike haha.
1,2019-08-06,['hiking'],I would never recommend this to my worst enemy
2,2019-07-30,"['hiking', 'no shade', 'scramble']","First off when I selected this trail I assumed that the Y was some sort of geological feature. It is in fact a giant concrete Y made by BYU students over 100 years ago. It’s pretty cool, but it’s not the peak of the mountain.

Reading some of these reviews, I think it’s easy for you folks out west to take for granted how beautiful your mountains are. Some folks said the views weren’t that great. I think it’s definitely worth the climb.

This trail is all uphill and it’s pretty steep. For an East Coaster like me who is not used to the elevation it’s pretty challenging."
3,2019-07-24,['hiking'],felt like absolute crap. Quality times. 
4,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'no shade']","I rather enjoy this hike because you see all of Utah County. You do, admittedly, do this more to say you did it than because it’s beautiful scenery. There’s a ton of history and heritage that goes along with the Y and it’s something everyone should do at least once. Also, take some time and continue on past the top of the Y, it instantly gets way more pretty and less crowded. Bring lots of water!"
5,2019-07-14,"['hiking', 'no shade']","You haven't been to Provo of you haven't hiked the Y, but once you've done it once you've no need to do it again. Unless you want to run it--then it's wonderful exercise. Not as exciting or beautiful as other nearby hikes, though."
6,2019-06-21,"['hiking', 'no shade']","Kind of boring, honestly. And hot because there was no shade. Just did it to say I did."
7,2019-06-19,"['hiking', 'no shade']","nice little trail. its pretty steep and theres no shade, but it's one of those hikes everyone should do at least once."
8,2019-06-03,[''],"Worth doing once. It's just really steep, and not terribly pretty"
9,2019-05-29,"['hiking', 'no shade']","This is the classic Provo hike but as is not that great as far as hikes go. You have the exact same view of Utah valley the entire way up,l so the only reward is seeing white plaster rocks up close that form the famous “Y” on the mountain. 

Don’t get me wrong, this is a great family hike. It’s simple (although steep), short, and the trail is well maintained and marked. 

I just feel like it is WAY overrated as there is nothing fun during the hike (no changes in scenery) and no reward at the end of the hike (like a waterfall or previously unavailable view). If you continue all the way up to the peak, though, you do get those things."
10,2019-05-24,[''],Steep switchbacks all the way up. it's a leg burner for sure.
11,2019-05-16,['hiking'],"Fairly steep, short in distance, and rewarding!"
12,2019-05-16,"['hiking', 'rocky']",Love this hike when I’m short on time and want some good exercise and great views. 
13,2019-05-06,['hiking'],Great short steep hike 10/10 would recommend.
14,2019-05-04,['hiking'],Steep and not so long. Great view in the top! My boys love do this hike!
15,2019-04-28,"['hiking', 'no shade']","took the dogs on this one and ran out of water by the time we got to the top.  started the hike with nice cloud coverage but that didnt last long.  pups got pretty over heated.  Fun hike, steep but pretty short.  Down heel the legs were a little wobbly.  next time take more water."
16,2019-04-10,"['hiking', 'muddy']",
17,2019-04-09,"['hiking', 'scramble']",4 yews! Very nice trail. Watch out for the kiddos. They’ll sneak up on ya
18,2019-03-24,"['trail running', 'no shade']","The trail is made well enough that you can run this route if you're able,  but be warned...the way up is quite steep.  The trail ascends via 13 switchbacks on the way to the top of the ""Y"" which gives an incredible view of the valley.   Not too much to see on the trail itself besides the valley views,  but have heard ascending up to the top of the mountain gives chance for more wildlife sightings."
19,2019-02-13,['snow'],Very steep trail with great views of Provo.
20,2019-01-27,"['hiking', 'snow']",Made it just in time for the sunset. It’s a good hike if you wanna work on cardio. There was snow when I started but it frozen by the time I started coming down which made for a slippery adventure. Had to learn to pace myself on this hike. Had a good time and definitely recommend this for everyone of all ages.
21,2018-11-03,[''],"Hard hike, but cool at the top."
22,2018-10-27,[''],
23,2018-09-08,[''],
24,2018-09-05,[''],
25,2018-08-30,['hiking'],"A very steep, dusty trail, but very close to downtown Provo, so it's an easy, quick trip. I did it in an hour - I was very tired going up, and going down was very slippery with all the loose dirt and rocks. 
All that said, I enjoyed it! I didn't have much time so I'm glad I was able to get a quick one in."
26,2018-08-29,['hiking'],"This was a lot more challenging than I expected, but it was totally worth it when you reach the top. This was really fun and rewarding, everyone we met was friendly and polite."
27,2018-07-26,[''],A very hot and dusty hike. Nothing but steep switchbacks the entire way. I only hike it for a workout.
28,2018-07-25,['hiking'],"This was a tougher then it looks hike.  Like most of the reviews say, bring water.  Take your time and rest when you need to.  It was a good workout coming back down too."
29,2018-06-30,['hiking'],"The only reason I gave this 4 stars is it has interesting signs regarding history, wildlife and vegetation. Hot, steep, dusty, gravel, sunny, and crowded trail. But still a must do if you live near. Good workout.  Took me 15 minutes up and about 8 minutes down."
30,2018-06-17,[''],"I've done this twice now. last time was in August. it's hot, steep, very little shade, but the view is great. I saw lots of little lizards and a rattle snake (please keep an eye out for them!). I prefer hiking in trees so when you need to catch your breath, the sun isn't still beating on you... short hike, hard work. no shade."
31,2018-06-12,['hiking'],"Did this with the kids (15,12,10,8) today.  Yes, it’s steep the whole way, but I’m not sure why so many reviewers say it isn’t pretty.  We went early in the morning and had shade on most of the trail.  The mountains and valley view (yes, there is only one view the whole way) are beautiful.  Plus, it’s great to have a destination for the kids to reach, one that they can see from the freeway and say, “Wow!  That Y is high up the mountain...and I hiked to it!”   P.S. If you need to, you can bribe them with a trip to The Creamery if they keep a positive attitude while hiking!  We all enjoyed this hike, but I probably had the most fun since I could relive my college days at BYU with my kids."
32,2018-06-10,['hiking'],I hate this hike because of The switchbacks and there being not much to look at.  But if you want to hike to the summit then you gotta push through this mess first.  It’s a good beginner hike as it can be tough.
33,2018-05-24,['hiking'],Good workout. The trail itself is very boring. Views are good at the top. Worth doing once.
34,2018-05-21,[''],"The only thing that makes this hike somewhat worth the boring switchbacks is just being able to say “I hiked the Y.” If you’re in it for the beauty, don’t waste your time with this one. It’s dry and boring all the way up. But a fun group of friends will help!"
35,2018-04-14,[''],"Lots of switchbacks, great views"
36,2018-03-05,['hiking'],The switchback take some of the steepness out of this hike. Busy even in the morning
