0,2019-09-07,['hiking'],"Nice walk for people who are starting to get in shape. There was some shade at beginning and a few little backtracks in the middle due to lack of signs. It's a little noisy because of the freeway. But all in all, a pleasant outing that took 1.5 hours. "

2,2019-08-15,['hiking'],"Enjoyable hike. The first mile is a trail, the second mile is road walking and the last of the trial is walking the Bonneville shoreline trail back to the parking lot. Great hike for kids (took a 4 year old and 7 year old)."
3,2019-08-14,['hiking'],Great trail if you’re looking for an easy hike! Pretty views and great trail condition.
4,2019-08-05,['hiking'],The trail fits its description as easy. The hiking trail is a perfect morning or evening easy hike. It provides views of the golf course below and surrounding area. 
5,2019-08-02,['hiking'],"This hike was ok but definitely not one of my favorites. The first part of the trail was great, but after the first half we kept getting lost as the trail isn't well marked and there are several other trails that connect. Walking through the neighborhood was confusing, too. The second half of the trail had almost no shade so it was hot, dry, and lots of long, dead grass. We did get to see two old wrecked cars on the trail, and an old washing machine, which was a highlight for the kids. I think I might enjoy this hike more when it's not such a hot day, and I'd only do the first half, then turn around and go back. "
6,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"really a great trail for someone out for a nice easy walk. you do have to walk up the street at the halfway point to get to the rest of the trail, but its quiet and quick! alot of birds and nice views along the path! this is one of my go-to trail hikes when I just need to get away for a bit, no planning necessary."
7,2019-07-14,['hiking'],"GREAT trail! Saw a variety of things! Switches from sweeping views to shaded walkways frequently, and gives exposure to a variety of plants and birds.

We started in the Rainbow Planet parking lot. Note that to do the whole loop, you will need to walk partially through a neighborhood about halfway through. Be sure to look for the house with the license plate siding when you do!

Really enjoyed this hike. "
8,2019-06-29,['hiking'],The hike was a good one for a beginners hike. there is shade along the trail and some open sun patches. I didn't go through the residential portion - went to the top of the trail and turned around. beautiful hike!
9,2019-06-24,['bird watching'],"Yikes!  I’d been on the trail last year, but it has deteriorated since then.  There are a few spots that are very narrow with sharp dropoffs, and downright frightening when you’re approached by a mountain biker coming at you from the opposite direction.  Not recommended for young kids or dogs.  "
10,2019-06-24,"['hiking', 'washed out']","There are parts of this trail that are absolutely gorgeous, but there are other parts that are in need of serious repair. Mountain bikers, and similar heavy traffic, have been using this trail when it is muddy which is causing deep ruts as well as rapid deterioration of parts of the trail. One section has only a couple feet of tread left before it is completely gone. "
11,2019-06-08,[''],"we loved the first half very beautiful an loved the sounds of nature, odd walking through a neighborhood to get to the second half, kool surprise on the second half but very rocky an not as breath taking as the first half but will defenitly do the first half again but turn around at the top. "
12,2019-06-01,['hiking'],"We like doing this hike with toddlers, it’s a great training hike to help the little ones! Just quick and easy trail. Even fun for kids on their bikes. "
13,2019-05-27,['hiking'],This was a fun hike that I’ve up to it’s name. We could hear the birds throughout the entire hike. We did it in a weeknight and it took less than an hour. Easy hike and beautiful views for the first half. The second half was not as pretty.
14,2019-05-27,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'washed out']",beautiful trail in the springtime. you could hear a lot of birds. one section was washed out but not too bad. honestly the scariest part of the trail is going on City streets with no sidewalks. we had a 3 year old and a 6 year old hiking with us.
15,2019-05-26,['hiking'],"Dog friendly, super easy, partially shaded, nice views. Would be cautious after rains. "
16,2019-05-06,['hiking'],This is not family friendly!! The beginning is nice & easy but then it becomes narrow & steep. Had a baby in a carrier so we turned around & went back. Scary if you or your child missteps because it's a pretty far fall. Don't recommend for children or people carrying children unless you are comfortable with steep & narrow!!
17,2019-04-18,"['hiking', 'blowdown', 'washed out']",Nice simple hike. Some parts were blown out by a mud slide.
18,2019-04-18,['hiking'],"Decent afternoon hike with the kids. You are sharing the trail with mountain bikers and runners, but everyone is super cautious of each other and you can hear people coming from a while off. Don’t forget to download the Geocaching app before going. There’s a few along this trail. Enjoy"
19,2019-04-13,['hiking'],Not as muddy as we expected! but wear good shoes.
20,2019-04-06,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'off trail']","Athena did well, trail goes onto the street for a bit but great hike overall."
21,2019-04-01,['hiking'],"Easy little hike. Hiked down from 22nd to Rainbow Gardens, then came back up Birdsong. Would be easy with pets. If hiking with children, be aware there are drop offs. Was afraid it would be icy or muddy this early in the year, but it was pretty dry. There is an area where a mudslide occurred, but it didn’t affect the trail too badly. Just soft ground there. Too early for rattlesnakes, but I’ve heard they were bad last year."
22,2019-03-30,['hiking'],Trail could have been marked better. We got lost/turned around at the residential outcropping.
23,2018-10-15,[''],Love this trail! Easy for the littles and shady in most spots.
24,2018-06-28,['hiking'],"this was ok, fairly short but peaceful. there is an area that is iffy for smaller kids so I would hold tight to them."
25,2018-06-10,[''],"Nice little hike. there is a section that has really wasted away next to a drop-off, so be careful with the little kids."
26,2018-05-30,['nature trips'],
27,2018-05-29,['hiking'],My kids and I have done this hike so many times! We love it. The only down fall is the amount of rattle snakes.  Just vigilant and you’ll have a great experience!
28,2018-05-07,['hiking'],"My wife and I are out of shape, but were still able to do the loop.  It was nice for the most part.  Could still hear a lot of traffic.  Good markings for the most part, but the northwest corner on the high part of the trail isn't marked.  I would recommend this for novices."
29,2018-05-06,[''],Great for kids. By far our favorite trail. There’s a cute little waterfall about 2/3 of the way through (if you start at Rainbow Gardens) and a bench to sit on.
30,2018-04-24,[''],It's a great trail for beginner's
31,2018-04-23,['hiking'],Hiked with the family nice trail for all level of hikers.  Watch out for bikers.
32,2017-10-30,['walking'],"Eh, it was alright. Not much to see once you get through the initial part of the trail. And you end up walking behind people's houses at one point."
33,2017-10-24,[''],Kids loved it.  Adults were okay with it.
34,2017-10-16,['hiking'],"Great trail for kids of all ages.
Spend the day on the trail and get a snack at Rainbow Gardens"
35,2017-10-05,[''],Some steep parts but good for hikers with no physical limitations.
36,2017-07-06,['hiking'],fun and easy trail.
37,2017-06-06,['hiking'],"Nice hike but the neighborhood part would have been confusing if we hadn't had the trail map on our phones. Plenty of birds,  wild flowers and shade."
38,2017-05-31,[''],"Would had given it a 4-star trail. However, the constant interference of mountain bikers a bit annoying.  Considering there are some narrow paths along ridge line.    Does have a great stopping area midway through the hike for the kiddo's. Perfect distance if you have little ones."
39,2017-04-28,[''],Ends in a neighborhood lol
40,2017-02-23,['hiking'],"Very easy, kids could do this fun little hike."
41,2017-02-14,['snowshoeing'],fun!!!
42,2016-09-06,[''],"Bird song trail has two options 1- up and back 
2- do the loop . 
1- up and back park in the south west back corner parking lot at Rainbow Gardens the trail head has s large wooden sign over head , trail forks stay right , traveling up along a hill then overlooking the golf course , threw some trees resting at the bench .
There's a small stream of water to enjoy . Continue along trail up to the end of the hike at the l neighborhood street . 
2- loop continue hiking threw the neighborhood reaching the 22nd street parking area , head up the trail to your left staying left dropping down into the small basin below shore line trail . Note there are trail markers to keep you on the right path , bird song trail .
Continue winding your way back to rainbow gardens . You know your on the right path when you see some very old 1908 to 2930 old cars stop and check them out . 
Soon you arrive back to your car . 
4 miles round trip fun hike great to get in shape"
43,2016-08-15,['hiking'],"Not one of my favorites because you're constantly moving out of the way for mountain bikers. It also seems that this trail has taken quite a beating over the years, too. There are several different spots where the trail has given way, and completely fallen off from excessive use. But I used to walk this trail a lot with my grandmother when I was a kid, and always loved it. Stop in for some lunch or dinner afterward at Rainbow Gardens! It's usually only about an hour or so to complete."
44,2016-07-25,['hiking'],"This was a good first hike for us, too. Not much bird activity."
45,2016-06-29,['hiking'],"This was my first hike. Easy starter hike, very scenic. Not too long, but as others have said, it does get confusing when you reach the neighborhood and have to find where the trail reconnects."
46,2016-06-28,[''],Great family hike. The kids did great. Lots of shade. My only complaint is that you end up walking through a neighborhood for a while and it isn't completely clear where to go so we ended up turned around for a bit.
47,2016-06-24,[''],"we didn't finish the whole thing, were confused by coming up into a city. we still enjoyed it and plan to go the backend next time so we can see the cars."
48,2016-06-10,[''],It's ok for a quick little easy walk. Probably a great place to take small children. I prefer the other hikes available nearby however
49,2016-04-10,[''],This is a good trail. Just be aware that for about 1/5 of it you have to walk through a neighborhood.
50,2015-08-30,['hiking'],"Short accessible hike with lots of shade. Minimal elevation gain. A little underwhelming, but excellent for those looking to get away from the heat for a nature walk."
51,2015-07-19,['hiking'],Short hike perfect for kids. Some windflowers and view of ogden canyon.
52,2015-06-04,['hiking'],"How to Get There: Take the 12th St. exit in Ogden and turn east. Go until you're almost at the base of the mountain, you will see the Rainbow Gardens sign and business on the right side of the road, right before you enter the canyon. The parking lot is just past the building. Head to the south-west corner for parking and the trail head. 

This was a great hike, especially for kids. About 2/3 of it was shaded, and none of it was very steep. I've never seen so many varieties of wildflowers, they were beautiful! My 7 and 4 year old did really well. We only saw one very small stream, but so many birds, dragonflies and lizards. The bench at the top is perfect to take a break and have a small snack before heading back down. Fun, short trail."
53,2015-04-23,['hiking'],"Nice short little trail. There is a shady area on top with a bench that's quite peaceful. It was quiet when I went up, but can be busy depending on the season and time of day."
54,2015-04-22,['hiking'],"Well used trail and for being so short it has a lot to offer. It has views, little creeks, benches, shade. But is also has a lot of use happening. Expect to see hikers, runners, walkers, dogs, bikers, and kids running about. All in all a great little trail but a little to busy for my taste."
55,2015-04-16,['hiking'],It nice to see everyone adding some of these trails to the site.  This is just one of many possible places you can hike starting from the Rainbow Parking Lot.  I enjoyed this little hike on many occasions.  I even have a Geocache hidden somewhere along the way.
56,2015-02-17,['hiking'],"This is a great short and easy hike that is ideal for kids.  There is plenty of parking at the Rainbow parking lot.  Make sure to find the spots marked with a snowflake, as these are for public parking.  The other spots are for Rainbow customers.  The trail takes your through a couple of neat ""microclimates"".  There are some nice shady spots for resting or a snack.  The trail also winds you up to an elevated area that provides a nice view of Ogden.  Take water or buy a bottle at Rainbow.  Watch out for the occasional mountain biker."
57,2014-06-29,['hiking'],"Great trail. My 3 yr old and my 6 yr old we're able to navigate it just fine. There's some shady spots, some sunny spots, a few beautiful overlooks, and even a small creek. We'd definitely do it again."
58,2014-05-03,['hiking'],Good trail for kids and family or a quick getaway. My Garmin tracked it at 1.75miles out and back so it is a little longer than the description states but still a very easy and nice hike.
