1,2019-09-02,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'rocky']","Lots of shade on this hike. Would definitely recommend hiking shoes especially after reaching the waterfall. The habitat changed from rocky to soft sand every km, is a bit slippery on the elevation. Overall good hike, would recommend. "
2,2019-08-26,"['hiking', 'over grown', 'scramble']","Aug. 26 update. Nice and shaded, so a good hike for a dog in late summer. Stream bed is extremely dry until more than a mile in, so you may want to pack extra water for the pup. As others have noted, the real ""fun"" doesn't start until almost 1.75 miles when you see the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest wood sign. From there on, it's narrow ledges, steep slopes and eventually so overgrown it ceases being navigable. 

After the little waterfall about 1.85 miles in, I scrambled up the slope grabbing tree roots to hold onto with my dog (who also had a hard time with it) and got into the forest. You'll see a rock cairn at almost the 2 mile point but it is not clear which way to the meadow. I tried going left but hit the stream again and it seemed like a dead end. I walked back to the cairn and walked down a little bit (downhill) but got too spooked by the overgrowth to continue. It is that thick. If there are more experienced hikers, I think leaving a few cairns or tree markers would help the rest of us muddle our way to the meadow. That or a machete. "
3,2019-08-23,['hiking'],"Loved it, except for the fact that there were at least 5 dog owners that had not cleaned up."
4,2019-08-22,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']","We did this hike last sunday. we were told that it's usually filled with water however it was extremely dry  While the first 2 miles up were a great steep hike, after that the trail became very overgrown until you reach the meadow. There are not really any view points and once you got there it wasn't clear where to go. We eventually figured it out but gave up after how much overgrown brush we had to Wade through. we made it 3 miles out so only missed another .2 or so, however I don't think there was much more. Would recommend stopping at the meadow."
5,2019-08-18,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","Shaded even at noon day. A few overgrown sections. Beautiful hike. Not many people for a weekend, especially past the 30 minute mark. Polite dog owners, with well behaved dogs. Hiking shoes recommended due to rocky terrain and scramble."
6,2019-08-17,['hiking'],"Rocky, only made it 1.5 miles in so didn't get the full view. Nice to go on side trails"
7,2019-08-10,"['hiking', 'over grown']",
8,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']","As it seems like many often do, we experienced this trail on account of missing the loop. Frankly, I’m pleased we ended up taking this route. I’d describe this hike as moderate. Nothing major, but it’s uphill and rocky for much of the way. The views are great, you’re surrounded by forest and you get to see the vegetation change with the elevation. I’m definitely returning to this trail in the future. 

One note - We saw many dogs off leash, and the trail was littered with poo bags near the trailhead. Another reminder to observe proper etiquette and treat our public spaces respectfully."

11,2019-07-26,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']",Trail was amazing my only complaint would have to be that the trail is very over grown once you get deeper into the trail. Otherwise great hike and great exercise
12,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']",Hiked from Wildcat ridge to the Neff Trailhead. 3.6 miles. Had one mile of driving before I shut off the recording.
13,2019-07-24,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']",Great trail for quick day hike.
14,2019-07-23,"['hiking', 'scramble']",
15,2019-07-23,['hiking'],"This one is steep and shaded and doesn't end in a summit (figured after a long time hiking). The path is well-trodden and crosses near a river. As you get farther up, the path becomes narrow and overgrown. A tree branch near the top has a little bell on it."
16,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"Wanted to do this hike with my dog and hubby. I seen it was dog friendly and noticed 95% of the dogs weren’t on leashes. We hiked a quarter of the way and then turned back because of all the dogs. 
Other than that the view and hike was great. 
Seen one snake.

18,2019-07-13,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown']","Hit the trail at 7am Saturday, July 13. Took 1.5 hours up and 1 hour down, and I saw about a dozen people on the way down. Trail is a beautiful climb through the woods, although mostly a moderate difficulty and not too tough. No point in going past the first meadow, .4 miles to the end, because this trail doesn't really have a summit."
19,2019-07-10,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown', 'rocky', 'scramble']",It was so amazing!!! Our dogs loved it!!! My friend and I met at 9am and it was pretty shady. I probably wouldn’t start any later then that because the sun hits pretty hard after 11am. It is really buggy so definitely wear bug spray! I’m pretty sure I killed 5 bugs directly on my face. We went up for about 3 miles and decided to turn back. We wish we saw the meadow??? Is there a meadow?? Were we in the meadow the whole time?? Plenty of water for dogs throughout! Overall awesome experience!

21,2019-07-10,['hiking'],"Surprised to find the trailhead parking lot half full on a Tuesday. Then we learned that most people -- especially those with kids -- head straight for the nearby creek in the woods. Apparently, it's a great place to play and cool off on a hot day. The trail was pretty nice too, as it's mostly shaded and it follows a creek much of the way. Our dog loved it."
22,2019-07-07,['hiking'],great for dogs very very steep not sure if I did the whole thing but turned around because it go so steep. Beautiful hike though.
23,2019-07-07,['hiking'],"Great trail to bring dogs, 
Also I found a pair of evzero Oakley sunglasses on the trail (7/6/2019). Email me with the colors of your lost glasses and I will get them back to you (rsgoldstein@hotmail.com) "
24,2019-07-03,['hiking'],"Hiked this Saturday 6/29. Definitely wear sunscreen and bring bug spray! Only the last mile seemed a little ridiculously steep. But I loved it! Such a great trail and the meadow is so scenic. Try to get there early 8am, midday 12pm, or late in the day, to be guaranteed a spot in the parking lot. It makes for a great spring conditioning hike!"
25,2019-07-02,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']","We did this hike last night and found it to be a worthwhile endeavor. Be prepared for several small stream crossings and lots of bugs! The pooches loved the water and shade on the trail. That said, I would strongly advise turning around at the pleasant meadow about .4 miles from the end point listed here as the actual end point is shall we say uninspiring. We found very little snow on the trail, but still plenty of mud. My hiking partner seems to have dropped his phone on the trail, so if you come across an iPhone SE please drop me a line at 312-550-6381. We did our best to LNT, I swear!  "
26,2019-06-29,['trail running'],perfect morning for a run. you'll have to navigate some streams but it's in great condition otherwise
27,2019-06-27,['hiking'],"LOVE this trail. Lots of cute doggos and friendly people. It does climb quite a bit in some areas but totally doable! The meadow at the top is so peaceful and pretty. There’s snow after about 2,900 feet of climbing-so you can’t easily access Thaynes Peak. I would suggest micro spikes right now. "
28,2019-06-24,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","Great trail for a day hike. Pretty consistent incline the whole way and 3-5 water crossings depending on your route. It's doable in trail runners but the snow at the top makes poles or spikes a good add on. I lost the trail a few hundred yards after the meadow but in my opinion there's nothing much up there but pines and a few aspens so you're not missing much at ""the top"". Great views from the meadow though! "
29,2019-06-23,"['hiking', 'snow']",This is one of my favorite hikes in Salt Lake City. In the winter and spring it feels like Narnia. The slush near the meadow is pretty grueling when the snow melts though. Make sure to pack your micro spikes! 
30,2019-06-22,"['trail running', 'rocky']",
31,2019-06-19,['hiking'],Watch out for rattlesnakes... 
32,2019-06-18,['hiking'],Still a lot of water in the crossings on June 18th. You will get wet feet. Good hike to get the heart rate going in the morning.
33,2019-06-10,['hiking'],"Cool trail, super dog friendly, but lots of people. If you cross the river a couple times the trial is much better but very steep. "
34,2019-06-08,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'washed out']","About 2 miles in, you reach some washed out trails. Had to cross water twice but worth it. Enjoyed the views & the shade while hiking. You follow the river both ways & cross it a couple times before it gets too crazy. I’ll be going back when the rivers are lower. Couldn’t cross without having to walk in water. Sandals or water shoes would have been ideal but the water was freezing."
35,2019-06-04,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'washed out']","This trail is fun with pups! Lots of water run off from a very snowy winter. Fast rushing water Blocked the upper part of the trail. If you don’t want to get your feet wet or you pups don’t like water, I don’t recommend this time of year. "
36,2019-06-02,"['hiking', 'rocky', 'scramble']",
37,2019-06-02,['hiking'],I didn’t go as far as I wanted based on time of day and at the second stream crossing I didn’t see anyway not to get my feet completely wet.  But will do again. Nice shade and not many people.
38,2019-05-29,['hiking'],Two moose encounters and lots of people. Not a good hike with dogs.
39,2019-05-19,"['muddy', 'snow']","definite challenge this time of year. I would highly suggest as another user mentioned, bring an extra pair of socks.  I would suggest a spare pair of wool socks. don't change them until you get passed the water flowing down the trail like a water fall.  there will be one more water crossing after that if you can manage to wait.  snow near the top is waist deep if you are falling through. love this hike, can't wait to do it again before the snow is all gone. "
40,2019-05-11,['hiking'],"Very steep, snow starts pretty quickly but it's well packed. My pup loved all the flowing streams. I had to stop around the 2.5 mile mark because it just got too steep and snowy. I will 100% be doing this hike again once the snow melts."
41,2019-04-30,['hiking'],Very steep
42,2019-04-28,"['hiking', 'bridge out', 'snow']","4-38-19 still snow from a mile in and up. Wet but doable even without crampons, just slow. Melting but seems like it would be there at least another week."
43,2019-04-21,[''],great dog stroll
44,2019-04-20,"['hiking', 'snow']","Went up today and had to turn back before I got to the end, the further up you go the worse the trail condition gets. Near the top, I think only a few have gone, so you end up post-holing in a couple feet of snow. I would recommend good waterproof shoes, microspikes, and poles if you go in the next couple weeks or so."
45,2019-02-25,['hiking'],"I hiked a portion of this trail on one of the warmer days so the snow was a bit softer in some areas. Right now it’s hard pack snow because of the hikers, sleds, skis and snowboards but was easy to hike with my microspikes. I’d highly recommend listening for the people skiing/sledding down the trail because you won’t see them first and if you have your dog with you they may not see the pup."
46,2019-02-16,['hiking'],"Steep trail, but great for sledding and hiking. I hiked it with only my Yak-Traks and was fine, though I wish I had brought poles."
47,2019-02-12,['hiking'],So fun to hike in the snow—for sure use crampons
48,2019-01-13,[''],"Gorgeous trail, and best of all dogs are allowed every day!"
49,2019-01-09,[''],Super pretty with all the snow. A bit steep. Fun to see people sledding and skiing down!
50,2018-12-24,['hiking'],"Awesome hike to bring along the puppers! 

:-) 

Great views and an exciting way to see the North side of Olympus. 

Should have brought my snowshoes, was tempted to explore the ridgeline ... 

Another time ..."
51,2018-11-28,['hiking'],It was a beautiful winter hike! Definitely recommend bringing yak-tracks or crampons for the slicker parts.
52,2018-11-20,[''],Didn't go the whole way but had beautiful views and a wide enough path for people to pass. Took my dog and everyone seemed very friendly and welcomed him with pets. Not all the snow melts so make sure you wear good hiking shoes with grip.
53,2018-10-20,[''],"Trail is definitely uphill the entire way, deserves its ranking. We went last week and it was pretty snowy at the top so it was very muddy and slick. Views were pretty but just okay. Meadow was full of snow."
54,2018-09-03,[''],"My wife and I did this a couple days ago. It took us about 4 hours round trip, but we kept a pretty decent pace the entire way. It is straight up just about the entire way - bring lots of water! It is beautiful hiking with mixtures of pine and aspen trees, wildflower meadows and steep canyons. The view of SLC in the pictures is from the very beginning, not the top (we found that out on our way down after no view of the city at the top). At the top you can continue right or left on further trails that will take you up to the peaks. That was about 3.5+ miles in, so we turned around. Overall hike ended up more around 8.0 miles round trip. As others said, keep right at the first few Y-intersections."
55,2018-07-09,['hiking'],Did this hike today. Closer to 7.1 miles. Beautiful trail but definitely hard with lots of loose rocks. Suggest taking extra water especially if you have dogs. Took the hammocks up and rested at the top of the trail. Flies and other bugs pretty bad right now. Definitely a challenging hike both the ascent and descent. But so worth it at the top.
56,2018-07-05,[''],I don’t think I’ve ever made it to the top...but it is beautiful! Especially in the winter. Gets incredibly slippery with ice during winter so I suggest not wearing nikes during the winter. Would go again and my dog loves the hike!
57,2018-07-05,['hiking'],"The trail starts out very rocky with sections that nothing but loose rock.  Fortunately this disappears after roughly a mile and half in.  Be sure to keep right as you come to the  first few trail junctions as these will put you on the loop or on some trail.

It doesn't take long for the grade to increase and is more or less sustained throughout the hike.  There is plenty of shade and some opportunities for water as of June 1. 

At the end is a trail junction marked by a large cairn.  Left will take you to Desolation Trail and right will put you on the Wildcat Ridge trail.  If you go right, it isn't long before you will reach a saddle overlooking Big Cottonwood Canyon - a spectacular view.  If you plan to climb the peak to the left, do not follow the trail over the saddle, it will only make the endeavor much more difficult.  Other peaks are nearby if you're interested in bagging a few.

Overall the hike is worth the effort if you decide to capture the view from the saddle or bag a few peaks.  The trail is accurately rated as difficult."
58,2018-07-04,[''],Steep and sustained but awesome shadey hike!  Upper trail dead ends at a fork with the mt Olympus trail. We didn’t go past this point. Bet there are some good views from up there.
59,2018-06-16,['hiking'],Just hiked this trail today. Uphill all the way with only a few flat spots along the way. Not much water on the lower half but a spot or two toward the top. Pushed past the end of the trail and continued on to the ridge line to enjoy an amazing view and restful kip in some hammocks. Took us about 4.5 hours to make it up and back with a 30 min nap at the top.
60,2018-06-14,['hiking'],"Hiked this on June 11. In from out of town and was curious what a “hard” hike was really like. Did not disappoint! Definitely a work out and the view was worth it! The trail actually ends at a junction instead of at the meadow, we added a rock to the pile once done!"
61,2018-06-13,[''],Great family hike today. 7 adults and 3 kids. Great views.
62,2018-06-07,[''],"Fun hike.  Good leg burner, stream and little waterfall, shade in many areas and great views of the valley and the meadow at the top.  Great workout. I definitely recommend it."
63,2018-05-26,['hiking'],Did this trail last weekend.  Ran down the trail to find a rattlesnake literally on the lower third of the trail.  I found this to be one of the better hikes in Utah. Steep and rugged and crosses streams.  Loved it.  Will do it again
64,2018-05-22,[''],Hiked up to the saddle on 5/19. There was a couple feet of snow the last mile starting about a half mile above the meadow. Wonderful hike. There are three or four water crossings this time of year. But I was able to make it without getting my feet wet. Don’t let the full parking lot at he trailhead fool you— 90% of those people will be hanging out along the creek in the maple groves along the first mile of trail.
65,2018-05-21,['hiking'],hiked this trail for the first time 5/20. waterfall is raging right now. this time of year not for anyone uncomfortable with creek crossings. trekking poles would have been good for crossing the falls and the steep downhill. above the large meadow youll hit snow. follow the tracks through the snow and youll make it up to the ridge overlooking BCC but be sure to bring spikes for the way back down. will probably melt in a week or 2.
66,2018-05-12,['hiking'],"Amazing hike! Hiked it today 5/12 (first time) in the fog rain and it was wet and wonderful!!! A bit challenging to find, but worth it. (Stay to the left and watch for log crossings and rock cairns when you’re not sure of the trail.)"
67,2018-04-30,[''],very beautiful trail with great views  creek is dried up right now. And it is a steep and hard hike.
68,2018-04-29,[''],Make sure to wear hiking shoes lots of rocks and little steep but overall nice hike lots of shade - my dog seem to enjoy it 
69,2018-04-21,['hiking'],Really enjoyed the upper meadow is was very lush.
70,2018-04-11,['hiking'],Neffs canyon is my dogs favorite!
71,2018-02-02,[''],Love this hike! First time going and the scenery is beautiful! Wear your micro spikes or you’ll have a hard/funny time coming down ;)
72,2017-11-25,[''],Gorgeous view! Can see the whole city view on the mountain
73,2017-10-14,['hiking'],Beautiful right now!
74,2017-09-29,['hiking'],"This is an easily accessible hike for those in the SLC area. The trail rating of 'hard' is certainly accurate as it is quite steep and there are lots of portions with uneven footing. Not very trafficked, but most everyone on the trail brings their dogs (myself included) and lets them roam off-leash so if you aren't an animal lover this might not be for you. My full description of the hike can be found below:

https://www.kelseykagan.com/home/2017/8/31/neffs-canyon"
75,2017-09-26,[''],"Try to hike it today, but to much snow. What i saw was beautyfull."
76,2017-09-17,[''],"Love this hike! There must be two routes. When leaving the parking lot the one on the left is on a pebble paved route that's easier. To the right is a more challenging route. But it's amazing! A lot of rocks and boulders. It's uphill and coming back the hardest part is not rolling your ankle. About 2 miles in the trail gets kind of lost with the fallen trees and foliage, but it picks up about 1/4 mile later. Didn't get much farther because the sun was starting to go down around 6 pm. I'll be going back for sure next week to explore it more."
77,2017-09-05,[''],Steep rocky and hot to the rope swing. Fun but the creek was mostly dried up when we got there.
78,2017-08-24,['hiking'],This is my favorite trail in the vicinity of Salt Lake City. It's beautiful.
79,2017-08-20,['hiking'],"I took the south trail to the right at the rope swing heading up a rocky trail - slightly steeper climb, fewer people, no bikes (the trail is too rocky) - sweet solitude - beautiful transitions thru the lower deciduous trees to tall pines. One of my favorite trails."
80,2017-08-10,[''],"There are a million and one off-shoot trails branching off in every which way in this canyon and it's easy to get lost.  You'll be on the right path (generally, at least) if you just follow the base of the canyon as it ascends up the drainage."
81,2017-08-10,['hiking'],"Very nice hike with some challenging spots. Tree cover most of the hike, so it's nice and cool on a hot day. We hiked past the waterfall a mile or so, hoping for a view of the valley but never did see one, nevertheless, it's a great hike, even for dogs!
There's plenty of parking, no drinking water or bathroom though. No bikes, too rocky."
82,2017-08-08,[''],Tough hike but the meadow at the top was a great place for relaxing and refueling. Took us 3 hours 45 mins with a half hour break at the top.
83,2017-07-27,['hiking'],"Took the dogs out on a hike with my best friend to grab a few caches while I was in town visiting. I wasn't aware how much of an uphill hike it was and got a little winded, but the views were beautiful. There are several rope swings that are fun to goof around on about a half a mile in which made the uphill treck worth it. I can see how others have gotten lost easily because there really isn't a clear trail and at times it seemed like there were multiple trails that spawn off from the main. Overall good hike just tired and sore."
84,2017-07-18,['hiking'],Saw moose and deer.  Wild flowers are abundant.  Fantastic sunsets.
85,2017-07-13,[''],"Very easy, simple beginner hike, kid and old people friendly:) and there is 2 swings half way through the hike"
86,2017-07-10,['trail running'],"Good:
Lots of cover, stream is awesome, foliage is lovely, super close to civilization

Cons:
Hard to stay on the trail (I lost it 3-4 times), lots of loose rocks, occasional hiking up wash, no real destination

Not a bad morning, but there are better trails."
87,2017-07-09,['hiking'],"Wew, lawd. This was a tough one. I'm an out-of-shape spaghetti-person, though, so take that estimation with a grain of salt. 

The end of this hike is a junction where it meets to other trailheads. If you're throughhiking then that's fine, I suppose, but since I was expecting a Big Thing at the end, it turned out to be something of an anti-climax after the vile, unrepentant, uphill deathmarch it took to get up there. 

So! There are two natural stopping points on this trail that are better than the listed one.

Option 1 is to do the first two miles, ending at the cute little waterfall. You can take some running water photos, catch your breath, and start back down.

Option 2 is set off past the waterfall, up the sudden and intense change in grade, muscle your way up through the tree cover, and emerge in the meadow. You can enjoy some wildflowers, take in the peaks around you, and then look down the grade on the way back and say, ""Jesus Christ, I *did* that?""

Past the meadow is an overgrown trail that, this time of year, was absolutely thick with flies and has a really disappointing terminus.

Leaving that aside, though, this was a great hike. Absolutely lousy with scenic grottos and glades, and with great views of the valley as you head higher. You can get a straight shot all the way out to the Great Salt Lake as you pass the birch forest.

It was tough, but hey, if I could do it with my linguini-like appendages, you probably can too. :D"
88,2017-07-09,['hiking'],"decent hike. high elevation change for the length and the lions share is in the last mile or so. flies out pretty thick as you climb, and there's not much payout for going past the meadow. really pretty though and good views down into the valley."
89,2017-06-29,['hiking'],I really enjoyed this hike. The flowers were blooming and it was really quiet. Unlike Bells Canyon and Corner Canyon we saw less than half a dozen hikers in the five and a half hours we spent on the trail. There were tons of blooming wild flowers and swarms of beautiful butterflies and dragon flies along the way. It's shaded most of the way up even though we got a late start at just after 11:00 am. The meadow is a little over half a mile from the end point on this hike. I wish I'd known that when we continued on that the end of the trail was at the junction for two trails and sort of anticlimactic. Maybe I was just tired. Either way I recommend enjoying the meadow before turning around to descend.
90,2017-06-25,['hiking'],Definitely worth working your way up to wildcat ridge.
91,2017-06-24,['hiking'],a bit too hot for me today but it saves the best views for the very end so I'm glad I finished it off to the meadow.
92,2017-06-21,['hiking'],really kicked my butt. It was 3 hours of straight up! but very rewarding. I'm happy I made it all the way to the meadow.
93,2017-06-16,['hiking'],There was a mountain lion spotted yesterday about a half mile from the meadow up top. Be cautious and keep a lookout!
94,2017-06-06,['hiking'],"3.9, beautiful and not too far away!"
95,2017-06-05,['hiking'],Steep snow patches on top.  To get a great view you have to go past the trail end to a nearby ridge.
96,2017-06-03,['hiking'],Heavy runoff right now. Trekking poles and waterproof shoes and/or extra socks recommended if you're trying to get to the meadow. Snow still present past the meadow.
97,2017-05-30,[''],This trail is easy to get lost on! I ended up with a few others scrambling boulders that led to snow.The trail is challenging and I recommend hiking shoes.
98,2017-05-12,['hiking'],Snow free until the meadows up top. Then it becomes a snow field. Beautiful views of two peaks from the meadows. Anyone know which peaks? Gobblers Knob and Raymond?
99,2017-05-11,['hiking'],"I'm wanting to Hike Neff's this weekend, do any of you know if there is snow or not?"
100,2017-05-06,[''],"For someone use to sea level hiking, it was a nice challenging elevation gain. Great shaded trail. Very little traffic early in the morning."
101,2017-05-04,['hiking'],"This place is amazing!! The trail is challenging enough you don't get bored, but not hard enough you can't enjoy it. Lots of shade, trees, boulders, streams, etc. More vegetation than most of the trails in Utah. Took my heeler mix and he was in heaven. Nice that he could be off leash and several other hikers with their dogs to occasionally play with. There was some snow towards the end. after about 3-4 miles in, the trail becomes overgrown and you can't go much farther. Definitely going back."
102,2017-03-26,[''],Good Hike. Lot of fun peaks to climb. The cave is cool if you can find it. Lots of deep snow in that area though
103,2017-03-25,[''],great trail if you go left and straight up there is a stream and a rope you can swing on
104,2017-03-24,['hiking'],"Was up there sledding two weekends ago with zipfy. Two days in a row, beautiful snow lots of families with little kids, However, there are too many loose dogs on the trail. The person I was sledding with got chased by a two different dogs off leash while heading down the trail. There should be marked signs or dogs need to be kept on a leash.The first dog nearly ran from its owner into the parking lot (someboday caught it before it lept over the cliff) and the second dog bit the person I was with through his park and all the owner did was ask the dog to apologize to my friend....luckily no puncture wound but a nasty bruise that is just  healing three weeks later. I love dogs too but signage and strict rules about having a leash on. The owners were lucky their dog did not bite a child -the scenario would have been not in their favor."
105,2017-03-14,['hiking'],"Pretty slick this time of year, so be careful. But it's absolutely gorgeous! Lots of diverse scenery: pines, snow, clearings and rocks, aspen groves, even a little stream from the spring runoff.

I don't think I agree with the ""hard"" rating. It's not too steep and the trails are clear throughout"
106,2016-12-28,['snowshoeing'],"It's a great workout, and the snowy tree cover is beautiful right now!"
107,2016-12-21,['hiking'],Great place to hike year round! This podcast sums it up pretty well: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/snowshoeing-snow-friendly/id1142336821?i=1000379208229&mt=2
108,2016-11-19,[''],There's better trails with better sites to see.
109,2016-11-16,[''],"To be honest I was not a big fan of this hike. The trail was difficult to follow and was super overgrown in places. There were a lot of little side trails so it was hard to ever really know if you were going the ""right"" way. I decided to turn back after getting turned around a few times because I didn't want to get too lost. I may have been a little more apt to keep at it if I hadn't been by myself."
110,2016-09-29,['hiking'],"We went in the winter, when there was a lot of snow on the ground...not a good idea. We couldn't get very far as it was too slippery."
111,2016-08-29,[''],"The steepest is legit.  but awesome hike, great foliage.  we were up in 2:20 and down in 1:20."
112,2016-08-06,['hiking'],"Trail is VERY overgrown. The map on here doesn't take you to an overlook, you have to keep going up a pretty steep face to get to where you can see anything, and even then it's not a clear view."
113,2016-07-24,[''],"It's more of a scramble than a hike, but still enjoyable and fun."
114,2016-07-18,['hiking'],"A super lush hike once you get about halfway to the top, but gets more overgrown the farther you go. I would definitely recommend pants!

Brought the dogs, and luckily the creek is still running once you get about 1.5 miles up the trail."
115,2016-07-10,[''],nice hike. I found at one time why this got its name... spent a few hours in the morning trying to locate the cave entrance. not sure why people think going into small holes is fun. any way hiked to the saddle then around to Millcreek and hitched a ride out to my car.  it was a good hike...
116,2016-07-06,['hiking'],Nothing great.
117,2016-07-03,[''],Great hiking options - many side trails to explore - love it even for short time hikes in the morning :)
118,2016-07-03,['hiking'],"The trail is fairly steep most of the way. Though fairly short in distance, it offers somewhat of a challenge. Take plenty of water. The meadow is approximately 2 miles from the trailhead.  I found it somewhat underwhelming."
119,2016-06-28,[''],My therapy. Great dog trail. I will be making this a weekly thing
120,2016-06-22,[''],"There are tons of options on this trail.  I've found at least 3 or 4, and a cave too."
121,2016-06-11,['hiking'],"Great hike for fur babies! Expect lots of dogs who love the hike along the stream. This time of year you will have to traverse through water so be prepared to get your feet wet. I would label it as strenuous due to the uphill climb and some loose rock the makes the descent a little tricky. It is a beautiful, shaded little canyon leading to a gorgeous meadow with a valley overlook. The deer flies were out when we went so be prepared. Our big Newfoundland companion loved the hike and the multiple opportunities to cool off in the stream. We did the hike to the meadow with multiple water stops for our fur companion and small break to enjoy the meadow in 3 hours."
122,2016-06-09,[''],lovely wooded trail.
123,2016-06-02,['trail running'],Amazing trail! Get there early to avoid traffic on the trail. This is a great trail to train on for obstacle course races. :) Happy running!
124,2016-05-30,['hiking'],"I enjoy this trail a lot. It is very shady and cool on the way up. There is a cave, rope swing, and a creek, which my dog loves to wade in and drink from. My only complaint is that it is usually quite crowded."
125,2016-05-19,[''],Fun but crowded
126,2016-05-18,['hiking'],"This is a heavily trafficked trail to the lower forested area featuring a very tall tree swing, babbling brook and Fort. Briefly diverging into two trails, meeting I at the main gravel trail. 
Continuing on you'll encounter a wooden bridge and open meadow. Beware of bees in the dense shrubs at the top."
127,2016-05-14,['hiking'],"Fantastic views, I am not able to hike often, 2 hrs fairly strenuous  but beautiful hike up with a brief detour to avoid a creek ( still got my feed wet twice), 1.5 hrs down. Lovely lunch place up in the meadow."

129,2016-04-21,[''],"I love this trial. There's a couple of routes you can take, so you never get bored, and the scenery is beautiful. It's bit steep on the way up, but there's tons to see, so you can take a breather and enjoy the view."
130,2016-04-18,['hiking'],"Great Hike, Brought my 2 1/2 year old daughter she bossed it near the top with me. very beautiful Hike very memorable."
131,2016-02-12,['hiking'],Don't waste your time
132,2015-09-19,['hiking'],"Great hike before or after work. Pretty intermediate. Nothing too strenuous. Takes about 3 hours, including some time spent in the meadow at the top. Easy trail to follow – basic orienteering helps – just stay to the left the entire way up. The solitude of the meadow is nice. Great views of Neff's Canyon and the Salt Lake Valley on the way down. I'll hike it again for sure."
133,2015-09-09,[''],Not that great
134,2015-07-26,['hiking'],"Constantly going up in elevation. If you aren't used to high elevation you'll need to take periodic breaks to get adjust. Lots of bugs, but the view at end from the meadow, even with all the bees and dragon flies, was well worth it. It will be easy if you hike a lot, but hard if you don't."
135,2015-07-11,[''],"Great! Real simple, but I've been going there for 20 years"
136,2015-06-18,['hiking'],"Lovely for early morning. There is currently a ""Road Closed"" sign at the turnoff to the parking lot, which everyone ignores, apparently."
137,2015-05-28,['cross country skiing'],Great hike for friends and fur babies!
138,2015-05-11,['hiking'],This is a beautiful but very steep hike. It is almost exactly 2.3 miles straight up to the meadow campsite. Trail was difficult to follow at times & you do get your feet wet but worth the effort. Not for the inexperienced hiker.
139,2015-04-30,['hiking'],Hiked about a month ago. Pretty easy hike. There was a decent amount of ice that caused some slipping and sliding. Nice short hike that leads up to a neat view.
140,2015-02-09,['hiking'],"Awesome hike. Great in the winter but micro-spikes are necessary. Got all the way up to the meadow with 61 degree weather (winter?). Saw about 6 people above the Mt. Olympus sign. Snow was still deep but was able to stay on the top. Coming down was awesome, sliding and slippery. Can't wait to bring someone with me to share the experience."
141,2014-11-06,['trail running'],"Neffs is a great hike. My friend and I decided to run it. The trail pitches up pretty quick and it becomes a run/hike. Overall it wasn't unlike anything else in the Wasatch, steep. The canyon obviously sees a good bit of use as there seems to be more than one trail most of the way up the drainage. Running down today offered the challenge of rotten snow to glissade down (on accident) to rear end contact with the trail. Overall a great run as well as hike. If you need a solid 1:05-1:30 run on steep and technical terrain this is a great option for trail. Trailhead is super easy to find and early in the fall mornings you're not sharing with a whole bunch of people yet."
142,2014-08-17,['hiking'],Semi-challenging hike devoid of water on this late summer day. Countless off trail possibilities creeping through the outcroppings :) Bring plenty of water and good sunglasses :)
143,2014-06-23,['hiking'],"Due to the descriptions below, I decided to share this from the Salt Lake Tribune, as I find it's the clearest (unless you're doing it in the snow like my boyfriend and I did earlier this year, not sure what trail we were on, but we made it to the meadow and to this day one of my favorite hikes every because of the snow) ....

This is a Wasatch classic, ending in a glorious, cliff-rimmed meadow overlooking the valley. The route is simple: Bear left up the drainage. The trailhead is on the east side of the parking lot. You will see two trails, but they rejoin within a few dozen yards, so either works. The trail bends southeast and then passes a large water tank after a quarter mile. At one-half mile, you will see a creek, and the trail jogs left. Ascend the steep drainage. At 1.5 miles, you will see a Mount Olympus Wilderness sign. At 1.75 miles is a stream crossing. Many hikers stop here, but the highlight is a meadow about 2.3 miles from the trailhead. Take in the soaring cliffs in all directions and follow the footpath to a junction a few yards to the north. Bear left and follow the path 0.1 mile to a makeshift campsite overlooking Millcreek and Olympus Cove.


Some of my personal stats:  Did this with a friend last weekend, took us 5 hours as she's asthmatic and a new hiker, but she absolutely nailed it with a great positive attitude.(5.47 miles, 4hrs50mins)  - Boyfriend and I did it in the snow at the end of April, (April 27th, 2014 - did it in 3hrs54min - 5.83 miles) - The meadow at the end is fantastic, and gorgeous in the snow.  I look forward to returning to do Neff's over to Thayne's."
144,2014-06-15,['hiking'],"It was a beautiful hike for a Sunday afternoon! I only saw a few other hikers, there was plenty of shade, and the trail followed a stream for part of the way, which my dog loved. My only issue with it was that there were a few forks in the trail and it was a hard to figure out which was the correct trail. I explored a few of the wrong options before finding the meadow, which was gorgeous! Jake Dennis's review (the one left just before this one) does a great job of explaining the right way. Definitely read it before you go!"
145,2014-05-31,['hiking'],"I took my Boy Scout troop up to the meadow to camp last night. As I was researching the trail it seemed very straight forward and easy to find. We came upon a major fork just after a water tower. We debated which way we should go and ultimately went to the right because the trail looked more groomed and we saw groups coming down and going up that way and none the other. After climbing to the top of a big cliff with no direct path we figured out we went the wrong way. This took a ton of time out of our hike and put us way behind schedule. When we made back down to the fork we met someone who had just come down and they explained how we get up. Because I could not find those directions anywhere I decided to write them. 

The start is straight forward. You will come upon a water tower on the left and soon after you find a pool of water (stream). You can go left or right. If you want to go to the meadow go left. May seem more straight than anything. This will be an easy to follow path. Occasionally you will find off shoots of the path but follow the better groomed paths. Some way up you will find a t in the road. Go left. Follow this for some time. It will begin to get steep but safe. Eventually you will find another fork in the road. If you go straight you would have to crawl over a log which does not seem very easy. The other option is a hard right. That is the correct way. You follow this trail for awhile and will have to cross the stream a time or two. Eventually you will have to walk up,the stream and your feet will get wet. You will do that a couple of times and once again reach a fork in the trail. To the right is a very steep incline and to the left you will have to cross the stream. It's similar to a small pool with a small waterfall on the right and one on the left. Cross that and you are close to the end. From it it is straight forward but the steepest part of the climb. 

As we took scouts and camped we had heavy packs on our backs. It was very hard but an 11 year old made it. Camping at the meadow is great. It's very secluded and quiet. The ground is a little slanted and very bumpy. 

Hope this serves someone well."
146,2014-05-18,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, much of it following a creek with heavier and more varied vegetation than many Utah hikes.  As you go up, it does get pretty steep.  Given running out of time and younger kids, we turned around about 2 miles up at a creek crossing."
147,2014-04-27,['hiking'],Perfect dog friendly trail.  There are many different trails to take. There is still snow towards the upper part.
148,2014-04-16,['hiking'],"I don't think it should be rated difficult- I am not in top shape and I can do it without a problem as well as my younger child. I see small kids- 6 and up on the trail. It's a nice place to take your dog and it is free. The first leg of the trail is a little boring b/c it is straight and just goes up to a flat area you can rest in and your dog can get a drink before you go up to the right or left. One year we went to the left toward Big Cottonwood ridge and some hikers warned us a black bear was about a 1/2 mile up. So we turned back because of our dog. This spring we were shocked to see no water. Usually the snow melt causes streams and there was only one trickle on the right trail that led up to a small pool. We thought the trail would be flooded as they usually are in spring. But it is very dry up there this spring because of little snowfall over winter. Overall, my family likes this hike a lot and we have gone frequently. The trail head parking area is a great area to watch the sunset over the Salt Lake Valley."
149,2013-10-27,['hiking'],"one of my favorite hikes, especially on hot days.  lots of shade.  great trail for dogs.  no leashes required.  dogs are free to roam.  my favorite side is the right fork.  great scenery and lookouts."
150,2013-08-21,['hiking'],"I went at the end of August and there were no bugs ... Beautiful hike, lots of shade"
151,2013-08-08,['hiking'],Great evening hike with lots of shade. Plenty of room for exploring and wildlife near trail in late September. Great work out hike with pleasant views of the valley. 
152,2013-08-04,['hiking'],"Hiked Neff's canyons this morning and climbed to both the passes that look down into two different canyons (see track). 1st looked down into Big Cottonwood Canyon (3,620 foot climb) and 2nd looked down into Thayne's canyon from the overlook (3,120 foot climb). The total distance was 8.62 miles. According the the hiking list on the Wasatch Mountain Clubs website the distance is 5.0 miles to the meadow. Neff's Canyon to Thaynes canyon pass 6.5 miles and Neffs Canyon to Pass 7.5 miles. So depending on where you destination is the 5.5 miles listed wouldn't get you there."
153,2013-07-05,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike, spent the morning hiking with the family. The bugs weren't too bad until you hold still . Very rocky terrain, nice shady hike for the most part if you take the trails on the right. "
154,2013-06-24,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike! Good distance, good elev. gain. Bring bug spray OR YOU WILL DIE! Many flies. The beginning sucks lots of people and off leash dogs. It gets pretty empty after a mile or so. "
155,2013-06-15,['hiking'],Unable to complete hike due to INSANE amount of flies the entire trail! 
156,2013-05-27,['hiking'],Beautiful view from the meadow and an excellent camping spot and fire pit overlooking the valley. Expect your feet to get wet during runoff season. This is a great alternative to paying $3 for Millcreek.
157,2013-05-26,['hiking'],"Hands down one of my favorite hikes ever. Jagged peaks, good elevation gain, and the most beautiful meadow bowl at the top. Never busy except in the first half mile where most locals walk their dogs. Venturing further requires fitness and some time. Fabulous views of city on the descent. Rushing creek marks much of the path. Highly recommended. Took about 2.5 hours to complete today."
158,2012-01-12,['hiking'],"Close to home and a nice alternative hike with my dogs when Millcreek is an on leash day. This starts out on an old road at the beginning, unless you start on the trail to the south side of the parking lot. Both tracks meet up about a half mile up the canyon. This trail continues up into the Mt. Olympus Wilderness. The lower trail gets heavy use most of the year with doggie outings, but the higher you go the fewer beings you will encounter. Relative solitude and natural beauty can be found in the upper reaches. This follows a seasonal creek that creates nice sounds of small falls when active. Nice getaway from the city, and is a challenging snowshoe or cross country ski in the winter.    "
