0,2019-09-05,"['hiking', 'rocky']","Hot & sunny. Great views of Mount Olympus, Kennecott copper mine, the Great Salt Lake, Salt Lake City, and Parleys."
1,2019-09-04,['hiking'],She’s short but boy is she a little bitch! Amazing view at the top I feel like I could see all the way to Idaho from up there!
2,2019-09-01,"['hiking', 'over grown']","We really enjoyed this trail, on my GPS from the parking lot to summit was 4mi, 1,800ft elevation gain. It is a steady steep climb, and the trail does narrow to overgrown bushes but all in all a great trail. Would recommend."
3,2019-09-01,['hiking'],"Great trail with a stunning view and open to dogs. However, it was a lot steeper than I thought so prepare for that "
4,2019-09-01,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. I didn't have much time so wanted something relatively short but with reasonable elevation gain - this was perfect! Took me about 2.5 hours total including time at the top enjoying the views and some stops for pictures along the way.
5,2019-08-24,['hiking'],"I agree with others - I was worried about the steep grade of this hike. However, it didn’t feel that bad and it seemed to be longer (so less elevation gain per mile). I went at a steady pace with plenty of water breaks and did well. I had a small breakfast and snack at the top, which was fine. Great for pups! Would recommend longer pants, as the path is thick with brush (though clearly visible). I was more comfortable that way. Didn’t use hiking poles, though I suppose you could. May be difficult to maneuver at times given the brush on the sides of the trail. Shade on and off until you get closer to the top. You’ll reach a big fork at one point. Go right and follow the map."
6,2019-08-19,[''],"Still some wildflowers on the trail. It took me around 2 hours top to bottom. I would guess it’s more like 4 miles instead of 3. A good, steep, hike"
7,2019-08-18,['hiking'],"I was nervous about how steep this is per the stats, but I think the trail is maybe just a tad longer than advertised, so it's closer to the 1000ft/mile grade. If you can do Mount Wire on one of the trailheads coming up from the Bonneville Shoreline Trail, you can do this. The trail actually gets easier from the saddle, because the switchbacks don't have any crazy steep parts. An early start means some peaceful solitude on the expansive peak, with nice cool breezes. "
8,2019-08-15,['hiking'],"Super steep the entire way.  I was happy to call it good when I reached saddle, not knowing if that was the end or not. Apparently it wasn’t!  Still spectacular views from the saddle."
9,2019-08-12,"['hiking', 'over grown']",
10,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'over grown']","Steeper than I was expecting. Somewhat overgrown and very little shade at the switchbacks above the saddle.

That said, it’s a nice view from the top. Decent short hike if you’re in the area."
11,2019-08-11,"['hiking', 'over grown']",Little overgrown. Wish I wore pants instead of shorts but the scratches on my legs were worth it for the views. My dog and I had a wonderful time. 
12,2019-08-05,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'over grown', 'rocky']",
13,2019-08-03,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'over grown', 'rocky']",Hiked this in the late afternoon August 2. Elevation gain was a little under 1900’ in under 2 miles.  It’s a pretty good bit of climbing the entire time. I completed it in around 1hr 45min.  Great hike to do on a whim or the late afternoon in the summer. Took about a little over an hour to reach the top at an ok pace.  Very little exposure with forest most of the way!  Sunscreen not really required.  Some slippery parts on the way down.  Bring good soles. A little over grown but I didn’t get any ticks on me. 
14,2019-07-29,['hiking'],"Hiked this with my 10 year old 22 pound terrier, today. We got a late start so left around 11:30 from the trailhead and arrived back at the car by 3:30.  It was very shaded in the beginning and sufficiently throughout such that the Sun wasn't terrible at mid day. Temperatures in The Valley were up to a 100 but not on mount aire :). The meadows and patches of forest are numerous and wonderous. It's like hiking through a series of frames, one scene at a time, the changing flora and fauna was delightful. The trail followed a small Creek, and up to about 2/3 of the way up the mountain it was still flowing, but then abruptly stopped, much to my dog's dismay.  The ascent is rather steep for long stretches so be respectful of that ""difficult"" rating. The trail went dry and rocky after the  Ridge below the peak (mount aire is to your right when you're cresting the ridge where you can finally see into the salt lake valley). Also the trail is quite narrow in many sections. Recommend hiking shoes/padding for your dogs as my Goldie Was a little worse for wear after that section and up to the peak.  Rewarding views all the way to the top and around/ along the upper ridge.  (I mean, it's not really a peak if more a high point on a high ridge). 3 bucks at the canyon gate on the way out seems a pittance to pay  ;). Would do again,  100%."
15,2019-07-27,['hiking'],"Gorgeous wildflowers! Amazing views into Lamb’s canyon, Parley’s, and Salt Lake Valley. "
16,2019-07-25,['hiking'],"Difficult, but view from top is worth it. hard switch hacks at the very end. "
17,2019-07-22,['hiking'],My new favorite trail! It’s uphill the whole way so it’s definitely a challenge. Super green and lush with a mix of shade and sunny parts. The wildflowers are gorgeous and make for some very picturesque scenery. The view is incredible at the end! Highly recommend.
18,2019-07-20,['hiking'],"I loved this hike. Good workout & beautiful views. Trail has beautiful wildflowers almost the whole way, lots of shade as well. Was not crowded at all. Didn’t see people until I was at the top & they were coming down. Saw a total of maybe 15 people the whole hike. Started at 7:20 am & reached the top at 8:30. Left the summit at 8:45 & got down about 9:20. "
19,2019-07-19,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike!  Lots of different types of wildflowers blooming the entire way.  There’s a lot of elevation gain and this is a shorter hike, meaning it is Steep.  We took our time, stopping to take photos and enjoy the view from the top, and it took 2 1/2 hours round trip.  We saw a huge rattlesnake, but it had already crossed the path and was heading up into the trees.  This is an excellent hike!"
20,2019-07-18,"['hiking', 'scramble']","We headed up the trail at 6am with some long sleeve, light jackets on, hiking up and up, mostly in shade. At around 7am we were ready to take the jackets off!
Amazing views at the top, Parleys Canyon, Dell Reservoir, Emigration Canyon, SL Valley, Kennecott Copper Mine, Great Salt Lake, many peaks and everything in between.
2+ miles up, 2,000ft elevation.
Great intermediate hike, take lots of water, bear spray, sturdy shoes, hat and plan on 3 hours minimum.
Parking and pit toilet at the trailhead."
21,2019-07-14,['hiking'],great steep trail with solid views the last mile after some wildflowers and Creek hiking to start
22,2019-07-13,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'muddy']",Fantastic climb to the peak with spectacular views the entire last 3rd. There is a progressive pallet of wildflowers popping the entire trail. Some patches of mud but nothing to contend with. Tracked 4.3 miles RT. Great workout! 
23,2019-07-09,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Hiked this trail today. Lots of beautiful wildflowers and it was pretty shady throughout which was awesome. Steep but short. Got there at about 11am and finished by 1pm with a stop at the top to enjoy the views. Kinda muddy so I'm glad I brought a towel to put over the back seat of my car for my dog.  Overall great hike. 
24,2019-07-09,"['hiking', 'bugs', 'rocky']",Great trail for a good workout. Steep and a leg burner for sure but not too long. Took about 45 min on the way down and about 1 hr 15 min up. Great views along the way and good amount of wildflowers. 
25,2019-07-05,['hiking'],Short but steep. Great views.
26,2019-07-04,"['hiking', 'bugs']",
27,2019-07-01,"['hiking', 'bugs']",Fun hike. Steep in some parts but not too long. Hiked it with my pooch on the first day the gate opened. Decently buggy at the top so use some bug spray.
28,2019-06-12,['hiking'],"A good workout. Mill creek gate is still closed, so count on either hiking the Pipeline trail to the Mt. Aire TH or just walking up the road—which is what I did. Started at 9:00 am on the 6/10, was back at the car by noon. Definitely muddy, so count on getting dirty, but follows water most of the way, and if pretty shaded until you get to the saddle. From the saddle on, things were pretty toasty. Views are pretty good, but the noise from I-80 is a bit annoying. "
29,2019-05-14,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","Road closed until July (per sign), so as others have said, expect to walk 1.5 miles past the gate on the road before you get to the trailhead. The first half or more of the trail winds through forest and steady incline. The trail is washed out and muddy with a little creek as the snow is still melting, but only a few small patches of snow on the entire trail right now. Near the top the views are really nice. Lots of horned toads out scurrying around, so watch your step. Had a snack on the summit before a storm from the west chased me down. Great hike if you want to do it all in a few hours. "
30,2019-05-05,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'snow']","The trail is in pretty rough condition to the saddle. Be prepared for snow, mud, and running water. Once to the saddle you will find the trail dry and easy until you hit a small patch of leftover peak snowpack."
31,2019-01-07,['hiking'],"Trail is in great shape for wintertime.   Well packed snow until the saddle, then post hole steps for a bit.  Once on the mountain ( after the big right turn at top of saddle ), it is back to packed trail.   Last bit of the summit is a bit sketchy.  Once on that East side, the trail normally switches back to the West, then one last switch back to the Summit, however it is just kicked in steps on the East side.  Be very careful to not slip and fall, as could be dangerous.   View are great, and didn't see a soul add day on the trail.  Road was crowded coming back down."
32,2019-01-03,['hiking'],"Winter gate is closed, so it ads 1.5 miles to the start of the trail. Trail is well packed until the saddle (at about a mile in from the trailhead), only needing yak-tracks. A short segment of the saddle is not well packed- maybe from the wind blown snow. Once you make it around the corner to the right the trail up Mt Arie is again well packed except for the very final stretch to the top. The hike is quite steep from the trailhead to the saddle and still climbs afterwards, but not as tough. Amazing view all around!!!"
33,2018-12-23,['hiking'],"AWESOME VIEWS! 

I swear I wrote a review for this a while back .... 

Anyways .... I Did this one back in July! 

It was awesome! 

Would like to do it again in the winter w/ the dogs. :-)"
34,2018-12-16,[''],"Gate is closed, so add another 3 miles to this hike. Beautiful views!"
35,2018-10-27,['hiking'],Good hardy hike. The views are great even from the saddle before the final push for the summit. Great sunset.
36,2018-10-25,[''],"Winter gate is already up for the season. If you want to do this one from the starting point shown, you'll need to road walk 1.5 miles to get to the trailhead after parking at the picnic area in front of the Winter gate. Or you could connect to it via another trail that begins prior to the gate."
37,2018-10-14,[''],"Wish I'd brought gloves and spikes cause it was damn cold after the saddle and slippery on the way down.  Beautiful hike though, will do again."
38,2018-10-07,['hiking'],"I did this hike on the morning of one of the first dustings of the year. The snow level was about 7500 feet. As many have stated, it is fairly steep but I didn’t find it that strenuous and it wasn’t technical. You accumulate almost 2000 feet of elevation gain in less than 2 miles. I reached the top in about a hour. There was limited visibility when I reached the summit and there wasn’t any cairns marking the summit  so i wasn’t sure I reached the summit but the AllTrails app marked my spot at the summit. As far as summits go, this one is very accessible and achievable in under 2 hours. Great hike to do with your dog because it doesn’t require any scrambling."
39,2018-09-27,['hiking'],Very steep but the view is definitely worth it! Took me about an hour and a half total.
40,2018-09-17,[''],"great views but tough. this hike will let you know what your fitness level is, for sure. I'm no speed hiker and it took me about 3 hours to complete."
41,2018-09-10,[''],Spectacular views! This was a fantastic hike for me and my pup. Definitely worth the incline to see all the mountain tops and the sites below. Recommended!
42,2018-08-23,[''],Now this is a hike. A burner so to speak. Very steep in some places. Great view when you reach the top.
43,2018-08-20,['hiking'],This is a ball buster or a hike but beautiful and a fantastic workout.
44,2018-08-11,['hiking'],"We went on a really smoky day and missed a lot of the views. The trail is pretty steep the whole way up, but not brutal. The views from the peak are awesome! Totally cool hike."
45,2018-07-20,['hiking'],"Even though the valley is hot, this trail is very shaded and cool all the way to the saddle.  The switch-backs up to the ""summit"" are more exposed.  Be aware of rattlesnakes.. saw only one rattling away at us (consider keeping dogs on leash).  The view isn't my favorite, but it does provide a beautiful view of Parleys Canyon.  Happy Hiking!  

(4 miles round trip)"
46,2018-07-16,[''],Took me 1.25 up and 45 minutes down. Beautiful views of Millcreek canyon and parleys. Definitely steep the entire way up but a quick and good hike.
47,2018-07-14,['hiking'],"Not sure why this is listed a moderate. I found it to be a nice short and easy hike. It was a cloudy muggy day and we had some sprinkles. At the cairn in the saddle, we took the trail to the south for another view. It was much steeper, but very short and worth the extra 20 minutes."
48,2018-07-04,[''],"Beautiful wildflowers everywhere, and plenty of shade as long as you get an early start."
49,2018-07-02,[''],Sharp right turn as soon as you reach the saddle that allows for views of the Great Salt Lake.
50,2018-06-25,[''],Hiked in February.
51,2018-06-11,['hiking'],Beautiful views for the second half of the hike all the way to the top! It’s a steep incline all the way up but well worth it. The wildflowers were blooming today and the trail was clear and dry.
52,2018-05-21,[''],"This was absolutely gorgeous, wildflowers blooming, and clear, dry trail all the way up."
53,2018-05-20,['hiking'],"No snow, no people on the trail, and great views.  Love having a trail all to myself this time of year."
54,2018-05-19,[''],Hiked this yesterday.  Everything is so green and the wildflowers are out!  We didn’t run into any snow and we didn’t see anyone else on the trail.  Amazing views!  We went to the peak and it is worth the extra effort past the viewpoint.  The gate is still closed to drive up to the trailhead so it adds on about 1.3 miles just to get there but so worth it to not have crowds!
55,2018-05-02,['hiking'],We hiked from 3 miles down to Aire trail head on the pipeline trail.  Once you get in shade there are patches of snow that mixed with mud has made the hike up a bit hard. We made it to the flat spot between peaks. The last bit is terrible! I would just stay on the pipeline trail for a few more weeks.
56,2018-04-29,[''],"Trial is dry and very little snow left.  only 8 foot piece above the last bridge.  Still a little muddy near the saddle.   Summit was great views.   Remember you need to walk the 1.5 miles up to the trailhead, so round trip is about 7 miles total."
57,2017-11-26,[''],"Great hike! Amazing view, you can see right into the salt lake valley. Is pretty steep, but not that long. I tracked a little over 3 miles from the trailhead round trip. Some parts are a little wet, but mostly still dry."
58,2017-11-06,['hiking'],So beautiful!! Really muddy today and the road is closed which adds an extra 3 miles (RT)  to the hike but worth it.
59,2017-10-22,[''],"Hiked 10-21-17. The gate to the trailhead is closed for the season so you have to walk 1.5ish miles on the road before reaching trail, adding an additional 3 miles roundtrip. The trail is completely clear of ice and snow, making it a nice later season summit. But since everything is dried up and the leaves are fallen, I imagine it's much more scenic in the Summer or very early Fall."
60,2017-10-22,[''],The trail was muddy in spots.  Nice views all the way up.  Not a technical trail but steep.
61,2017-10-12,[''],Very short but very steep. Definitely hard rated.
62,2017-09-30,[''],Really pretty! Great views. A little tough 
63,2017-09-25,['hiking'],"Absolutely beautiful up there today. Pretty warm with direct sunlight. Hike took about 1 hr and 15 mins up, roughly 50 down. Very muddy at parts and certainly slippery; would be beneficial to have trekking pools and/or gaiters. Absolutely worth it! No real color changes yet - some faint color sporadically but it definitely isn't peaking for a few days, at least."
64,2017-09-08,['hiking'],Wow that was tough but a great workout!!!
65,2017-08-17,[''],I always forget how tough it is. With that being said it's a good short power hike!
66,2017-08-14,[''],"Short and sweet!! It was a challenge but we were up and down in a couple hours, sweaty and happy!"
67,2017-08-05,[''],Great hike. Loved the shade/sun mix. Gorgeous views.
68,2017-07-26,['hiking'],"Hiked it on Pioneer day. I thought I was getting on the Pipeline trail, but actuially was on this one. It was extremely steep. Total gained elevation is  approximate 1987 ft . I was super glad I didnt quit and go back down there... the views were worth every bit of pain"
69,2017-07-24,[''],Hiked it in the early morning. Super steep but plenty of shade. The wildflowers were in full bloom. Absolutely gorgeous hike!
70,2017-07-24,[''],"quick and pretty, though rather direct at times"
71,2017-07-13,['hiking'],"It took longer than anticipated, about 3 hrs round trip with two dogs. It's gorgeous but hard!"
72,2017-07-07,['hiking'],I sunrise hiked this and it was steep and tough and a lot of the trail wasn't covered so it was hot on the way down. Great view of Parleys and the valley though.
73,2017-07-04,['hiking'],"Steepness is moderate but worth noting. It's too hot to do mid-day now....that was my bad. My four year old son walked up this mountain. So....it's doable by most, but it's pretty difficult for an ""easy"" summit. Features a sunflower field that is just breathtaking."
74,2017-06-21,[''],"Steep, shaded, challenging, beautiful. Hiked at sunset last night. At the top you can see the Uintahs, Mt Olympus, Kennecott, Antelope Island. Did see on rattlesnake. Keep an eye out."
75,2017-06-17,['hiking'],"This was an awesome hike. The gate is closed to cars until July 1st, so know that you need to walk a couple miles up the road to get to the trailhead, but it's a stunning hike the whole way up. Definitely not for the faint hearted. It's absolutely not easy, but doable if you're in at least decent shape! I definitely recommend this hike!"
76,2017-05-18,['hiking'],Late season snow today.  Pretty
77,2017-05-11,['hiking'],Started road closed sign.  A bit muddy up top but safe.  Perfect day.
78,2017-05-01,['hiking'],"Reached summit with my son today.   1.5 mile hike from parking to the trailhead.   Trail is steep and muddy for the first 1/2.  Snow and watery trails to the summit.  Plan on getting very wet, muddy and tired this time of year."
79,2017-04-23,['hiking'],"Attempted with family this weekend.  Took the pipeline trail to this trail head ( 3 miles ) and this trail was good for about 3/4 of a mile.  Then ice and snow covered the trail.   Ended up turning back, and will wait till the snow melts a bit more.  Took road back to the car, and that has ice/snow for about 1/4 mile of the 1.5 miles to the parking."
80,2017-04-15,[''],FYI 1.5 miles before you reach the trail head there is a gate that doesn't open until July 1. Rode was still completely covered in packed icy snow about 1/4 mile up from the gate. I was looking to move more quickly last night so I decided to wait and do this hike later in the season. The trail it self might not be snowy. Unsure. Also there was a sign saying a cougar was seen along the road just the day before.
81,2017-04-02,['hiking'],Great Hike. Was pretty muddy though from the melt. Still fun and some awesome views
82,2017-03-17,['hiking'],"Beautiful hike. Easy to do, was up and back in 4 hours due to a ton of snow. But well worth it once you're at the top"
83,2017-03-17,[''],"Beautiful, steep hike. Fairly hard but well worth the views."
84,2017-02-21,[''],a nice good hike and it's got a great view of Parleys canyon
85,2016-11-12,['hiking'],"This hike was definitely difficult for me as it has a steep incline (and I had a few too many beers the night before). However, it was beautiful at the top, great view!"
86,2016-11-02,['hiking'],
87,2016-11-01,['backpacking'],"10.31.16 | 15lb Backpack | 4-6:30pm Round-trip

A beautiful Halloween hike with my GSD before the upper portion of the canyon closes Nov. 1st. This is definitely steep but we enjoyed the variety of crossing bridges, climbing over fallen trees and the changing views. It was a cool 40-50 degrees but you warm up quickly as it's steep (and the heavy pack had me sweating). It was muddy and slippery due to melted snow so grippy shoes are helpful this time of year.

I wouldn't say it's the most spectacular views but a nice change of pace to the typical West facing views overlooking Salt Lake Valley. We'll do it again!"
88,2016-10-24,['hiking'],
89,2016-10-14,['hiking'],"Beautiful this time of year!! It gets pretty steep in places but the view at the top is worth it! We took our pup and he loved it. Lots of water stops on the way up for him!
Great trail for running if you go during the week. Not crowded and no bikes!"
90,2016-10-10,['hiking'],"Took the family out yesterday for a short hike. Didn't get too far but the views were nice. The trail was very busy, especially with dogs. There was so much dog poop all over the trail it was disgusting. Lots of poop bags were just left on the trail that just needed to be put in the trash. I don't think we will be going up here anymore, it's literally a dogs toilet. Seems like the norm up this canyon too. We checked out other trails with the same problem, dog poop and poop bags all over. I wish dog owners would be more respectful of our trails and of others."
91,2016-09-13,[''],"So. Steep. However, the views are extremely worth it. Before the switchbacks to the peak, the saddle is an amazing place to catch your breath and take it all in."
92,2016-09-11,['hiking'],This is one of my favorite hikes in Millcreek canyon. It's a must do in the Fall because there are whole hillsides of Quaking Aspen trees that will blow your mind when they are all yellow. It's a steep hike but the view at the top is spectacular. Make sure you're in shape!
93,2016-09-05,['hiking'],"Very nice, but quite steep trail up to a summit with pretty views all around.  This trail definitely makes a mile and a half feel longer.  The first segment before the saddle is a really lovely shaded hike through the woods, up above you get into the more typical scrub oak terrain."
94,2016-08-28,['hiking'],"Pretty steep! Views are excellent. We went early-ish (started at 7AM) and found the trail to be cool and shaded the entire way. Took us an hour and 45 mins to the top, but we're very slow hikers. On our way down, we ran into two bears on the trail. No joke. Be careful!"
95,2016-08-17,['hiking'],Way steeper than you would expect. It's a decent hike.
96,2016-08-07,[''],"Steeper than expected, but very pretty!"
97,2016-07-26,['hiking'],Another great after work hike. It is exposed and a climb. This was a late July hike. The trail is well marked. The views at the summit are spectacular. It took us about a little over hour to get to the top at a moderate pace and some stops to enjoy the views.
98,2016-07-17,['hiking'],"Short, Dry, hot, and steep, a lot of the wildflowers are drying up now.... Great calf work out though and lovely views from top :)"
99,2016-07-14,['hiking'],Steep- short and sweet. Beautiful wild flowers and views.
100,2016-07-04,[''],"Gorgeous trail, beautiful wildflowers right now, tons of bugs though so bring bug spray!"
101,2016-06-19,['hiking'],"Since the road is still closed, we hiked 3 miles along pipeline from the next closest entry point, and back along down millcreek canyon road, making it a 9 mile loop. So just keep distance in mind before the gate opens. Great, challenging hike. There's a stream along the bottom portion, which was great for my dog. Shaded for a large chunk too. I also didn't know which way to go at the saddle, so turn right! :) The switchbacks to the summit are pretty exposed, and the flies were terrible! It's so green and beautiful right now, tons of flowers and incredible views from the saddle and on the way to the summit. Highly recommended!"
102,2016-06-09,[''],"This trail is steep! Having never been, wasn't sure which direction to head once I got to the saddle so take a good look at the map before you head out. Want do it again and go all the way to the top. [The view even just at the saddle isn't bad:) ]"
103,2016-06-06,[''],Rough and tough.  Steep but so very worth it.
104,2016-05-29,['hiking'],"Good tree cover until the saddle, then it gets pretty exposed; wear sunscreen."
105,2016-04-17,['hiking'],"Road to trailhead closed until July 1.  Snow on 1.5 mile walk to trailhead.  Trail is well marked, though the amount of snow on the trail makes for slow going.  Would rec hiking with packed snow or the snow is thawed.  Trail runs parallel to a creek, which is enjoyable to watch the water flow."
106,2015-10-28,['hiking'],"Missed the majority of the fall colors :( should have been a few weeks earlier. Steep trail the whole way up no real place were you get to relax on the hike its just up the whole way. Very shaded while in the drainage. Less shade once you make it to the saddle its the first time you really start to get a feel of how far you've come from the trail head. Once at the top there are some great views you can see mountain peaks in every direction, you can even see antelope island. The way down was a quad burner. Really wish I would have brought trekking poles with me to help with the grade. Overall a good hike especially if you really want a work out. I would like it more if there was at least some areas to have a more relaxing hike."
107,2015-10-26,['hiking'],Gorgeous view from the top.  Fairly steep gradient all the way up but the trail is very well laid out.  Took 2 hours to go up with lots of stops for pictures and 45 minutes to come down.
108,2015-10-17,['hiking'],"Did this trail October 16th. Did an evening hike and it was beautiful! Took me an hour and 15 minutes to get up, it's pretty steep all the way. So. Many. Switchbacks. But it's totally worth doing. Just make sure you give yourself plenty of time. Got back just before it got really dark. The sunset from the top was beautiful!"
109,2015-10-08,['hiking'],"Easy trail in mill creek. Worth the walk-it took my group 45 minutes to summit, just in time for a great sunset!"
110,2015-08-30,['hiking'],"I quite liked this trail! Compared to other Millcreek Canyon peaks, it was my favorite. The hike was steep but very enjoyable. It starts off along a wooded trail and opens up once you emerge on the ridge. I climbed the small peak just west of Mount  Aire along the way. The peak itself is pretty with trees, red rock, and spectacular views. I would recommend bringing more water than you expect. I went on a warm day and due to the steep elevation increase and heat drank far more than I normally do on a hike of this distance at this time of year."
111,2015-08-08,['hiking'],"Very nice views.  A good moderate hike, well worth it."
112,2015-07-30,['hiking'],"This hike is fairly steep but shouldn't really take more than 1.5-2 hours max, round trip, if you keep up a good pace. I reached the top and met a guy who ran up it in 30 mins! Pretty views and shaded more than half the way. Trail goes through the trees most of the way, I started at about 6:00PM which was perfect."
113,2015-07-16,[''],"It's is a great hike on a hot summer night.  It is shaded until the peak with tons of wildflowers and aspens along the way.  The view from the top is gorgeous.  It is a bit steep, but not bad.  I will definitely go again."
114,2015-07-04,[''],"Loved the trail, but it is steep! Hiked at 10am with shade all the way to the top. Wildflowers were amazing and the view at the top was worth the pain."
115,2015-06-20,['hiking'],"Great hike. If you want to hike this trail prior to July 1st you have to either walk up the road 3 miles or take the pipeline trail because of a gate at Maple Grove that closed the road for winter. The trail climbs steeply the entire way. The summit is really a long ridge and have view of parts of Salt Lake city, Parley's canyon, Lambs canyon and of course Mill Creek Canyon where the trail starts The trail was dry and free of muddy areas today. 6/20/15"
116,2015-05-28,['trail running'],"Steep and moist! Tons of shade! Short and semi-sweet, due to some scrambled sections. Not open year round, the upper section of millcreek canyon is closed for winter months."
117,2015-05-19,['hiking'],"Hiked it coming from Lamb's Canyon.  Lots of shade and water leading up to the pass.  Was expecting more of a trail from the pass to summit but ended up following moose and deer trails and bushwacking for most of the way.  Other than that it was a beautiful hike and very solitary, seeing only 2 people in Lamb's Canyon and none on the way to the summit."
118,2014-08-25,[''],"Good hike. Very steep, not many switchbacks. Worth it at the top of the hike to see the summit. Perfect day to go...no bugs and didn't see too many people on the trail."
119,2014-08-10,[''],"Love this trail!!! Super easy to do by yourself - the trail is well marked and very straightforward. Definitely steep the whole climb, impressed with myself for doing it in 2.5 hours when it varies from 2.5-4 hours.  The first mile (very true to one mile) is lush and riparian.  The second mile from the saddle is very west facing exposed.   Wear sunscreen and bring a hat!! In short: the trail is comprised of take a left, take a right, summit."
120,2014-07-29,[''],"This trail has it's good and bad elements.  On a hot summer day, the shade is a welcome feature, however the trade off is a lack of any kind of view until the peak is reached. It's unnecessarily steep in my opinion (plenty of room for a better trail design)  and it suffers when wet & muddy.  As for the peak, those expecting an alpine experience like many of the other Wasatch peaks, don't get your hopes up.  Mt. Aire is a tall foothill predominantly covered by scrub oak. 

The Pros: Shade, fall colors, accessible, good workout.
The Cons: A bit too steep, lack of view, trail is horrific when wet, less crowded than Grandeur."
121,2014-07-07,['hiking'],"I just did the Mt. Aire Trail to the summit, then went down the Lamb Canyon Trail.  It ended up being about 4 miles in all and I preferred the Mt. Aire trail to the Lamb Canyon, primarily because of the numerous horse (deer?) flies on the Lamb Canyon side.  There were streams on both sides of the summit and the understory was very thick with great canopy cover.  The views from the summit included really pretty flower studded valleys.  We found moose scat, tracks and bed areas at the top which were pretty fresh - you could still smell the musky odor!  We had meant to check out Lake Salamander but were woefully unprepared and ended up down in Lamb Canyon valley.  Some lovely people we ran into on the trail gave up a ride to Mill Creek Canyon - thanks to those people with the super cute baby that liked trucks!  It was a great hike and I was so happy to see trees."
122,2014-06-19,['hiking'],"Nice little hike. Short and Steep so you really get those legs worked.  Dog friendly canyon so that is a plus (be careful about letting your pup off leash, ours ran into some snakes just off the trail but luckily we had him on leash).  Gate doesn't open until 07/01 so you'll have to walk from the parking lot to the trail head until then (about 1.5-2 mi on paved road each way)"
123,2013-08-20,['hiking'],"I have summited this mountain twice now and love it to pieces.   Awesome shade, views, wild flowers, etc.  It is a rather short trail, but there are some nasty switchbacks, so be prepared."
124,2013-08-08,['hiking'],"Loved this hike! Completed in late September after work one evening. I was able to summit, rest and enjoy fall colors, and get back down in less than three hours. The trail was very quite with only a couple of other hikers out in the evening and only a few dogs. The first half of the hike is shady and quite pleasant, and the run to the summit is through scraggly brush switchbacks. Really enjoyed the cool weather and beautiful colors in September!"
125,2013-07-21,['hiking'],"Nice trail that opens up after July 1 each year. About 4 miles and 2000 feet of elevation gain. All kinds of wildflowers and fantastic sweeping views. Do this hike in the morning, however, as there is very little shade."
126,2012-09-16,['hiking'],Map directed me to a private road. Don't trespass!
127,2011-07-09,['hiking'],"Steep but short trail to the top of Mt Aire, well shaded for the first 2/3 of the trail in the morning. Lots of bugs appeared as the day warmed up. Great views of Parleys & Lambs canyons from the top. Didn't see any bikes on the trail but lots of dogs."
