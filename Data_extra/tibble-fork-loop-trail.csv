The first mile is muddy and washed out but after that the trail is in good condition. Stick to the AllTrails map, otherwise you might accidentally add an extra mile like us."
1,2019-08-28,['hiking'],"Such a gorgeous trail that offers a variety of meadows, forests, views and small lakes. Unfortunately, there are motorcycle's that race through on these trails and it can be dangerous if you have a dog. Also, my buddy and I were prone to injuries on this hike despite it being moderate and us being experienced. Bee stings and scratches."
2,2019-08-11,['hiking'],This is my first time hiking a trail shared with dirt bikes and I hope to avoid this experience going forward. Had a single track aspect to a lot of it with loud dirt bikers buzzing through. It was pretty but not peaceful.
3,2019-08-02,"['hiking', 'muddy']",Good hike but definitely longer than the posted 4.7.  I logged 6.75 on my Apple Watch. We did the whole loop plus the walk from the bigger parking lot by the reservoir.  We followed the map marked on the app but half of it was either mud Spring trail or Mill Canyon so maybe that’s why it was longer. Just followed the red line.  Trail was muddy in places and as others have said. Some motorcycle riders but not many.

5,2019-07-08,['hiking'],"Love this hike. Easy to get to for a couple of hours of hiking in beautiful AF canyon.  I prefer starting on the south side of the loop (near the dam) because the ascent isn’t so steep. An hour or so into the hike is a nice alpine meadow.

I agree that it seems to be taken over by motorcycles, which are destroying a once peaceful trail, especially on the mill canyon trail. To avoid the motorcycles hike the south side of the loop, enjoy the meadow, and then return down the same trail. "
6,2019-07-07,['hiking'],In great condition now.  A beautiful hike - especially with everything still so green!

8,2019-06-22,"['hiking', 'muddy', 'rocky']","This is a great hike for all types of hikers. Did it twice within a week with two different groups of people and everyone enjoyed it. There is a bit of elevation at the beginning but it’s not hard. The views of the meadows at the back of the loop are dreamy and totally worth it. Easy hike that’s not too crowded, although there are lots of dirt bikers which gets annoying and scary when they ride like idiots and don’t exercise courtesy to hikers."
9,2019-06-03,"['hiking', 'muddy']",We did this backward since our map didn’t load right away. This is a great short hike. Runoff created a lot of water crossings. As we reached the end we decided to cross next to the lake. This was somewhat of a mistake. It was muddy and slick in most places. Really have to watch your step otherwise you’ll slide down straight into the water. This wouldn’t be a problem when dry. We did this with 2 little dogs and an 11 and 14 yo. We will be back to do it again as this is a beautiful little trail.
10,2019-05-31,['hiking'],Most of the views are from the reservoir but it’s a nice trail. We took a shortcut as we didn’t have quite enough time to complete the actual loop. There was a lot of snow runoff over the trail in a few places but it was do-able.
11,2019-05-14,"['muddy', 'off trail']","Went up May 13th, 2019. The path was really mud and snowy. it was hard to find the path because it wasn't clearly marked. once we got to the dead end that was part of Timponookee we decided to turn back so we don't get lost."

14,2019-02-09,"['snowshoeing', 'snow']",
15,2019-01-05,['hiking'],The trail was traveled enough and the snow was so packed that we never used our snowshoes. Hiked a little past the Mud Springs Trail junction. Started just as it was getting light and watch the sunrise lite up the mountains behind us. The morning light made the mountains look incredable
16,2018-08-20,['hiking'],The trail on the back side of Tibble Fork is no longer a nice hike. The old trail is gone or only partly there.
17,2018-07-24,['hiking'],"This trail has been taken over by motorcycles and, particularly on the backside, is terribly worn down.  It is not a peaceful hike as it is a very constant, steep descent punctuated by motorcycle traffic. 

If you start from the dam and hike to the top, it is more peaceful though we were passed by a group of 3 motorcycles. It was a steady ascent but not uncomfortable uncomfortable."
18,2018-06-29,['hiking'],"Very Busy Trail, lots of dirt  bikes, trail needs to be maintained but it is difficult to do so because the type of dirt. Some parts of the trail are missing, easy to get lost or loose track of the trail. Nice views of the lake"
19,2018-06-19,['hiking'],I had the hills to myself. I can see some trail work has been done. A good uphill climb to a gorgeous open meadow. Then a good drop down into the steams feeding into the reservoir.
20,2018-06-16,['hiking'],"Hike in early. You'll beat the crowds and only have to share the trail with a few cyclists and dirt bikers. 

Beautiful meadow about 1.5 miles up from the counter clockwise route on the west side. I recommend starting there too. Take a book and some snacks if you have some time to spare in the meadow, especially if you go early... so peaceful and beautiful. Loved this hike, even with all the bikers."
21,2018-06-04,['hiking'],"HEADS UP....this map is the old trail! We kept getting lost and there were so many break offs on the trail with no signs directing which trail was Tibble Fork. 
We talked to a ranger and he helped direct us and let us know the map was wrong. They re did the trail last year and have not put signs up yet for it (so said the ranger).
It was still beautiful, but the trail was frustrating."
22,2018-05-27,[''],"Really pretty hike, but awfully easy to take a wrong turn. :S We started on the west side, and once we got about a half mile up we went left instead of right and ended up on a really pretty forested trail that got us to the same end point. Sorry to the people we passed going the opposite way, because we gave you the directions to the path we took that apparently wasn’t the right trail. It only ended up being a couple miles that way instead of 4. Guess we’ll have to go back to hike the right way sometime."
23,2018-05-21,['hiking'],"This trail is beautiful, and well maintained. My puppy loved all the rushing water. Easy, accessible, tons of parking. It has a beach and a nice dock. I would Highly recommend."
24,2018-05-15,['hiking'],"We did this trail Saturday, and started on the west side. At the beginning the trails are pretty narrow, but open up the further you go in. There are a few places where they narrow again here and there. A bunch of the trail is shaded. It was pouring rain and there was lots of mud, but that didn’t seem to make the hike any more difficult. We took a wrong turn at the end, but I suspect it is because we missed a sign."
25,2018-05-09,['hiking'],"We completed this trail a few days ago and did it in the counter-clockwise direction.  After hiking the full loop, I would recommend going that same direction.  The first .75-1.0 miles are quite exposed to the sun this time of year but once the aspens fill in, shade will show up quicker in your hike.  Be aware that the trailhead is at the dam level, not below it. 

The trail started off with switchbacks which were quite manageable.  After about a mile, the aspens show up and then you quickly transition into pine and spruce.  You will then pass through serene meadows that make you want to stay a long while - do so if you have the time. 

Roughly half-way, there is the only signed intersection.  Continue through in an arc to your left.  It's mostly downhill from this point and gets quite steep.  You will still be under plenty of shade and will eventually cross the creek where you should keep to the left to avoid getting your feet soaked.  The trail exit at the east end of the reservoir where you can decide to continue the hike on its south side in the trees or continue around to the north and go along the road.

The trail seems appropriately rated at moderate and will treat you to quiet, serene moments along with beautiful mountain views."
26,2018-05-07,['hiking'],"Did this yesterday, and was impressed by how few people I could see or hear after the first half mile in, all the way until we got to about the final half mile. The trail is quite narrow for the first 1/3, but becomes more comfortable after that. Lots of trees, so it's moderately shady through most of the hike. I brought a (tree-friendly) hammock in my day pack, and it was so peaceful that my girlfriend and I were able to to take a nice afternoon nap in a meadow."
27,2018-05-04,['hiking'],Did this loop on Sunday and it was great. There are several other loops in the area that we explored on the way down and turned it from a 4 mike hike into a 6+ mile hike.
28,2018-04-28,['hiking'],Great trail and a perfect day for hiking but it isn’t marked at all and we ended up taking a wrong turn which took us up a different mountain. We started on the west side. Next time I’ll take the east side and see how that goes.
29,2018-04-22,[''],"It was ok, it felt like every 15 feet I was walking into someone posing with a photographer friend. So many people doing portraits literally everywhere. It was difficult not to get in peoples photographs and I kept having to repeatedly stop and wait for strangers to finish their portraits. There were even girls taking portraits in the middle of the main road walking the yellow line holding hands. They almost got hit by cars going both ways and then laughed about it. Such a weird experience."
30,2018-01-18,['hiking'],"The first 1/2 to 3/4 mile of the trail, beginning on the west side, was very muddy. It made the trail slippery. After that, the trail was packed snow and very beautiful. Highly recommend micro spikes."
31,2017-09-10,['hiking'],Trail is closed off after 1/2 mile as of 8/27/17
32,2017-08-17,[''],"Left side of the loop was closed but still made it to the meadow, it was beautiful. My dog loved it too."
33,2017-07-15,[''],Good trail but lots of dirt bikes making it loud and smelly. Beautiful trail by the reservoir. Easy to miss the trail head so watch for it before the lake.
34,2017-07-09,[''],"Dirt bikes have turned much of the trail to dusty, loose sand. Still incredible trail. Went a little further up to get the best views."
35,2017-07-06,['hiking'],We only went on the trail surrounding the reservoir and not the full loop. The hike was beautiful but the trail was washed out in a few areas making it pretty difficult to get by. I wouldn't recommend this for kids.
36,2017-07-02,[''],"Really great hike. We ended up taking a wrong turn and went way up into the mountain which has gorgeous views, but the hike went from 4 miles to 8 miles. We are glad we did though. Lots of paths to take, watch out for horses, bikes, and motorbikes.

It was a little muddy and had some water on the trail, but it was a beautiful day with great temperatures!"
37,2017-06-30,[''],Tibble lake was so pretty. we went the end of June and the water was freezing. Would recommend bringing a canoe or a paddle board cause swimming is not really an option.
38,2017-06-26,[''],
39,2017-06-21,[''],Excellent hike. must do
40,2017-06-19,['hiking'],"Definitely a great hike. River was flowing through the trail, so bring water shoes for the first little bit. Steep and rocky incline, but do able. We had our little dog and 3 kids with us. Watch out for motorcycles, as there was quite a few.  Definitely on the more moderate side then easy."
41,2017-06-18,['hiking'],"Pleasant and easy.  The river is still running pretty high on the northern side of the trail (either the start or the end depending on your direction).  Luckily that was near the end.  Big markdowns for the number of motocross on the trail.  Also, a healthy amount of people near the trailhead, though the trail itself was mostly quiet."
42,2017-05-29,['hiking'],fun hike.  kind of tough at spots with a 4 year old but we made it through.  about 2.5 hours with little kids.
43,2017-05-29,['hiking'],"The beginning is gnarly and steep and in the direct sun but after the initial ascent it's shady and beautiful and mild overall. The end is a bit washed out by the river right now just before the bridge so following the trail got a bit confusing. I didn't love having to walk on the busy road to get back to the start/where I parked. Definitely would recommend using a gps for first timers it helped me a lot since there are a lot of different routes and forks.  But me and my doggo loved it, would recommend!"
44,2016-10-16,[''],"Beautiful trail. Dense forest. Be ready for it. GPS , snacks."
45,2016-07-24,[''],"Just an FYI, after making the drive there we were notified that the Tibble & Silver lakes are being drained for the season, and are closed. Nothing is showing this online, so just a heads up! So much for SUP :/"
46,2016-06-08,['hiking'],"I thought trail was more moderate than easy. Make sure and have your GPS on or you could easily take the wrong trail and end up way off course. Also, take lots of bug spray or you will be eaten alive by mosquitos! On an up note, it was very beautiful!"
47,2016-05-30,[''],Moderate in places but really beautiful
48,2016-03-12,[''],"This was a great hike in the winter. We didn't run into too many people, and our pup loved playing in the creek. Snowshoes weren't necessary in January, but they were helpful at times. I would love to do this again in the summer!"
49,2016-01-09,['walking'],It was absolutely beautiful. We went during January and it was a perfect winter wonderland. There's no other way to describe it. Wow.
50,2015-12-21,[''],Great for snowshoeing
51,2015-10-17,['hiking'],Favorite hiking trails.?
52,2015-09-13,['hiking'],"Awesome trail, overrun by dirt bikes though. Be prepared to jump out of the way at a moments notice and inhale a lung full of exhaust."
53,2015-09-09,['bird watching'],Great birds to see. Highly recommended
54,2015-08-25,['hiking'],"The first half of this trail I would rate as Moderate only because it's all uphill. Not steep, but still uphill. It's a pretty hike through the trees and the meadows but that's about it. Nothing terribly amazing."
55,2015-08-11,['hiking'],"Gorgeous hike! It's a combination of three trails total. We started at the Tibble Fork Dam and headed up the Tibble Fork Trail 041. This section of the trail is rather exposed, so go early before the sun clears the ridge. After nearly two miles the trail comes to a crossroads with the Mud Springs Trail 173. Take the left (north) onto the Mud Springs Trail. This drops you into a beautiful meadow. HINT: Venture out into the meadow a ways. Then turn around. The view of the mountains to the North and East are amazing. Perfect place for lunch. The trail then descends down an adjacent canyon back to Tibble Fork Reservoir. The last 1.2 miles of the trail is known as the Mill Canyon Trail. This will lead you to the Mill Canyon Trailhead. Then just walk about half a mile back to the reservoir parking lot. 

I rated this trail as moderate. The incline wasn't bad on the Tibble Fork Trail, but the Mill Canyon Trail is steep and would have been too hard for our little kids (the youngest is 3) to climb up."
56,2015-06-27,[''],If you are hiking in the spring it's very muddy so come prepared. This lake is breathtaking and the hike is pretty easy. Good hike in the summer evening. Bring a picnic dinner to eat by the lake after to enjoy the beauty here.
57,2015-06-24,['hiking'],"The view of the lake from the parking lot is gorgeous. Did this hike in February so there was some snow, but it was still a do able fun hike."
58,2015-04-19,['hiking'],We love the Tibble Fork Reservoir and that is reason enough to go to this trail. We tried this trail in April and it got muddy about 1.5 miles in. What we did do was totally worth it though! Beautiful mountain views! Bonus? This trail was closed to everyone except hikers when we went! That meant we got to enjoy the mountain views with more privacy than you would typically experience. Check out our photos of Tibble Fork Reservoir on our blog here:http://wanderookie.com/blog/2015/04/13/the-pristine-alpine-lake-no-one-is-telling-you-about/
59,2015-04-13,['hiking'],Took this hike in mid-April but didn't have any issues. Very light traffic and only a few snowy areas. Rather muddy in spots but that's spring. Definitely enjoyed it.
60,2015-03-28,['hiking'],"This is a great trail, starting with a beautiful mountain reservoir. The trail is well maintained, and the slope is relatively easy. There will be impressive views as you complete this one. The loop is not one trail, so you'll want to follow Tibble Fork Trail 041 (1.8 miles), take a left on Mud Springs Trail 173 (.8 miles), then another left on Mill Canyon Trail 040 (1.2 miles). Take the dog along for this one. Spend some time at the lake while you're there and soak in the views and do some fishing."
61,2014-07-25,['hiking'],"We hiked this trail starting at the Mill Canyon trail head on Pioneer Day.  I was expecting crowds, but on the contrary it was a very solitary hike for the most part.  Trails taken were the 40 to the 173 and ended on 41.  The trail has a nice variety of scenery including forest, meadow, canyon views, and the beautiful Tibble Fork lake.  The weather was sunny and hot so the hike through the trees for the majority of the hike was a nice refuge from the sun.  It wasn't until you hit the last mile of the descent that you feel the heat from the afternoon sun.  Most of the wildflowers blooms are spent so not much in regards to color but, overall, a great hike.  The trail is in good condition for the most part, with a few deep ruts from the motorcyclists you share the trail with.  We loved cooling our feet off by walking up the river to the car.  It was a great way to end the hike!"
62,2014-06-07,['hiking'],"We took our two 3 year old twins on this hike today and it was great. We started up 041 instead of starting up 040 and it was pretty steep coming down but not bad. Our boys fell a couple of times but nothing bad. It took us 3 hours to do the trail because we had to go at 3 yr old speed and we stopped frequently and ate lunch during our hike as well. 
We saw quite a few people on horses, bikes and motorbikes. 
We didn't know where the hike originally started so I wish there was a better sign saying where to start the trail, or even where to go.
All in all we had a great time and loved the views and the beautiful forest."
63,2014-05-19,['hiking'],went a couple weeks ago. The views were awesome. only downside was that there were a lot of people out since it was such a nice saturday. looks like it could be a nice spot to fish up the creek.
64,2014-05-11,['hiking'],"A great hike!  The scenery was gorgeous and there were hardly any people beyond the first half mile. It was quite a climb and muddy because of the recent stormy weather but not impassible. We did it with four children, the youngest being five years old, and they all made it!  Our child with disabilities was in a hiking stroller pushed by my husband. Getting it up the hill was difficult, but the downhill was so fast and fun!  I would love to do this again mid season when the leaves are out and the flowers are blooming in the meadows."
65,2013-07-11,['hiking'],"This was a nice hike. We went on Memorial Day and were not prepared for the 3-6 inches of mud along the entire trail. There are some steep areas which resulted in many children and adults falling several times into the mud. All in all everyone had a great attitude so it was still a fun loop. I would recommend not going early spring or after heavy rains. We had several beginning hikers with us and the hike felt more strenuous to them...probably because of the steepness coupled with the deep mud. For those of us who hike regularly it was moderate. About halfway through the hike, where you take a left, we ran into a man who had just spotted a bear ahead on the trail. He said he sees him there regularly so just beware. 
All in all we had children from the age of 4 to adults and everyone made it safely and happily back to the cars."
