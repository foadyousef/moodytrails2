0,2019-07-13,['hiking'],A concrete arch! The arch was at least 3 times the size I thought it was looking at the photos. Well worth the moderate climb.
1,2018-11-03,['hiking'],"This is a great little hike.  Though most the leaves have fallen, it was still super beautiful.  We loved walking in a carpet of yellow and gold leaves.  The arch is coolâ€”such strange aggregate rock.  Sweet canyon!  We definitely want to check out more hikes in the area and camp nearby sometime."
2,2018-09-23,['hiking'],"Hiked the arch trail (FS tr #158, Middle Fork Trail) on Sept 22, 2018. One of the most beautiful fall hikes I've ever been on in Utah. Wonderful mix of maples, scrub oak, and evergreens. Lots of varying scenery with mountains, cliffs, forest, and a nice little arch that you can scramble up underneath and climb into a small slot canyon above the arch if you're a little more adventurous and able. Fairly easy and short trail from campground to arch with about 90% shade cover. Heavily used campground with tons of people rock climbing in various spots throughout Maple Canyon, but on this trail on a Saturday afternoon I was surprised that I didn't pass anyone after leaving the campground. 
I continued past the arch further up the Middle Fork trail then turned right (north) and followed the FS tr #124 (Right Fork Trail) to head up to the view points on the cliffs and rock formations above the canyon. Well worth it! The views are amazing looking down into the cliffs and forests below. The Right Fork Trail is a Moderate level hike and is overgrown with scrub oak brush in some areas that will scratch the legs - so I would suggest wearing long pants and not shorts if you choose to hike this section. Right Fork trail from where it leaves the Middle Fork trail is about 70% exposed to the sun until you get past the summit and start to descend through the canyon forest again. On the eastern decent of the Right Fork trail there's one spot that has a 5-6 rung ladder that you'll have to climb up/down - so keep that in mind if you have a dog or small kids. Watching some of the rock climbers on the cliffs throughout the area is also a thrill. One of the best overall hikes I've been on. A definite repeat."
3,2018-08-19,['hiking'],I did this with my 4 kids ages 3-8. We got off course at the rock climbing wall. Should have stayed left away from the wall. Ended up being a treacherous 30 min detour. We got to the arch but my 3yr olds did not hike the steep section up to the arch alcove. The 3yr olds also kept slipping on the loose rocks on the way down. Take it slow!
4,2018-08-04,[''],"We hiked up to the arch with 5 kids 11-3. It was beautiful and shaded most of the hike. The only tough part for the kids was a lot of loose rock, but overall we loved it!"
5,2018-07-17,[''],Our family enjoyed this hike.  The arch was beautiful and so was the view under the arch. It was a little steep to get up to the arch but we braved it and no one got hurt.  Round trip our phones clocked 2 miles.
6,2018-06-22,['hiking'],"Our stats 2.7 miles, 676 ft differed from Alltrails (3.5 miles, 1181 ft), so we actually found this trail easy (though we did not go all the way up and under the arch, as it was steep near the arch and we wanted to get down safely)! (Interestingly, my iPhone compass measured elevation gain differently at only 560 ft.) Well, easier than stated. We started at 8am (on a Saturday, when the campground was full and also plenty of people camping dispersed), so there was no one on the trail, but by the time we exited, people were entering and also starting to climb some of the rock faces closer to the trailhead. I was waiting about a year to do this trail, and found it well worth the wait. In addition to the trail, the drive to the trail and the campground that surrounds the trail are all very scenic. It is quite a heavily trafficked area. There are fees to use this area, $5 for day use unless you have the National Park pass, then it's free. There are pit toilets in the campground."
7,2018-06-22,['hiking'],Interesting Arch good trail
8,2017-11-05,[''],"Saw a bear on the trail. But still cool. We did it in flip flops so it's definitely not hard. I imagine it would be pretty stunning in the early fall but it was pretty dead and gray by the time we did it. Arch was ok, not as big as I expected."
9,2017-10-02,[''],"I love this trail. I think it's so cool to suddenly come upon the be beautiful arch!
We like to do the loop as well. It makes it a pretty good short but heart pumping hike."
10,2017-09-30,[''],"I absolutely love this canyon. This is one of three trails that are up there. There is the arch, a cave, and a beautiful hike to the top. It is also a popular rock climbing area so can catch a peak at Rock climbing."
11,2017-07-26,[''],Well marked trail. Only shared the trail with one other family in passing. Amazing canyon.
12,2017-06-12,[''],nice little trail. mostly up. turn right at the sign and definitely check out the viewpoint if you have some energy and time. Beautiful view and it's a loop so a lot of downhill the way back.
13,2017-05-29,['hiking'],Beautiful trail. The arch was very impressive.
14,2017-05-28,[''],we really liked it. the boys handled it well for being 5 and 3.

16,2015-10-31,[''],great little hike little of an up hike but not too steep.  very unique rock.  Lots of shade.  Would like to come back and do the loop and left fork as well.
17,2015-07-26,['hiking'],"The trail to the arch is marked as only .5 miles (one-way), if you do the entire loop the total distance is around 3.5 miles).  I've made a detailed post (with tracks) about the loop trail (including the arch and the cave and slot canyons) at http://utahtim.com/2015/07/maple-canyon-loop/"
18,2014-10-16,['hiking'],"Fabulous. One of the most interesting trails I've encountered. This canyon is made of a rare rock conglomerate; small to medium rocks of every color but blue 'sealed' together by some geological oddity. The Arch trail is well marked, easy to moderate, becoming steepish toward the top. Coming down the right fork to form a loop, it turns into a more gradual descent as it is a rough dirt road. Safe for the most part and very scenic. A treasure trove for rock hounds. But don't try taking them home."
19,2012-06-15,[''],"It was a short hike from the main parking lot in Maple Canyon.  You must pay $3 to park at the lot.  Be sure to take the middle fork trail, not the Left fork trail.  There are signs that mark the way.  There are fun climbing opportunities around and behind the arch."
